## Consolidated Vulnerability List

### 1. Project Settings File Path Manipulation and Arbitrary File Write via Malicious `projectsLocation` Configuration

* Vulnerability Name: Project Settings File Path Manipulation and Arbitrary File Write via Malicious `projectsLocation` Configuration
* Description:
    1. The Project Manager extension allows users to configure the location of the `projects.json` file using the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting. This setting can be defined in user settings or workspace settings.
    2. An attacker can supply a malicious workspace or trick a user into applying settings that include a manipulated `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting. This can be achieved, for example, via a shared repository or a downloaded workspace file containing malicious settings in `.vscode/settings.json`.
    3. By setting `projectManager.projectsLocation` to a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`), an attacker can manipulate the path where the extension reads and writes the `projects.json` file. For instance, a malicious setting could be `{"projectManager.projectsLocation": "../../../maliciousDir"}`.
    4. When the extension calculates the path to `projects.json` using the `getProjectFilePath()` function, it retrieves the `projectsLocation` setting and expands home directory paths (`~` or `$home`) using `PathUtils.expandHomePath()`.  Critically, it then joins this path with the fixed file name `projects.json` using `path.join()` without any validation or sanitization against directory traversal sequences.
    5. This results in a constructed file path pointing to an attacker-controlled location outside the intended configuration directory.
    6. Subsequently, when the extension attempts to write project data (e.g., when saving a new project using the `"Project Manager: Save Project"` command) or read project data, these file operations are directed to the manipulated path.
    7. This can lead to arbitrary file write, where the `projects.json` file is created or overwritten in an unintended location.  Furthermore, it could also lead to arbitrary file read if the extension attempts to read from this manipulated `projects.json` location.
    8. In addition, when the user opens a project using the Project Manager, the `projectsPicker.ts` module reads the project path from the potentially manipulated `projects.json` file and uses `PathUtils.normalizePath()` to process it before opening the project. If `projects.json` is compromised due to path manipulation, opening a project could lead to accessing files or directories outside the intended project scope, depending on how `PathUtils.normalizePath()` is implemented and how the project path is used in subsequent operations by VS Code's `vscode.openFolder` command.

* Impact:
    - **Arbitrary File Write (High):** An attacker can force the extension to write the `projects.json` file to an arbitrary location on the file system.  In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to arbitrary file overwrite, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite critical system files or user data if they can further influence the file content or location.
    - **Information Disclosure (Medium):** An attacker might be able to read sensitive files if path traversal allows reading outside the intended directory and if sensitive files are located in the traversed paths. This is possible when the extension reads project paths from a manipulated `projects.json` and uses them to access files.
    - **Data Manipulation (Medium):** An attacker can overwrite the `projects.json` file in an unintended location.  Beyond directly impacting the extension's functionality, this could be a stepping stone for more complex attacks. If the attacker can manipulate the content of `projects.json` through path traversal, they might be able to inject malicious project paths. When these projects are opened, it could lead to further vulnerabilities, depending on how VS Code handles project paths and extensions interact with them.

* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided code. The code directly uses the `projectsLocation` setting after minimal processing with `PathUtils.expandHomePath()`.
    - There is no validation or sanitization of the `projectsLocation` setting to prevent directory traversal.
    - The code does not check if the resolved file path for `projects.json` is within an expected safe directory.
    - While `PathUtils.normalizePath()` is used in `quickpick/projectsPicker.ts` when opening projects, its implementation is not provided and it's unclear if it sufficiently sanitizes against path traversal vulnerabilities initiated through the manipulated `projects.json` content.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization:** The extension must sanitize the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting before using it to construct file paths. This sanitization should remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on the `projectsLocation` setting to ensure it conforms to expected path formats and does not contain malicious characters or sequences.
    - **Path Normalization and Base Directory Check:** After expanding home paths and normalizing the path, the extension should verify that the resolved path for `projects.json` lies within a designated safe base directory (e.g., within the user's application data folder). This check can be implemented using secure path resolution functions to prevent traversal outside the allowed boundaries.
    - **Defensive Coding:** Implement fallback mechanisms to ensure that even with a malicious or unexpected `projectsLocation` setting, the extension falls back to a safe default location for `projects.json` and continues to function correctly.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to influence the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting. This can be achieved if:
        - The victim opens a workspace that includes a malicious setting in its `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        - The attacker can somehow modify the user settings, although workspace settings override user settings, making workspace settings a more direct attack vector.
        - Social engineering could be used to trick a user into opening a malicious workspace or applying malicious settings.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/extension.ts` (and other source files)**
    2. **Function: `getProjectFilePath()`**
    3. The `getProjectFilePath()` function is responsible for determining the path to the `projects.json` file.
    4. It retrieves the `projectsLocation` setting from VS Code configuration:
       ```typescript
       const projectsLocation: string = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("projectManager").get<string>("projectsLocation");
       ```
    5. It uses `PathUtils.expandHomePath()` to expand `~` and `$home` in the `projectsLocation`.
       ```typescript
       if (projectsLocation !== "") {
           projectFile = path.join(PathUtils.expandHomePath(projectsLocation), PROJECTS_FILE);
       } else {
           projectFile = PathUtils.getFilePathFromAppData(PROJECTS_FILE);
       }
       ```
    6. **File: `/code/vscode-project-manager-core/src/utils/path.ts`**
    7. **Function: `expandHomePath(filepath: string)`**
    8. `expandHomePath` only handles `~` and `$home` expansion and does not perform any sanitization against directory traversal sequences.
       ```typescript
       public static expandHomePath(filepath: string): string {
           if (!filepath) {
               return filepath;
           }

           if (filepath[0] === '~') {
               filepath = process.env.HOME + filepath.slice(1);
           }

           if (filepath.indexOf('$home') > -1) {
               filepath = filepath.replace('$home', process.env.HOME);
           }

           return filepath;
       }
       ```
    9. The `getProjectFilePath()` function directly uses the potentially malicious `projectsLocation` setting without any validation or sanitization before constructing the `projectFile` path. This allows directory traversal sequences in `projectsLocation` to be directly incorporated into the final file path.
    10. When the extension subsequently performs file operations (read/write `projects.json`), it uses this constructed path, leading to potential arbitrary file write or read.
    11. **File: `/code/src/quickpick/projectsPicker.ts`**
    12. **Function: `pickProjects()` and `openPickedProject()`**
    13. When opening a project, `PathUtils.normalizePath()` is used on `item.description` (project root path from `projects.json`):
        ```typescript
        resolve(<Picked<Project>>{
            item: {
                name: item.label,
                rootPath: PathUtils.normalizePath(item.description),
                profile: item.profile,
            }, button: undefined
        });
        ```
    14. However, the initial vulnerability stems from the unsanitized `projectsLocation` setting allowing manipulation of where `projects.json` is located and potentially its content.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new VS Code workspace in a test directory.
        - Inside the workspace, create a `.vscode` folder and a `settings.json` file within it.
        - In `settings.json`, add the malicious `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting:
          ```json
          {
              "projectManager.projectsLocation": "../../../tmp/maliciousDir"
          }
          ```
          - Ensure the directory `/tmp/maliciousDir` does not exist prior to the test, or choose a different path for testing purposes.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Open the workspace in VS Code.
        - Execute the command `"Project Manager: Save Project"`.
        - Provide a project name (e.g., "test-project") and save the project.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check the file system. Verify if a `projects.json` file has been created in the `/tmp/maliciousDir` directory (or the path specified in the malicious setting).
        - If the file is created in the manipulated location, it confirms that the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting was successfully used to redirect file operations.
    4. **Further Verification (Optional Arbitrary File Overwrite):**
        - If you can control the content of `projects.json` (e.g., by crafting a workspace with a pre-filled, malicious `projects.json` at the manipulated location), you could potentially attempt to overwrite other files by manipulating paths within `projects.json` and triggering extension features that use these paths.
    5. **Conclusion:**
        - If `projects.json` is written to `/tmp/maliciousDir`, the test validates the arbitrary file write vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting.

### 2. Project Path Traversal via Project Name during Project Rename

* Vulnerability Name: Project Path Traversal via Project Name during Project Rename
* Description:
    1. An attacker saves a project using the "Project Manager: Save Project" command. This creates an entry in the `projects.json` file with a `rootPath` based on the current workspace.
    2. The attacker then directly edits the `projects.json` file using the "Project Manager: Edit Project" command.
    3. In the `projects.json` file, the attacker modifies the `rootPath` of the previously saved project to a malicious path containing directory traversal sequences, such as `"../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project"`.
    4. Next, the attacker uses the "Project Manager: Rename Project" command and selects the project they just modified in `projects.json`.
    5. The attacker provides a new name for the project and confirms the rename operation.
    6. During the rename process, and more critically when the user subsequently attempts to open the renamed project using "Project Manager: Open Project", the extension uses the `rootPath` value directly from the `projects.json` file, which has been manipulated by the attacker.
    7. Because the `rootPath` is not re-validated or sanitized during the rename operation or project opening, the extension, when instructed to open the project, will attempt to operate on the file system using the attacker-controlled, traversed path.
    8. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities when VS Code or the extension performs file system operations based on this manipulated `rootPath`.

* Impact:
    - **Path Traversal (High):** An attacker can manipulate the `rootPath` of a project to point to a directory outside the intended project workspace. When the extension or VS Code uses this manipulated `rootPath` for file system operations (e.g., when opening the project), it can lead to path traversal. This may allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive files outside the intended project directory, depending on how the `rootPath` is subsequently used by the extension or VS Code API.

* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the project rename functionality or project opening functionality.
    - The extension trusts the `rootPath` value stored in `projects.json` without re-validation or sanitization during the rename operation, even after the user has had the opportunity to directly edit the `projects.json` file.
    - Similarly, when opening a project, the `rootPath` from `projects.json` is used without validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization of `rootPath` during project rename:**  Especially after the user can directly edit `projects.json`, the `rootPath` should be re-validated when renaming a project.
    - **Re-resolve or prompt for rootPath on rename:** Instead of blindly trusting the `rootPath` in `projects.json`, the extension should re-resolve the project's root path from the workspace or prompt the user to confirm the new root path during the rename operation.
    - **Input validation and sanitization of `rootPath` when opening a project:** Before using the `rootPath` from `projects.json` to open a folder, the extension should validate and sanitize the path to prevent path traversal.

* Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must be able to save a project using the extension, establishing an initial entry in `projects.json`.
    2. The attacker must be able to edit the `projects.json` file directly using the "Project Manager: Edit Project" command.
    3. The attacker must be able to trigger the "Project Manager: Rename Project" command for the project whose `rootPath` they have manipulated.
    4. To exploit the path traversal, the attacker or a victim user must subsequently attempt to open the renamed project using "Project Manager: Open Project".

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/extension.ts:renameProject(node)` function:**
        ```typescript
        function renameProject(node: any) {
            const oldName: string = node.command.arguments[1];
            // ... input box to get newName ...
            vscode.window.showInputBox(ibo).then(newName => {
                if (typeof newName === "undefined" || newName === oldName) {
                    return;
                }
                // ... validation for newName ...
                if (!projectStorage.exists(newName) || newName.toLowerCase() === oldName.toLowerCase()) {
                    Container.stack.rename(oldName, newName)
                    projectStorage.rename(oldName, newName); // Renames project in storage (projects.json)
                    projectStorage.save();
                    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(l10n.t("Project renamed!"));
                    updateStatusBar(oldName, node.command.arguments[0], newName); // Uses node.command.arguments[0] which is rootPath
                } else {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage(l10n.t("Project already exists!"));
                }
            });
        }
        ```
        - The `renameProject` function retrieves the `rootPath` from `node.command.arguments[0]`. This `node` object originates from the tree view, which is populated from `projects.json`. Thus, `node.command.arguments[0]` directly reflects the `rootPath` value as it is stored in `projects.json`, which can be attacker-manipulated.
        - The `renameProject` function does not re-validate `node.command.arguments[0]` (the `rootPath`). It trusts this value throughout the rename process and when updating the status bar and, critically, when the project is subsequently opened.

    2. **`src/statusBar.ts:updateStatusBar(oldName, oldPath, newName)` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function updateStatusBar(oldName: string, oldPath: string, newName: string): void {
          if (statusItem.text === codicons.file_directory + " " + oldName && statusItem.tooltip === oldPath) {
              statusItem.text = codicons.file_directory + " " + newName;
          }
        }
        ```
        - `updateStatusBar` receives `oldPath` (the manipulated `rootPath`) and updates the status bar. While not directly exploitable itself, it demonstrates the propagation of the malicious path within the extension.

    3. **`projects.json` file:**
        - This file is the storage location for project configurations, including the `rootPath`.
        - The vulnerability relies on the attacker's ability to modify the `rootPath` values within this file directly.

    4. **`src/quickpick/projectsPicker.ts:openPickedProject(picked, forceNewWindow, calledFrom)` function:**
        ```typescript
        export async function openPickedProject(picked: Picked<Project>, forceNewWindow: boolean, calledFrom: CommandLocation) {
            if (!picked) { return }
            // ...
            const uri = buildProjectUri(picked.item.rootPath); // rootPath from projects.json is used here
            commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, { forceProfile: picked.item.profile, forceNewWindow: openInNewWindow })
                .then(
                    () => ({}),  // done
                    () => window.showInformationMessage(l10n.t("Could not open the project!")));
        }
        ```
        - The `openPickedProject` function retrieves `picked.item.rootPath`, which is initially read from `projects.json` and passed through the `renameProject` function without validation. If this `rootPath` has been maliciously modified in `projects.json`, `buildProjectUri` will create a URI with the malicious path.
        - `commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` then uses this potentially malicious URI to open the folder, directly leading to path traversal when VS Code attempts to open the specified (manipulated) directory.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code with the Project Manager extension installed.
    2. Save any folder as a project using "Project Manager: Save Project", naming it "test-project". Choose any folder for this initial project.
    3. Execute "Project Manager: Edit Project" to open the `projects.json` file in the editor.
    4. In `projects.json`, find the entry for "test-project" and change its `rootPath` value to `"../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project"`. Ensure that the directory `/tmp/evil_project` exists for testing, or choose another accessible path for observation. Save the `projects.json` file.
    5. Execute "Project Manager: Rename Project".
    6. From the project list, select "test-project".
    7. Enter a new name, for example, "renamed-project", and press Enter to confirm the rename.
    8. Execute "Project Manager: Open Project".
    9. Select "renamed-project" from the project list.
    10. Observe VS Code's behavior. VS Code will attempt to open the folder at `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project`. While VS Code might have some internal path validation and might not fully open system-critical directories, the extension is directing VS Code to access a location dictated by the manipulated `rootPath`.
    11. To confirm path traversal, observe file system access attempts to `/tmp/evil_project` or monitor for any errors or unexpected behavior related to accessing paths outside the intended workspace. In a more complete exploitation scenario, further actions within the extension or VS Code that utilize the project's `rootPath` after opening could be leveraged to perform actions within the traversed directory.
    12. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** VS Code attempts to open or access files in the manipulated path, demonstrating that path traversal is possible when opening renamed projects with a maliciously modified `rootPath` from `projects.json`.
