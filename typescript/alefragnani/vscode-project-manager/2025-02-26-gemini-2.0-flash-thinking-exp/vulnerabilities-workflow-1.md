## Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal when Opening Projects (Arbitrary File Access via Malicious Project Entry)

  - **Description:**
    1. The Project Manager extension stores project paths in a `projects.json` file.
    2. When a user selects a project to open, the extension reads the `rootPath` from the `projects.json` file.
    3. The extension then uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` to open the project in VS Code.
    4. If the `rootPath` in `projects.json` is maliciously crafted to be an absolute path outside the intended workspace or to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`), the extension will open that arbitrary folder.
    5. An attacker could potentially modify the `projects.json` file (if they have local access, social engineer the user, exploit another vulnerability, or through a supply-chain attack) to point to a sensitive directory.
    6. When the user, unaware of the modification, selects this project from the Project Manager list (via commands like “Project Manager: List Projects to Open” or “open in new window”), VS Code will open the attacker-specified directory.
    7. This could lead to unauthorized access to files and information within the opened directory, depending on the user's permissions and the sensitivity of the directory. The attacker may cause the user’s environment to open an unintended (and possibly sensitive) folder.

  - **Impact:**
    - High: Unauthorized file system access and potential information disclosure. If an attacker can modify the `projects.json` file, they can trick a user into opening arbitrary directories on their file system. This could lead to information disclosure if sensitive files are present in the opened directory. In some scenarios, if the opened directory contains executable files and the user inadvertently executes them within VS Code's context, it could potentially lead to further compromise. This “arbitrary file access” (or disclosure) could lead to further compromise if the attacker is able to steer user action.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The extension does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `rootPath` when loading projects from `projects.json` or when opening them. The `PathUtils.normalizePath` function is used, but it primarily deals with path format consistency and not security-related path traversal prevention.
    - When listing projects in the quick–pick UI, the extension does check whether the supplied folder exists (using `fs.existsSync`) and even warns when it cannot be found. However, the checks do not enforce that the “rootPath” value comes from an expected or “safe” directory.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the `rootPath` read from `projects.json`. It should ensure that the path is within the expected workspace or restrict it to a predefined set of allowed directories. Path traversal sequences (`..`) should be explicitly disallowed or resolved to a safe path.
    - Consider using VS Code's workspace API more restrictively: Investigate if VS Code's API provides mechanisms to restrict the directories that extensions can open or access, and implement those restrictions if available.
    - There is no input validation or whitelist enforcement to ensure that the supplied folder path is within an allowed location (for example, contained within the user’s home directory or another trusted base folder).
    - There is no check to verify that the “rootPath” really refers to a folder (as opposed to a file) or to reject paths that use directory–traversal sequences.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the `projects.json` file. This could be achieved through:
        - Local access to the user's machine.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows writing to the user's file system or VS Code settings storage.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into manually modifying the `projects.json` file or via a malicious configuration update.
        - If a supply–chain attack injects a malicious version of the file.
    - User must have saved projects using the Project Manager extension, creating a `projects.json` file.
    - User must select and attempt to open the maliciously modified project from the Project Manager's list.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/extension.ts:getProjectFilePath()`**: This function determines the path to the `projects.json` file. It respects the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting, allowing users to customize the location, but does not impose any restrictions on the path itself. In the function that determines the projects file’s location (see `/code/src/extension.ts` → `getProjectFilePath`), the path is built by joining a (user–controlled) configuration value with a constant filename without further validation.
    2. **`src/extension.ts:loadProjectsFile()`**: This function uses `projectStorage.load()` to load projects from the `projects.json` file.
    3. **`vscode-project-manager-core/src/storage/index.ts:ProjectStorage.load()`**: This function reads the `projects.json` file and parses its content as JSON. It stores the project data, including `rootPath`, without any validation or sanitization.
    4. **`src/extension.ts:_projectManager.open` and `src/extension.ts:_projectManager.openInNewWindow`**: These commands are triggered when a user selects a project to open (either in the same or new window). They retrieve the `projectPath` from the command arguments (which originates from the loaded project data) and use `buildProjectUri(projectPath)` to create a URI. Later, in commands such as “_projectManager.open” and in the helper function `buildProjectUri()`, the unsanitized “rootPath” value is used directly when calling `vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, …)`.
    5. **`vscode-project-manager-core/src/utils/uri.ts:buildProjectUri(projectPath)`**: This function converts the `projectPath` string into a `vscode.Uri`. It performs basic path normalization using `PathUtils.normalizePath`, but does not validate or sanitize the path for security vulnerabilities like path traversal.
    6. **`src/extension.ts:_projectManager.open` and `src/extension.ts:_projectManager.openInNewWindow`**: Finally, `vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` is called with the constructed URI. VS Code itself will open the folder specified by the URI, without further validation from the Project Manager extension.

    ```typescript
    // Visualization of data flow for opening a project:

    projects.json --> ProjectStorage.load() --> project data (including rootPath) -->
    _projectManager.open / _projectManager.openInNewWindow (commands) --> projectPath -->
    buildProjectUri(projectPath) --> vscode.Uri --> vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...) --> VS Code opens folder
    ```

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure Project Manager extension is installed and activated in VS Code.
    2. **Setup:**
        a. Create a `projects.json` file (if one doesn't exist) at the expected location for Project Manager (usually in VS Code's user data directory).
        b. Add a new project entry to `projects.json` with a maliciously crafted `rootPath` pointing to a sensitive directory on your system, for example, your home directory or system configuration directory. Example `projects.json` entry:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "name": "Malicious Project",
                "rootPath": "/home/user"  // or "C:\\Windows\\System32" on Windows, or "../../../" to traverse up from workspace
                "tags": [],
                "enabled": true
            }
        ]
        ```
        c. Save the modified `projects.json` file. Or Manually modify (or simulate a malicious update of) the “projects.json” file so that it contains an entry with a name (e.g. “SensitiveFiles”) and a “rootPath” pointing to a sensitive directory (for example, “/etc” on Linux or “C:\Windows” on Windows).
    3. **Steps:**
        a. Open VS Code.
        b. Use the command `Project Manager: List Projects to Open` or access the Project Manager Side Bar.
        c. Select the "Malicious Project" or "SensitiveFiles" project from the list.
    4. **Expected Result:** VS Code should open the directory specified in the malicious `rootPath` (e.g., `/home/user` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`). Verify that VS Code attempts to open the folder at the supplied “rootPath” and that the user is (unintentionally) exposed to its contents.
    5. **Verification:**
        a. Verify that VS Code has opened the targeted sensitive directory.
        b. Observe if you can browse files and directories within the opened directory in VS Code's explorer.
        c. Confirm that proper warnings or rejections are not in place and document the behavior.
    6. **Cleanup:** Remove or modify the malicious project entry from `projects.json` to prevent accidental opening of sensitive directories in the future.

    This test case demonstrates that the extension opens projects based on paths from `projects.json` without proper validation, allowing path traversal and potentially unauthorized access if `projects.json` is compromised.

- **Vulnerability Name:** UI Spoofing via Malicious Project Name Injection

  - **Description:**
    1. The extension accepts and stores project names provided by the user without applying full sanitization when saving projects (e.g., via `saveProject()` function).
    2. An attacker can inject a malicious project name by modifying the `projects.json` file. This name can include codicon markup (starting with "$(") or HTML-like payloads.
    3. When the extension loads projects and displays the project name in the VS Code status bar (using `/code/src/statusBar.ts`), it concatenates the unsanitized project name into `statusItem.text` without filtering or escaping.
    4. VS Code renders the status bar text, interpreting the malicious markup or payload.
    5. This can lead to UI spoofing where the status bar text is misleading or confusing, potentially mimicking trusted UI elements or misrepresenting the active project.
    6. A user may be tricked into believing that a project is genuine or safe even when it has been maliciously manipulated. This UI spoofing can lead to phishing–like scenarios or prompt the user to execute unintended commands.

  - **Impact:**
    - High: UI Spoofing leading to user confusion and potential phishing attacks. A user may be tricked into believing a malicious project is safe, potentially leading to unintended actions or security compromises.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The quick–pick selection code (in `/code/src/quickpick/projectsPicker.ts`) checks whether an item’s label begins with “$(” and if so shows an error message to prevent selection. However, this check is only applied to the quick–pick UI and not when rendering the project’s name in the status bar.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no sanitization of the project name when it is stored or later used to update the status bar (see `/code/src/statusBar.ts`).
    - A robust validation should be implemented for any project name input so that dangerous patterns (such as those beginning with “$(” or containing HTML–like tags) are rejected or escaped.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to influence the content of the “projects.json” file (e.g. via social engineering or a supply–chain compromise) in order to insert a project name containing malicious payload.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`/code/src/saveYourFavoriteProjects.*` (e.g., `saveProject()` in `/code/src/extension.ts`)**: The user–provided project name is taken from the input box and stored with no additional sanitization.
    2. **`/code/src/statusBar.ts`**: The project name is simply concatenated (along with a codicon string) into `statusItem.text` and then displayed in the status bar. There is no filtering or escaping applied here.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Modify the “projects.json” file to include a project entry with a name such as
       ```json
       { "name": "$(<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>)_Malicious", "rootPath": "C:\\Users\\Public" }
       ```
       (or a similar payload appropriate for your operating system).
    2. Ensure the extension reloads this project entry (for example by triggering a refresh or restarting the extension).
    3. Observe the status bar display in VS Code; verify that the malicious payload is rendered as part of the status text.
    4. Check that no additional warning or sanitization is triggered and document that a malicious project name can be used to spoof UI elements.
