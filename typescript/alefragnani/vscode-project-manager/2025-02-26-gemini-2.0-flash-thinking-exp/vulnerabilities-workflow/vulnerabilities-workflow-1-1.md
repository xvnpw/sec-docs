### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal when Opening Projects

- Description:
    1. The Project Manager extension stores project paths in a `projects.json` file.
    2. When a user selects a project to open, the extension reads the `rootPath` from the `projects.json` file.
    3. The extension then uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` to open the project in VS Code.
    4. If the `rootPath` in `projects.json` is maliciously crafted to be an absolute path outside the intended workspace or to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`), the extension will open that arbitrary folder.
    5. An attacker could potentially modify the `projects.json` file (if they have local access or can somehow influence its content through other means) to point to a sensitive directory.
    6. When the user, unaware of the modification, selects this project from the Project Manager list, VS Code will open the attacker-specified directory.
    7. This could lead to unauthorized access to files and information within the opened directory, depending on the user's permissions and the sensitivity of the directory.

- Impact:
    - High: Unauthorized file system access. If an attacker can modify the `projects.json` file (locally or via some other means), they can trick a user into opening arbitrary directories on their file system. This could lead to information disclosure if sensitive files are present in the opened directory. In some scenarios, if the opened directory contains executable files and the user inadvertently executes them within VS Code's context, it could potentially lead to further compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The extension does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `rootPath` when loading projects from `projects.json` or when opening them. The `PathUtils.normalizePath` function is used, but it primarily deals with path format consistency and not security-related path traversal prevention.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the `rootPath` read from `projects.json`. It should ensure that the path is within the expected workspace or restrict it to a predefined set of allowed directories. Path traversal sequences (`..`) should be explicitly disallowed or resolved to a safe path.
    - Consider using VS Code's workspace API more restrictively: Investigate if VS Code's API provides mechanisms to restrict the directories that extensions can open or access, and implement those restrictions if available.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the `projects.json` file. This could be achieved through:
        - Local access to the user's machine.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows writing to the user's file system or VS Code settings storage.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into manually modifying the `projects.json` file.
    - User must have saved projects using the Project Manager extension, creating a `projects.json` file.
    - User must select and attempt to open the maliciously modified project from the Project Manager's list.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/extension.ts:getProjectFilePath()`**: This function determines the path to the `projects.json` file. It respects the `projectManager.projectsLocation` setting, allowing users to customize the location, but does not impose any restrictions on the path itself.
    2. **`src/extension.ts:loadProjectsFile()`**: This function uses `projectStorage.load()` to load projects from the `projects.json` file.
    3. **`vscode-project-manager-core/src/storage/index.ts:ProjectStorage.load()`**: This function reads the `projects.json` file and parses its content as JSON. It stores the project data, including `rootPath`, without any validation or sanitization.
    4. **`src/extension.ts:_projectManager.open` and `src/extension.ts:_projectManager.openInNewWindow`**: These commands are triggered when a user selects a project to open (either in the same or new window). They retrieve the `projectPath` from the command arguments (which originates from the loaded project data) and use `buildProjectUri(projectPath)` to create a URI.
    5. **`vscode-project-manager-core/src/utils/uri.ts:buildProjectUri(projectPath)`**: This function converts the `projectPath` string into a `vscode.Uri`. It performs basic path normalization using `PathUtils.normalizePath`, but does not validate or sanitize the path for security vulnerabilities like path traversal.
    6. **`src/extension.ts:_projectManager.open` and `src/extension.ts:_projectManager.openInNewWindow`**: Finally, `vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` is called with the constructed URI. VS Code itself will open the folder specified by the URI, without further validation from the Project Manager extension.

    ```typescript
    // Visualization of data flow for opening a project:

    projects.json --> ProjectStorage.load() --> project data (including rootPath) -->
    _projectManager.open / _projectManager.openInNewWindow (commands) --> projectPath -->
    buildProjectUri(projectPath) --> vscode.Uri --> vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...) --> VS Code opens folder
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure Project Manager extension is installed and activated in VS Code.
    2. **Setup:**
        a. Create a `projects.json` file (if one doesn't exist) at the expected location for Project Manager (usually in VS Code's user data directory).
        b. Add a new project entry to `projects.json` with a maliciously crafted `rootPath` pointing to a sensitive directory on your system, for example, your home directory or system configuration directory. Example `projects.json` entry:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "name": "Malicious Project",
                "rootPath": "/home/user"  // or "C:\\Windows\\System32" on Windows, or "../../../" to traverse up from workspace
                "tags": [],
                "enabled": true
            }
        ]
        ```
        c. Save the modified `projects.json` file.
    3. **Steps:**
        a. Open VS Code.
        b. Use the command `Project Manager: List Projects to Open` or access the Project Manager Side Bar.
        c. Select the "Malicious Project" from the list.
    4. **Expected Result:** VS Code should open the directory specified in the malicious `rootPath` (e.g., `/home/user` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`).
    5. **Verification:**
        a. Verify that VS Code has opened the targeted sensitive directory.
        b. Observe if you can browse files and directories within the opened directory in VS Code's explorer.
    6. **Cleanup:** Remove or modify the malicious project entry from `projects.json` to prevent accidental opening of sensitive directories in the future.

This test case demonstrates that the extension opens projects based on paths from `projects.json` without proper validation, allowing path traversal and potentially unauthorized access if `projects.json` is compromised.
