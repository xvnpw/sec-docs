### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Project Path Traversal via Project Name during Project Rename

- Description:
    1. Attacker saves a project using the "Project Manager: Save Project" command.
    2. Attacker edits the `projects.json` file directly (using "Project Manager: Edit Project") and modifies the `rootPath` of the saved project to a malicious path, e.g., "../../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious_folder".
    3. Attacker uses the "Project Manager: Rename Project" command and selects the project they modified.
    4. Attacker provides a new name for the project.
    5. The extension renames the project in `projects.json` but uses the potentially attacker-controlled `rootPath` from the `projects.json` file in subsequent operations, such as when the user tries to open the project using "Project Manager: Open Project". This can lead to path traversal if the application or underlying OS performs operations based on this `rootPath` without proper validation during rename operation and when opening the project.

- Impact:
    - High. An attacker can manipulate the `rootPath` of a project to point to a directory outside the intended project workspace. When the extension or other parts of the application use this manipulated `rootPath` for file system operations (e.g., when opening the project), it can lead to path traversal. This could allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive files outside the project directory, depending on how the `rootPath` is subsequently used by the extension or VS Code API.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the project rename functionality itself or project opening functionality. The extension relies on the user providing valid paths initially and doesn't re-validate or sanitize the `rootPath` during the rename operation after it might have been tampered with in `projects.json`, nor when opening the project.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `rootPath` when renaming a project, especially after the user has had the opportunity to directly edit the `projects.json` file.
    - When renaming a project, the extension should re-resolve the project's root path from the workspace or prompt the user to confirm the new root path, rather than blindly trusting the value in `projects.json`.
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `rootPath` when opening a project. Before using the `rootPath` to open a folder, the extension should validate and sanitize the path to prevent path traversal.

- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker must be able to save a project using the extension.
    2. Attacker must be able to edit the `projects.json` file directly (via "Project Manager: Edit Project").
    3. Attacker must be able to trigger the "Project Manager: Rename Project" command for the modified project.
    4. Attacker needs to trigger "Project Manager: Open Project" to exploit the path traversal after renaming.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/extension.ts:renameProject(node)` function:**
        ```typescript
        function renameProject(node: any) {
            const oldName: string = node.command.arguments[1];
            // ... input box to get newName ...
            vscode.window.showInputBox(ibo).then(newName => {
                if (typeof newName === "undefined" || newName === oldName) {
                    return;
                }
                // ... validation for newName ...
                if (!projectStorage.exists(newName) || newName.toLowerCase() === oldName.toLowerCase()) {
                    Container.stack.rename(oldName, newName)
                    projectStorage.rename(oldName, newName); // Renames project in storage (projects.json)
                    projectStorage.save();
                    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(l10n.t("Project renamed!"));
                    updateStatusBar(oldName, node.command.arguments[0], newName); // Uses node.command.arguments[0] which is rootPath
                } else {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage(l10n.t("Project already exists!"));
                }
            });
        }
        ```
        - The `renameProject` function retrieves the `rootPath` from `node.command.arguments[0]`. This `node` object originates from the tree view, which is populated from the `projects.json` file.
        - If an attacker modifies the `rootPath` in `projects.json` to a malicious path, this path will be used when `updateStatusBar` is called and more importantly when opening the project later.
        - The vulnerability is that `renameProject` trusts `node.command.arguments[0]` without re-validation, especially after the user can directly edit `projects.json`.

    2. **`src/statusBar.ts:updateStatusBar(oldName, oldPath, newName)` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function updateStatusBar(oldName: string, oldPath: string, newName: string): void {
          if (statusItem.text === codicons.file_directory + " " + oldName && statusItem.tooltip === oldPath) {
              statusItem.text = codicons.file_directory + " " + newName;
          }
        }
        ```
        - `updateStatusBar` receives `oldPath` which originates from `node.command.arguments[0]` in `renameProject`.
        - While `updateStatusBar` itself doesn't perform dangerous file operations, it highlights that the potentially malicious `oldPath` is being passed around within the extension.

    3. **`projects.json` file:**
        - This file stores project configurations, including `rootPath`.
        - Attackers can modify this file directly using "Project Manager: Edit Project".

    4. **`src/quickpick/projectsPicker.ts:openPickedProject(picked, forceNewWindow, calledFrom)` function:**
        ```typescript
        export async function openPickedProject(picked: Picked<Project>, forceNewWindow: boolean, calledFrom: CommandLocation) {
            if (!picked) { return }

            if (!picked.button) {
                if (!forceNewWindow && !await canSwitchOnActiveWindow(calledFrom)) {
                    return;
                }
            }

            Container.stack.push(picked.item.name);
            Container.context.globalState.update("recent", Container.stack.toString());

            const openInNewWindow = shouldOpenInNewWindow(forceNewWindow || !!picked.button, calledFrom);
            const uri = buildProjectUri(picked.item.rootPath); // rootPath from projects.json is used here
            commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, { forceProfile: picked.item.profile, forceNewWindow: openInNewWindow })
                .then(
                    () => ({}),  // done
                    () => window.showInformationMessage(l10n.t("Could not open the project!")));
        }
        ```
        - `openPickedProject` function uses `picked.item.rootPath` which is read from `projects.json`. If this `rootPath` is maliciously modified, `buildProjectUri` will create a URI with the malicious path.
        - `commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, ...)` then opens the folder using the potentially malicious URI, leading to path traversal.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code with the Project Manager extension installed.
    2. Save any folder as a project using "Project Manager: Save Project", name it "test-project".
    3. Execute "Project Manager: Edit Project" to open the `projects.json` file.
    4. In `projects.json`, locate the entry for "test-project" and modify its `rootPath` to `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project`. Save the `projects.json` file.
    5. In VS Code, execute "Project Manager: Rename Project".
    6. In the project list, select "test-project".
    7. Enter a new name, e.g., "renamed-project", and press Enter.
    8. Execute "Project Manager: Open Project".
    9. Select "renamed-project" from the project list.
    10. Observe that VS Code attempts to open the folder at `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project`. While VS Code itself might have some internal path validation, the extension is directing VS Code to open a potentially attacker-controlled location. In a real-world scenario, if the extension or other features were to perform file operations based on this `rootPath` after opening the project, it would operate within the `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil_project` path due to path traversal.
    11. To further verify the impact in a real scenario, you would need to identify other features in the extension or VS Code that might use the project's `rootPath` for file system operations after the project is opened and craft a test case that demonstrates malicious file access or modification based on the traversed path. For this code snippet, the vulnerability is high-ranked due to the successful path traversal during project opening after rename and malicious `rootPath` injection.
