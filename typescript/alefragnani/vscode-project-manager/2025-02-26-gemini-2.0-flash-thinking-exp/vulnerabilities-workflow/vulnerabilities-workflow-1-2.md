- **Vulnerability Name:**
  Arbitrary File Write via Malicious `projectsLocation` Configuration

- **Description:**
  The extension determines the path of its projects file by reading the configuration value for
  `"projectManager.projectsLocation"`. This value is taken directly (via workspace settings) and passed to a home–directory expansion function (via `PathUtils.expandHomePath`), then joined with the fixed file name (`projects.json`) without any further validation. An attacker who can trick a user into opening a workspace (or otherwise causing configuration settings to be applied) that contains a malicious setting (for example, using relative paths with directory–traversal tokens) can force the extension to read from or write to an arbitrary location on disk.
  **Step by step how to trigger:**
  1. The attacker supplies a workspace (for example, via a shared repository or a downloaded workspace file) whose settings include a value similar to:
     ```json
     {
         "projectManager.projectsLocation": "../../../maliciousDir"
     }
     ```
  2. When the victim opens this workspace in VS Code, the extension calls its internal method (in `getProjectFilePath()`) to compute the file path for the projects file.
  3. The unsanitized value is expanded (replacing `"~"` or `"$home"` if present) and then joined with `"projects.json"`, resulting in a path outside the intended safe directory (for example, somewhere outside the user’s dedicated application data folder).
  4. Later—when the extension writes project data (for example, after the user saves a new project via the `"projectManager.saveProject"` command)—the projects file is persisted to this attacker–controlled location.
  5. As a result, an attacker may overwrite an arbitrary file (if they can further influence the file content or location) or cause the extension to read data from a location it should not normally use.

- **Impact:**
  An attacker who can supply or influence workspace settings may force the extension to write its project data (or possibly read data) from an arbitrary path. In a worst–case scenario, this could lead to arbitrary file overwrite on the victim’s system, with potential for information disclosure or even remote code execution (if critical files are overwritten).

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code reads the configuration value and passes it directly to a home–expansion utility and `path.join` without any bounds checking or sanitization.
  - There is no check to ensure that the final resolved file path lies within a safe directory (for example, the user’s expected data folder).
  - (There is no mitigation present in the code that explicitly defends against a malicious value in `projectManager.projectsLocation`.)

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The extension should validate and sanitize any configuration value used to compute file system paths.
  - In particular, after expanding and normalizing the path the code should check (for example, using path resolution functions) that the resolved path is within an allowed base directory (such as the user’s home folder or a preconfigured safe directory).
  - Defensive coding should be added so that even if a workspace supplies an unexpected (or malicious) path, the extension either ignores it or falls back to a safe default.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The victim must open a workspace or have settings applied (via workspace configuration) containing a malicious `"projectManager.projectsLocation"` value.
  - Since workspace settings override user settings, an attacker who can deliver a malicious workspace (for example, via a shared repository or by luring the user to open a downloaded workspace file) can trigger this vulnerability.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. In the method below (located in several of the project’s source files such as in `src/extension.ts`), the projects file path is computed:
     ```js
     function getProjectFilePath() {
         let projectFile: string;
         const projectsLocation: string = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("projectManager").get<string>("projectsLocation");
         if (projectsLocation !== "") {
             projectFile = path.join(PathUtils.expandHomePath(projectsLocation), PROJECTS_FILE);
         } else {
             projectFile = PathUtils.getFilePathFromAppData(PROJECTS_FILE);
         }
         return projectFile;
     }
     ```
  2. Notice that the function takes the full value of `"projectManager.projectsLocation"` from the VS Code configuration (which might come from a workspace settings file), passes it to a function that simply handles the tilde–or–`$home` replacement, and then uses Node’s `path.join` to append the fixed file name.
  3. There is no validation or normalization step to ensure that the resulting file path does not use directory–traversal (for example, using sequences like `../`) to land outside a permitted directory.
  4. As a result, a malicious configuration value (for example, `"../../../maliciousDir"`) will produce a file path that an attacker controls.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     – Create a new VS Code workspace in a directory controlled for testing.
     – In the workspace’s settings (for example, in `.vscode/settings.json`), specify a malicious projects location:
       ```json
       {
           "projectManager.projectsLocation": "../../../maliciousDir"
       }
       ```
     – Ensure that the directory corresponding to the resolved path does not normally exist in the safe location.
  2. **Execution:**
     – Open the malicious workspace in VS Code.
     – Use the extension (for example, execute the `"projectManager.saveProject"` command to save a new project).
     – Observe that the extension calls `getProjectFilePath()` and resolves the projects file path based on the malicious setting.
  3. **Verification:**
     – Check the file system and verify that a file named `projects.json` has been created or overwritten in the location corresponding to the path resolved from the malicious setting (i.e. outside the intended safe directory).
     – Confirm that by changing the setting to the malicious value, an arbitrary file write has occurred.
  4. **Conclusion:**
     – The test validates that a malicious configuration value can force the extension to write its data to an attacker–controlled location, proving the arbitrary file write vulnerability.

*Note:* Because workspace settings are trusted by default, this vulnerability relies on social engineering or a malicious workspace file delivered by an attacker. Nonetheless, unsanitized path configuration values remain a high–risk vector and should be validated before use.
