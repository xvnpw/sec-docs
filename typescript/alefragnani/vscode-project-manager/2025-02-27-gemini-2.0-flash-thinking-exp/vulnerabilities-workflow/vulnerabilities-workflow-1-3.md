### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Reveal via "Reveal in OS" command

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious project entry with a `rootPath` pointing to a sensitive file or directory on the user's system. This can be achieved by manually editing the `projects.json` file or potentially by exploiting a flaw in project auto-detection (though less likely).
    2. The user opens Visual Studio Code with the Project Manager extension activated.
    3. The malicious project entry is loaded into the Project Manager sidebar.
    4. The user, either unknowingly or through social engineering, right-clicks on the malicious project in the Project Manager sidebar.
    5. From the context menu, the user selects "Reveal in Finder", "Reveal in Explorer", or "Reveal in File Manager" depending on their operating system.
    6. The `_projectManager.revealInFinder#sideBar`, `_projectManager.revealInExplorer#sideBar`, or `_projectManager.revealInFileManager#sideBar` command is executed, passing the malicious `rootPath` as an argument.
    7. The `revealFileInOS` function in `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts` is invoked, which directly uses the provided `rootPath` without validation to execute the `revealFileInOS` command.
    8. Visual Studio Code's `revealFileInOS` command opens the operating system's file explorer (Finder, Explorer, File Manager) and reveals the file or directory specified by the malicious `rootPath`, potentially exposing sensitive information to the user's view.

- Impact:
    - High. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to trick a user into revealing arbitrary files and directories on their local file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, or other data that the attacker should not have access to.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code in `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts` directly uses the provided path without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation in the `revealFileInOS` function in `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts` to verify that the provided path:
        - Belongs to a project that is managed by the extension.
        - Is within the allowed project base folders or saved project root paths.
        - Does not traverse outside of the intended project directory (path traversal prevention).
    - Implement sanitization of the path to prevent any malicious injection.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Project Manager extension installed and activated in Visual Studio Code.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the project list or project entries displayed in the Project Manager sidebar. For example, by convincing the user to manually add a malicious project entry or if there's an exploit in auto-detection logic.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts`
    ```typescript
    async function revealFileInOS(node: any) {
        if (!node) { return }

        if (isRemotePath(node.command.arguments[ 0 ])) {
            const revealApp = isWindows ? "Explorer" : isMacOS ? "Finder" : "File Manager";
            window.showErrorMessage(l10n.t("Remote projects can't be revealed in {0}", revealApp));
        }

        commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))
    }
    export function registerRevealFileInOS() {
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInFinder#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInExplorer#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInFileManager#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
    }
    ```
    - Visualization:
        ```
        [Sidebar Context Menu] --> _projectManager.revealIn... command --> revealFileInOS(node)
                                                                        |
                                                                        v
                                                commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))
        ```
    - The `revealFileInOS` function directly takes `node.command.arguments[0]` as a path and passes it to `commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(...))`. There is no validation of `node.command.arguments[0]` to ensure it is a safe path or within allowed project bounds before revealing it in the OS file explorer.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the Project Manager extension installed in VSCode.
    2. **Edit `projects.json`:** Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and run "Project Manager: Edit Projects". This will open your `projects.json` file.
    3. **Add Malicious Project Entry:** Add the following project entry to your `projects.json` array. Replace `/etc/passwd` with a sensitive file path relevant to your OS if needed (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Malicious Project Reveal Test",
            "rootPath": "/etc/passwd",
            "tags": [],
            "enabled": true
        }
        ```
        Ensure the JSON is well-formed after adding the entry. Save and close the `projects.json` file.
    4. **Access Project Manager Sidebar:** Open the Activity Bar in VSCode and locate the Project Manager sidebar.
    5. **Find Malicious Project:** Locate the "Malicious Project Reveal Test" in the Project Manager sidebar.
    6. **Trigger "Reveal in OS" Command:** Right-click on "Malicious Project Reveal Test". From the context menu, select "Reveal in Finder" (macOS), "Reveal in Explorer" (Windows), or "Reveal in File Manager" (Linux).
    7. **Verify Vulnerability:** Observe if the operating system's file explorer opens and reveals the content of the `/etc/passwd` file (or the sensitive file you specified). If the sensitive file is revealed, the vulnerability is confirmed.
