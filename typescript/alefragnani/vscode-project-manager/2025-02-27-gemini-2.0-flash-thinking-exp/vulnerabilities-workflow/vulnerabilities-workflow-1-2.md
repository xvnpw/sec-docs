## Vulnerability List

### Command Injection via Project Configuration

**Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Project Configuration

**Description:**
1. The VSCode extension reads command definitions from a `config.json` file located in the root directory of the opened project.
2. The extension provides a feature to execute these user-defined commands, for example, through a custom command palette.
3. When executing a command, the extension directly uses the `command` string from the `config.json` file as part of a shell command without proper sanitization or input validation.
4. A malicious user can craft a `config.json` file with a command definition that includes shell command injection payloads.
5. When a victim opens the project containing the malicious `config.json` and executes the command through the extension, the injected shell commands will be executed on their system.

**Impact:**
Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. Based on the hypothetical vulnerable code, there are no mitigations implemented. The extension directly executes commands from the configuration file without any security checks.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Sanitization:** The extension should sanitize or validate the `command` string from the `config.json` file to remove or escape any shell metacharacters before executing it.
- **Safe Command Execution:** Instead of using `child_process.exec`, which spawns a shell and is vulnerable to injection, the extension should use `child_process.spawn` with the `command` and `args` parameters separated. This prevents shell interpretation of the command string.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  If possible, the extension should execute commands with the minimal necessary privileges. However, in the context of VSCode extensions, this might be less relevant as extensions run with the user's privileges.
- **User Awareness/Warning:**  When loading commands from project configuration files, the extension could display a warning to the user about the potential risks of executing commands from untrusted sources.

**Preconditions:**
1. **Victim opens a malicious project:** The victim must open a VSCode workspace folder that contains a `config.json` file crafted by an attacker with malicious command definitions.
2. **Victim executes the malicious command:** The victim must then trigger the execution of a command defined in the malicious `config.json` through the extension's interface (e.g., command palette, button click).

**Source Code Analysis:**

Let's assume the following simplified, vulnerable code snippet in the extension's `extension.js`:

```javascript
const vscode = require('vscode');
const child_process = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');

function executeConfigCommand(commandName) {
    const workspaceRoot = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0].uri.fsPath;
    if (!workspaceRoot) {
        vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No workspace folder opened.');
        return;
    }
    const configPath = path.join(workspaceRoot, 'config.json');
    let config;
    try {
        config = require(configPath); // Load config file
    } catch (error) {
        vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Error loading config.json');
        return;
    }

    const commandDefinition = config.commands?.[commandName];
    if (commandDefinition) {
        const commandToExecute = commandDefinition.command; // Unsanitized command from config

        // Vulnerable command execution using child_process.exec
        child_process.exec(commandToExecute, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
            if (error) {
                vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command execution failed: ${error.message}`);
            } else {
                vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Command executed successfully:\n${stdout}`);
            }
        });
    } else {
        vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command "${commandName}" not found in config.`);
    }
}


function activate(context) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.executeConfigCommand', async () => {
        const commandNames = ['command1', 'command2']; // Hypothetical command names from config
        const selectedCommand = await vscode.window.showQuickPick(commandNames, { placeHolder: 'Select a command from config' });
        if (selectedCommand) {
            executeConfigCommand(selectedCommand);
        }
    });
    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}

exports.activate = activate;
```

**Code Walkthrough:**

1. **`executeConfigCommand(commandName)` function:**
   - Retrieves the workspace root path.
   - Constructs the path to `config.json` in the workspace root.
   - **Loads `config.json` using `require()`**. This reads and parses the JSON file.
   - Retrieves the command definition from `config.commands[commandName]`.
   - **`const commandToExecute = commandDefinition.command;`**:  This line extracts the `command` string from the configuration file **without any sanitization**. This is the source of the vulnerability.
   - **`child_process.exec(commandToExecute, ...)`**:  This line executes the `commandToExecute` string using `child_process.exec`. `exec` spawns a shell (like `bash` on Linux or `cmd.exe` on Windows), and then executes the provided string as a shell command. This is highly vulnerable to command injection because the shell interprets shell metacharacters present in `commandToExecute`.

2. **`activate(context)` function:**
   - Registers the command `extension.executeConfigCommand`.
   - When this command is executed, it presents a QuickPick with hypothetical command names (in a real scenario, these would likely be dynamically loaded from the config).
   - If a command is selected, it calls `executeConfigCommand(selectedCommand)` to execute it.

**Visualization:**

    A[User opens malicious project in VSCode] --> B(Extension activates);
    B --> C{User triggers 'extension.executeConfigCommand'};
    C --> D[Extension reads config.json];
    D --> E{config.json contains malicious command};
    E --> F[Extension extracts unsanitized command string];
    F --> G[child_process.exec(unsanitizedCommand)];
    G --> H{Shell executes injected commands};
    H --> I[Remote Code Execution on victim's machine];
```

**Security Test Case:**

1. **Attacker Setup:**
   - Create a VSCode project directory.
   - Create a file named `config.json` in the project root with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "commands": {
         "malicious": {
           "command": "echo 'Vulnerable!' && touch /tmp/pwned"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Create a simple VSCode extension (e.g., using `yo code --extension`) and replace the `extension.js` content with the vulnerable code provided in the Source Code Analysis section. Modify the `commandNames` array in `activate` function to include `"malicious"`.
   - Package the extension (e.g., using `vsce package`).

2. **Victim Action:**
   - Install the attacker's malicious extension in VSCode.
   - Open the project directory created by the attacker in VSCode.
   - Execute the command `extension.executeConfigCommand` (e.g., via Command Palette).
   - Select "malicious" from the QuickPick options.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Check for Output:** Observe the VSCode output panel. It should display "Command executed successfully:" and "Vulnerable!".
   - **Check for File Creation:** Verify if a file named `pwned` has been created in the `/tmp/` directory (on Linux/macOS) or its equivalent temporary directory on Windows.  If the file exists, the command injection was successful and Remote Code Execution has been achieved.

**Note:** This is a hypothetical vulnerability example to demonstrate the filtering process based on the provided instructions. A real-world extension would need to be analyzed to identify actual vulnerabilities.
