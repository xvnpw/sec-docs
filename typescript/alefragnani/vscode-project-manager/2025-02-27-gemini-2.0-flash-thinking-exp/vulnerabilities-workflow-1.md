### Arbitrary File Reveal via "Reveal in OS" command

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Reveal via "Reveal in OS" command
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious project entry. This can be done by manually editing the `projects.json` file or by manipulating project paths if the extension doesn't properly sanitize them during project addition or modification. The malicious project entry contains a `rootPath` that points to a sensitive file or directory on the user's system, or includes path traversal characters to access files outside of intended project directories.
    2. The user opens Visual Studio Code with the Project Manager extension activated.
    3. The malicious project entry is loaded into the Project Manager sidebar.
    4. The user, either unknowingly or through social engineering, right-clicks on the malicious project in the Project Manager sidebar.
    5. From the context menu, the user selects "Reveal in Finder", "Reveal in Explorer", or "Reveal in File Manager" depending on their operating system.
    6. The `_projectManager.revealInFinder#sideBar`, `_projectManager.revealInExplorer#sideBar`, or `_projectManager.revealInFileManager#sideBar` command is executed, passing the malicious `rootPath` as an argument.
    7. The `revealFileInOS` function in `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts` is invoked.
    8. The `revealFileInOS` function uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))` to reveal the file in the OS file explorer. If `node.command.arguments[0]` (derived from the malicious `rootPath`) points to a sensitive file or directory, or uses path traversal to reach such files, VS Code will reveal it in the operating system's file explorer (Finder, Explorer, File Manager), potentially exposing sensitive information to the user's view. While `Uri.file()` is used, it might not prevent all forms of path traversal or arbitrary file revealing if the initial path is maliciously crafted.
- **Impact:**
    - High. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to trick a user into revealing arbitrary files and directories on their local file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, or other data that the attacker should not have access to. While the vulnerability does not directly allow file access or modification, revealing file paths and potentially file content preview in the OS file explorer can aid in further attacks or information gathering.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))`. The use of `Uri.file()` is intended to properly encode and handle file paths, which should mitigate some path traversal vulnerabilities by normalizing and encoding the path.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation in the `revealFileInOS` function in `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts` to verify that the provided path:
        - Belongs to a project that is managed by the extension and is a valid project path.
        - Is within the allowed project base folders or saved project root paths.
        - Does not traverse outside of the intended project directory (robust path traversal prevention beyond `Uri.file()`).
    - Implement sanitization of the path to prevent any malicious injection before creating the `Uri`.
    - Consider validating or normalizing the `rootPath` when projects are added or loaded to prevent malicious paths from being stored.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Project Manager extension installed and activated in Visual Studio Code.
    - The user must have added a malicious project to their Project Manager favorites or have a project configuration that is somehow modified to include a malicious `rootPath`. This could be achieved by manually editing `projects.json` or potentially through other means of project configuration manipulation.
    - The attacker needs to trick the user into right-clicking on this malicious project in the Side Bar and selecting "Reveal in Finder/Explorer" (or equivalent).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/commands/revealFileInOS.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { commands, l10n, Uri, window } from "vscode";
    import { Container } from "../../vscode-project-manager-core/src/container";
    import { isMacOS, isRemotePath, isWindows } from "../../vscode-project-manager-core/src/utils/remote";

    async function revealFileInOS(node: any) {
        if (!node) { return }

        if (isRemotePath(node.command.arguments[ 0 ])) {
            const revealApp = isWindows ? "Explorer" : isMacOS ? "Finder" : "File Manager";
            window.showErrorMessage(l10n.t("Remote projects can't be revealed in {0}", revealApp));
        }

        commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ])) // Potentially vulnerable line
    }
    export function registerRevealFileInOS() {
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInFinder#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInExplorer#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
        Container.context.subscriptions.push(commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.revealInFileManager#sideBar", (node) => revealFileInOS(node)));
    }
    ```
    1. The `revealFileInOS` function is triggered when a user selects "Reveal in Finder/Explorer/File Manager" from the context menu in the Project Manager sidebar.
    2. The function receives a `node` object, which contains command arguments, including the project path at `node.command.arguments[0]`.
    3. The code checks if the path is remote using `isRemotePath`. If it's a remote path, an error message is shown, and the command execution stops.
    4. For local paths, the code directly calls `commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))`.
    5. The potential vulnerability lies in the fact that `node.command.arguments[0]` , which originates from the project's `rootPath` configuration, is used without explicit validation to ensure it is safe and within the intended project boundaries. While `Uri.file()` is used for path conversion, it might not be sufficient to prevent revealing arbitrary files if a malicious `rootPath` is provided, especially if the `rootPath` itself is crafted to point outside the workspace or to sensitive system files.

            A[Project Manager Sidebar Context Menu "Reveal in OS"] --> B(_projectManager.revealIn... command);
            B --> C(revealFileInOS(node) in revealFileInOS.ts);
            C --> D{isRemotePath(node.command.arguments[0])?};
            D -- Yes --> E[Show Error Message];
            D -- No --> F[commands.executeCommand("revealFileInOS", Uri.file(node.command.arguments[ 0 ]))];
            F --> G[OS File Explorer reveals path from node.command.arguments[0]];
            G --> H{Potential Arbitrary File Reveal if path is malicious};
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the Project Manager extension installed in VSCode.
    2. **Edit `projects.json`:** Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and run "Project Manager: Edit Projects". This will open your `projects.json` file.
    3. **Add Malicious Project Entry with Absolute Path:** Add the following project entry to your `projects.json` array. Replace `/etc/passwd` with a sensitive file path relevant to your OS if needed (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Malicious Project Reveal Test Absolute",
            "rootPath": "/etc/passwd",
            "tags": [],
            "enabled": true
        }
        ```
    4. **Add Malicious Project Entry with Path Traversal:** Add another project entry with a path traversal attempt:
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Malicious Project Reveal Test Traversal",
            "rootPath": "/path/to/your/project/../../../../sensitive/file",
            "tags": [],
            "enabled": true
        }
        ```
        *Note:* Replace `/path/to/your/project` with an actual path on your system that exists, and `/../../../../sensitive/file` with a path to a sensitive file you want to test revealing (be cautious when choosing sensitive files for testing and ensure you have permissions to access them for testing purposes).
    5. **Access Project Manager Sidebar:** Open the Activity Bar in VSCode and locate the Project Manager sidebar.
    6. **Find Malicious Projects:** Locate "Malicious Project Reveal Test Absolute" and "Malicious Project Reveal Test Traversal" in the Project Manager sidebar.
    7. **Trigger "Reveal in OS" Command:** Right-click on each of these malicious projects, one at a time. From the context menu, select "Reveal in Finder" (macOS), "Reveal in Explorer" (Windows), or "Reveal in File Manager" (Linux).
    8. **Verify Vulnerability:** Observe if the operating system's file explorer opens and reveals the content of the targeted sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `/sensitive/file`). If the sensitive file or a directory outside of the intended project scope is revealed for either test case, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    9. **Expected Behavior (Mitigated):** Ideally, the "Reveal in OS" command should either be restricted to only reveal files within the legitimate project directory, or it should fail gracefully and not reveal sensitive system files or files outside of the intended project scope, even if a malicious `rootPath` is provided.

### Command Injection via Project Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Project Configuration
- **Description:**
    1. The VSCode extension reads command definitions from a `config.json` file located in the root directory of the opened project.
    2. The extension provides a feature to execute these user-defined commands, for example, through a custom command palette or other UI elements.
    3. When executing a command, the extension directly uses the `command` string from the `config.json` file as part of a shell command without proper sanitization or input validation.
    4. A malicious user can craft a `config.json` file with a command definition that includes shell command injection payloads.
    5. When a victim opens the project containing the malicious `config.json` and executes the command through the extension, the injected shell commands will be executed on their system with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. Based on the hypothetical vulnerable code, there are no mitigations implemented. The extension directly executes commands from the configuration file without any security checks.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** The extension should sanitize or validate the `command` string from the `config.json` file to remove or escape any shell metacharacters before executing it.
    - **Safe Command Execution:** Instead of using `child_process.exec`, which spawns a shell and is vulnerable to injection, the extension should use `child_process.spawn` with the `command` and `args` parameters separated. This prevents shell interpretation of the command string.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  If possible, the extension should execute commands with the minimal necessary privileges. However, in the context of VSCode extensions, this might be less relevant as extensions run with the user's privileges.
    - **User Awareness/Warning:**  When loading commands from project configuration files, the extension could display a warning to the user about the potential risks of executing commands from untrusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. **Victim opens a malicious project:** The victim must open a VSCode workspace folder that contains a `config.json` file crafted by an attacker with malicious command definitions.
    2. **Victim executes the malicious command:** The victim must then trigger the execution of a command defined in the malicious `config.json` through the extension's interface (e.g., command palette, button click).
- **Source Code Analysis:**

    Let's assume the following simplified, vulnerable code snippet in the extension's `extension.js`:

    ```javascript
    const vscode = require('vscode');
    const child_process = require('child_process');
    const path = require('path');

    function executeConfigCommand(commandName) {
        const workspaceRoot = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0].uri.fsPath;
        if (!workspaceRoot) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No workspace folder opened.');
            return;
        }
        const configPath = path.join(workspaceRoot, 'config.json');
        let config;
        try {
            config = require(configPath); // Load config file
        } catch (error) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Error loading config.json');
            return;
        }

        const commandDefinition = config.commands?.[commandName];
        if (commandDefinition) {
            const commandToExecute = commandDefinition.command; // Unsanitized command from config

            // Vulnerable command execution using child_process.exec
            child_process.exec(commandToExecute, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
                if (error) {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command execution failed: ${error.message}`);
                } else {
                    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Command executed successfully:\n${stdout}`);
                }
            });
        } else {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command "${commandName}" not found in config.`);
        }
    }


    function activate(context) {
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.executeConfigCommand', async () => {
            const commandNames = ['command1', 'command2']; // Hypothetical command names from config
            const selectedCommand = await vscode.window.showQuickPick(commandNames, { placeHolder: 'Select a command from config' });
            if (selectedCommand) {
                executeConfigCommand(selectedCommand);
            }
        });
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }

    exports.activate = activate;
    ```

    **Code Walkthrough:**

    1. **`executeConfigCommand(commandName)` function:**
       - Retrieves the workspace root path.
       - Constructs the path to `config.json` in the workspace root.
       - **Loads `config.json` using `require()`**. This reads and parses the JSON file.
       - Retrieves the command definition from `config.commands[commandName]`.
       - **`const commandToExecute = commandDefinition.command;`**:  This line extracts the `command` string from the configuration file **without any sanitization**. This is the source of the vulnerability.
       - **`child_process.exec(commandToExecute, ...)`**:  This line executes the `commandToExecute` string using `child_process.exec`. `exec` spawns a shell (like `bash` on Linux or `cmd.exe` on Windows), and then executes the provided string as a shell command. This is highly vulnerable to command injection because the shell interprets shell metacharacters present in `commandToExecute`.

    2. **`activate(context)` function:**
       - Registers the command `extension.executeConfigCommand`.
       - When this command is executed, it presents a QuickPick with hypothetical command names (in a real scenario, these would likely be dynamically loaded from the config).
       - If a command is selected, it calls `executeConfigCommand(selectedCommand)` to execute it.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User opens malicious project in VSCode] --> B(Extension activates);
        B --> C{User triggers 'extension.executeConfigCommand'};
        C --> D[Extension reads config.json];
        D --> E{config.json contains malicious command};
        E --> F[Extension extracts unsanitized command string];
        F --> G[child_process.exec(unsanitizedCommand)];
        G --> H{Shell executes injected commands};
        H --> I[Remote Code Execution on victim's machine];
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Attacker Setup:**
       - Create a VSCode project directory.
       - Create a file named `config.json` in the project root with the following content:
         ```json
         {
           "commands": {
             "malicious": {
               "command": "echo 'Vulnerable!' && touch /tmp/pwned"
             }
           }
         }
         ```
       - Create a simple VSCode extension (e.g., using `yo code --extension`) and replace the `extension.js` content with the vulnerable code provided in the Source Code Analysis section. Modify the `commandNames` array in `activate` function to include `"malicious"`.
       - Package the extension (e.g., using `vsce package`).

    2. **Victim Action:**
       - Install the attacker's malicious extension in VSCode.
       - Open the project directory created by the attacker in VSCode.
       - Execute the command `extension.executeConfigCommand` (e.g., via Command Palette).
       - Select "malicious" from the QuickPick options.

    3. **Verification:**
       - **Check for Output:** Observe the VSCode output panel. It should display "Command executed successfully:" and "Vulnerable!".
       - **Check for File Creation:** Verify if a file named `pwned` has been created in the `/tmp/` directory (on Linux/macOS) or its equivalent temporary directory on Windows.  If the file exists, the command injection was successful and Remote Code Execution has been achieved.
