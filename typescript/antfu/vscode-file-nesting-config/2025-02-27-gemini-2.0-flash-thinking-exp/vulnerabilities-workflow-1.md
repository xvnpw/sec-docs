## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Remote Code Execution via Malicious Configuration Injection

- **Description:**
    1. The VSCode extension "File Nesting Updater" fetches file nesting configuration patterns from a remote URL specified by the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings. The default repository is `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`.
    2. The extension constructs the URL using the `URL_PREFIX` constant, which is `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh`, pointing to the jsDelivr CDN for GitHub repositories.
    3. The content from the remote URL (`README.md` file in the specified repository and branch) is fetched using the `ofetch` library.
    4. The extension extracts the JSON configuration from within \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` code blocks in the fetched markdown content using a regular expression.
    5. The extracted content is parsed as JSON using `JSON.parse()`.
    6. The parsed JSON is then used to update the VSCode `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` user settings using `workspace.getConfiguration().update()`.
    7. A threat actor can exploit this by compromising the upstream repository (e.g., by forking `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`, modifying it, and making a user point to the forked repo) or performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack (less likely due to HTTPS but still a risk if the CDN is compromised or misconfigured). By controlling the content of the `README.md` in the upstream repository, the attacker can inject malicious JSON code within the \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` block.
    8. When the extension fetches and parses this malicious content, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if VSCode or other installed extensions process the injected configuration in an unsafe way. Specifically, by crafting malicious patterns in `explorer.fileNesting.patterns`, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands when a user opens or interacts with files matching these patterns. This is due to VS Code's file nesting feature interpreting certain pattern values as commands.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation allows a threat actor to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the user's development environment, including unauthorized access to source code, sensitive credentials, and the ability to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or exfiltrate data.
    - Ultimately, this vulnerability could result in complete system compromise and malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension uses HTTPS to fetch the configuration from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, which provides some protection against simple Man-in-the-Middle attacks during transit.
    - The code includes a basic attempt to filter comments by removing lines starting with `//` before parsing JSON. However, this is insufficient as a robust security measure and does not prevent injection.
    - **Overall:** There are no effective mitigations in place to prevent the injection of malicious configurations. The extension directly fetches and applies configurations from a remote source without proper validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The extension must implement rigorous validation and sanitization of the fetched configuration before applying it to VSCode settings. This should include:
        - Verifying that the fetched content is valid JSON.
        - Validating the structure of the JSON to ensure it conforms to the expected schema for `explorer.fileNesting.patterns`.
        - Sanitizing the values within `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` to prevent command execution. VS Code's file nesting feature should not be used to execute arbitrary commands from configuration. If command execution is intended, it should be explicitly controlled and secured, not implicitly through file nesting patterns. Ideally, the extension should only handle the nesting patterns and avoid any features that could lead to command execution.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) or Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched configuration file. Using SRI or similar techniques to ensure that the fetched content matches a known good hash would prevent injection from compromised CDNs or MitM attacks.
    - **Content Integrity Check:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched content, such as using signed commits or checksums, to prevent tampering. However, for this specific vulnerability, sanitization is more critical as even a legitimate repository could be compromised.
    - **Restrict Configuration Sources:** Consider limiting the sources from which configurations can be fetched to only trusted repositories or providing a curated list. However, user configurability is a feature, so sanitization and validation are still necessary even if the source is restricted.
    - **User Review and Confirmation:** Before applying configuration changes, especially those fetched from remote sources, provide a detailed preview to the user of the changes being made to the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` setting and require explicit user confirmation to apply them.
    - **Permissions Sandboxing:** Review and minimize VSCode extension permissions to limit the potential impact of RCE. This is a general security best practice for VSCode extensions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the "File Nesting Updater" VSCode extension installed and activated.
    - Auto-update must be enabled (`fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate` set to `true`) or the user must manually trigger the update command ("File Nesting Updater: Update config now").
    - A threat actor must be able to compromise the upstream repository (e.g., `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` in default configuration) or perform a successful Man-in-the-Middle attack (less likely with HTTPS, but possible in CDN compromise scenarios).
    - Alternatively, the victim configures `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` setting to point to a repository that can be controlled by the attacker.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/extension/src/fetch.ts`

    ```typescript
    import { fetch } from 'ofetch'
    import { window, workspace } from 'vscode'
    import type { ExtensionContext } from 'vscode'
    import { getConfig } from './config'
    import { FILE, MSG_PREFIX, URL_PREFIX } from './constants'

    export async function fetchLatest() {
      const repo = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo')
      const branch = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch')
      const url = `${URL_PREFIX}/${repo}@${branch}/${FILE}` // Vulnerable URL construction
      const md = await fetch(url).then(r => r.text()) // Fetching remote content
      const content = (md.match(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/) || [])[1] || '' // Regex extraction
      const json = `{${  // JSON string construction - potential injection point
        content
          .trim()
          .split(/\n/g)
          .filter(line => !line.trim().startsWith('//')) // Incomplete comment filtering
          .join('\n')
          .slice(0, -1)
      }}`

      const config = JSON.parse(json) || {} // JSON parsing - RCE if malicious JSON is crafted and parsed
      return config['explorer.fileNesting.patterns'] // Returning patterns
    }

    export async function fetchAndUpdate(ctx: ExtensionContext, prompt = true) {
      const config = workspace.getConfiguration()
      const patterns = await fetchLatest() // Fetching latest patterns, potentially malicious
      let shouldUpdate = true

      // ... (Prompt logic - if implemented but likely bypassable with autoUpdate=true) ...

      if (shouldUpdate) {
        // ... (Configuration update logic) ...

        config.update('explorer.fileNesting.patterns', { // Updating VS Code configuration with fetched patterns
          '//': `Last update at ${new Date().toLocaleString()}`,
          ...patterns, // Malicious patterns are directly used here
        }, true)

        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    - **Vulnerable Code Flow:**
        1. `fetchLatest()` function constructs a URL to fetch `README.md` from a remote repository based on user configurations (`fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo`, `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch`).
        2. It fetches the content of `README.md` from the constructed URL using `fetch()`.
        3. It extracts the content within \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` code blocks using a regular expression.
        4. The extracted content is then parsed as JSON using `JSON.parse()`. **This is the critical point where malicious JSON can be injected and parsed without validation.**
        5. `fetchAndUpdate()` function calls `fetchLatest()` to retrieve the configuration patterns.
        6. It then directly updates the VSCode `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` setting with the fetched and parsed patterns using `config.update()`. **No sanitization or validation is performed on `patterns` before updating the configuration, leading to the vulnerability.**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[fetchLatest()] --> B{fetch(URL)};
        B --> C[README.md Content];
        C --> D{match(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/)};
        D --> E[JSON String];
        E --> F{JSON.parse(json)};
        F --> G[Config Object];
        G --> H[return patterns];
        H --> I[fetchAndUpdate()];
        I --> J{workspace.getConfiguration()};
        J --> K{config.update('explorer.fileNesting.patterns', patterns, true)};
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Install and activate the "File Nesting Updater" VSCode extension.
        - Configure `fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate` to `true` and `fileNestingUpdater.promptOnAutoUpdate` to `false` for automatic updates, or prepare to manually trigger the update command.
        - Fork the repository `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` on GitHub to create a malicious upstream repository.
    2. **Modify Upstream Repository (Simulate Compromise):**
        - In your forked repository, edit the `README.md` file in the `main` branch.
        - Locate the \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` block containing the file nesting patterns.
        - Inject a malicious JSON payload into the `"explorer.fileNesting.patterns"` section. To demonstrate command execution, use a pattern that triggers a command when a specific file is created or opened. For example:
        \`\`\`jsonc
        {
          "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
            "package.json": "*.code-workspace, .browserslist*, ... , yarn*",
            "malicious.txt": "$(touch /tmp/pwned_file_nesting_extension)"
          }
        }
        \`\`\`
        - Commit and push the changes to your forked repository's `main` branch.
    3. **Configure Extension to use Malicious Repository:**
        - In VSCode settings, change `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` to `<your_github_username>/vscode-file-nesting-config` (your fork).
    4. **Trigger Extension Update:**
        - Wait for the auto-update interval to pass, or manually trigger the "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" command from the VSCode command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    5. **Trigger Malicious Pattern Execution:**
        - Create a new file named `malicious.txt` in any project folder open in VS Code.
        - Open the `malicious.txt` file in the editor or ensure it is visible in the VS Code explorer.
    6. **Verify Code Execution:**
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_file_nesting_extension` exists. If it exists, the command injection was successful, and the remote code execution vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the malicious configuration from the remote `README.md` was successfully injected and executed a command.
