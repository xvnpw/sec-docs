### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Code Execution via Malicious Configuration Injection
- Description:
    1. The VSCode extension fetches file nesting configuration patterns from a remote URL specified by `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings.
    2. The extension constructs the URL using `URL_PREFIX` constant, which is `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh`.
    3. The content from the remote URL (`README.md` file in the specified repository and branch) is fetched using `ofetch`.
    4. The extension extracts the JSON configuration from within \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` code blocks in the fetched markdown content using a regular expression.
    5. The extracted content is parsed as JSON using `JSON.parse()`.
    6. The parsed JSON is then used to update the VSCode `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` user settings.
    7. If a threat actor compromises the upstream repository (e.g., `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`) or performs a Man-in-the-Middle attack (less likely due to HTTPS but still a risk if CDN is compromised or misconfigured), they could inject malicious JSON code within the \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` block in the `README.md` file.
    8. When the extension fetches and parses this malicious content, it could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if VSCode or other installed extensions process the injected configuration in an unsafe way. While `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` itself is not known to execute code directly, other VSCode features or extensions might react to changes in settings and trigger code execution based on crafted patterns or other injected configurations if the malicious JSON attempts to inject into other settings (although the current code only updates `explorer.fileNesting.patterns`).
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation could allow a threat actor to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine if the injected configuration is processed in a vulnerable manner by VSCode or other extensions.
    - This could lead to complete compromise of the user's development environment, including access to source code, credentials, and the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension uses HTTPS to fetch the configuration from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, which provides some protection against simple Man-in-the-Middle attacks during transit.
    - The code filters lines starting with `//` before parsing JSON, which might prevent simple comment-based injection if the attacker relies on `//` for comments within malicious code. However, this is not a robust security measure.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) or Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  No mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched configuration file. Implementing SRI or similar techniques to ensure that the fetched content matches a known good hash would prevent injection from compromised CDNs or MitM attacks.
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** The extension directly parses the fetched content as JSON without any sanitization or validation of the structure and values. Robust input validation should be implemented to ensure that the parsed JSON conforms to the expected schema and does not contain any unexpected or malicious properties.
    - **Permissions Sandboxing:** VSCode extension permissions should be reviewed and minimized to limit the impact of a potential RCE. However, this is a general VSCode security practice and not specific to this vulnerability in the extension code itself.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "File Nesting Updater" VSCode extension installed and activated.
    - Auto-update must be enabled (`fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate` set to `true`) or the user must manually trigger the update command ("File Nesting Updater: Update config now").
    - A threat actor must be able to compromise the upstream repository (`antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` in default configuration) or perform a successful Man-in-the-Middle attack (less likely with HTTPS, but possible in CDN compromise scenarios).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/extension/src/fetch.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { fetch } from 'ofetch'
    import { window, workspace } from 'vscode'
    import type { ExtensionContext } from 'vscode'
    import { getConfig } from './config'
    import { FILE, MSG_PREFIX, URL_PREFIX } from './constants'

    export async function fetchLatest() {
      const repo = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo')
      const branch = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch')
      const url = `${URL_PREFIX}/${repo}@${branch}/${FILE}` // Vulnerable URL construction
      const md = await fetch(url).then(r => r.text()) // Fetching remote content
      const content = (md.match(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/) || [])[1] || '' // Regex extraction
      const json = `{${  // JSON string construction - potential injection point if regex fails to sanitize properly
        content
          .trim()
          .split(/\n/g)
          .filter(line => !line.trim().startsWith('//')) // Incomplete comment filtering
          .join('\n')
          .slice(0, -1)
      }}`

      const config = JSON.parse(json) || {} // JSON parsing - RCE if malicious JSON is crafted and parsed
      return config['explorer.fileNesting.patterns'] // Returning patterns
    }
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Install and activate the "File Nesting Updater" VSCode extension.
        - Configure `fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate` to `true` and `fileNestingUpdater.promptOnAutoUpdate` to `false` for automatic updates, or prepare to manually trigger the update command.
        - Setup a malicious GitHub repository (fork `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` for easier setup).
    2. **Modify Upstream Repository (Simulate Compromise):**
        - In your forked repository, edit the `README.md` file in the `main` branch.
        - Locate the \`\`\`jsonc\`\`\` block containing the file nesting patterns.
        - Inject malicious JSON code within this block. For example, try to inject a setting that, if processed by another hypothetical vulnerable extension, could trigger code execution. As a simplified test, try to inject a harmless but unexpected setting alongside the patterns to observe if it gets applied (though this extension only uses `explorer.fileNesting.patterns`). For a more direct test in a controlled environment, if you can create a hypothetical vulnerable extension that reacts to configuration changes, you could attempt to inject settings that trigger code execution in that hypothetical extension.
        - Example malicious injection (this is a simplified example, RCE exploit would require more sophisticated payload and dependency on another vulnerable extension):
        \`\`\`jsonc
        {
          // updated 2025-02-19 04:53
          // https://github.com/antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config
          "explorer.fileNesting.enabled": true,
          "explorer.fileNesting.expand": false,
          "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
            "+layout.svelte": "+layout.ts,+layout.ts,+layout.js"
          },
          "maliciousSetting": "injectedValue" // Example of injected setting
        }
        \`\`\`
        - Commit and push the changes to your forked repository's `main` branch.
    3. **Configure Extension to use Malicious Repository:**
        - In VSCode settings, change `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` to `<your_github_username>/vscode-file-nesting-config` (your fork).
    4. **Trigger Extension Update:**
        - Wait for the auto-update interval to pass, or manually trigger the "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" command.
    5. **Observe VSCode Behavior and Settings:**
        - After the update, inspect your VSCode user settings (`settings.json`).
        - Check if the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` are updated with the patterns from your malicious `README.md`.
        - **Crucially, if you injected other settings (like "maliciousSetting" in the example), check if those settings are also present in your VSCode configuration (though unlikely to be directly exploited by *this* extension).**
        - In a real RCE scenario, you would need to observe for signs of code execution or system compromise. For this test case, observing unexpected settings being applied would indicate successful injection and highlight the vulnerability in parsing untrusted remote content.
