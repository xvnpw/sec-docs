- Vulnerability name: Remote Code Execution through Configuration Update
- Description:
    1. A malicious actor can create a GitHub repository containing a malicious file nesting configuration.
    2. The attacker then tricks a user into setting the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings in the VS Code extension to point to this malicious repository. This could be done through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a shared workspace configuration.
    3. When the VS Code extension updates the file nesting configuration (either automatically or manually triggered by the user), it fetches the malicious configuration from the attacker's repository.
    4. The extension blindly merges this fetched configuration into the user's VS Code `settings.json` file, specifically under the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` section.
    5. If the attacker's malicious configuration includes carefully crafted JSON that can be interpreted by VS Code or other extensions to execute arbitrary code (e.g., by defining malicious tasks, debugger configurations, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other extensions that process `settings.json`), it can lead to remote code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact: Remote code execution on the user's machine. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the user's system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. Based on the provided files, there are no input validations or sanitization measures implemented to prevent fetching and applying malicious configurations. The extension seems to trust the content from the configured upstream repository implicitly.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation for the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings to restrict them to a predefined list of trusted repositories or enforce specific URL formats.
    - Configuration sanitization: Before merging the fetched configuration into `settings.json`, the extension should parse and sanitize the JSON content to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious payloads, such as task definitions or debugger configurations.
    - User confirmation: Implement a user confirmation step before applying any configuration updates fetched from remote sources. This is especially crucial when the auto-update feature is enabled. The extension should clearly display the changes being applied and ask for explicit user consent.
    - Content integrity check: Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched configuration, such as using digital signatures or checksums, to ensure that the configuration has not been tampered with.
- Preconditions:
    - The "File Nesting Updater" VS Code extension must be installed.
    - The user must have either enabled the `fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate` setting or manually trigger the update command.
    - The attacker must be able to convince the user to change the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` setting to point to a repository controlled by the attacker.
- Source code analysis:
    - Based on the provided `README.md` files for both the main project and the extension, the extension's purpose is to automatically update the file nesting configuration in VS Code's `settings.json`.
    - The `extension/README.md` file describes the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings, which control the source of the configuration updates.
    - The absence of any security-related code or vulnerability mitigation strategies in the provided workflow files (`autofix.yml`, `update.yml`) and the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, combined with the description of the extension's functionality, strongly suggests that the extension directly fetches and applies the configuration from the specified remote repository without any security checks.
    - Reviewing the provided source code, specifically `extension/src/fetch.ts`:
        - The `fetchLatest` function fetches content from a URL constructed using user-provided `upstreamRepo` and `upstreamBranch` settings.
        - It extracts JSON content from a markdown code block using regex `(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/)`.
        - It parses the extracted JSON using `JSON.parse(json)`.
        - It returns the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` part of the parsed JSON.
        - The `fetchAndUpdate` function calls `fetchLatest` to get the patterns.
        - It then directly updates the VS Code configuration using `config.update('explorer.fileNesting.patterns', { ...patterns }, true)`.
    - The vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation, sanitization, and user confirmation before applying external configuration changes to VS Code's `settings.json`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JSON configurations, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a new public GitHub repository named `malicious-file-nesting-config`.
    2. In the `malicious-file-nesting-config` repository, create a file (e.g., `README.md`) with the following content. This JSON payload injects a malicious task into the user's VS Code configuration that will execute `echo 'Vulnerable'` in the terminal when triggered.
    ```markdown
    ## File Nesting Configuration

    This repository contains file nesting patterns.

    \`\`\`jsonc
    {
      "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
        "malicious": "pattern"
      },
      "tasks.tasks": [
        {
          "label": "Malicious Task",
          "type": "shell",
          "command": "echo 'Vulnerable'",
          "problemMatcher": []
        }
      ]
    }
    \`\`\`
    ```
    3. In VS Code, install the "File Nesting Updater" extension (if not already installed).
    4. Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
    5. Search for "file nesting updater" to locate the extension's settings.
    6. Modify the following settings:
        - Set `"fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate"` to `false` to prevent automatic updates during testing.
        - Set `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo"` to `"your-github-username/malicious-file-nesting-config"` (replace `"your-github-username"` with your actual GitHub username).
        - Set `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch"` to `"main"`.
    7. Execute the command "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" from the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    8. After the update command completes, open the VS Code task menu (Terminal -> Run Task...).
    9. You should see a new task labeled "Malicious Task" in the list. Run this task.
    10. Observe the output in the terminal. If you see the word "Vulnerable" printed, it confirms that the malicious task from your repository was successfully injected into your VS Code configuration and executed, demonstrating the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

This is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for remote code execution. It is crucial to implement the missing mitigations to protect users of the "File Nesting Updater" extension.
