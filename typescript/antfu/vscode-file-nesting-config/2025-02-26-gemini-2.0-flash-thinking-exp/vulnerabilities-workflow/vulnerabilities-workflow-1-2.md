- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential SSRF via Unsanitized Upstream Repository Configuration

- **Description:**
  - The VS Code extension fetches file nesting configuration data from a remote URL that is built directly from configuration values. In the function `fetchLatest()`, the extension reads user (or workspace) configuration keys—specifically,  
    `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo"` and `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch"`—without any validation or sanitization.
  - An attacker who can force a victim’s workspace to use malicious values (for example, through a compromised project settings file or social‐engineering the user into accepting altered configuration) can supply a repository string that is not a standard GitHub repository.
  - When the extension’s update is triggered (manually via the `antfu.file-nesting.manualUpdate` command or automatically based on the auto-update interval), the function constructs a URL using template literals:
    ```
    const url = `${URL_PREFIX}/${repo}@${branch}/${FILE}`
    ```
    If—for example—the attacker sets  
    `upstreamRepo = "127.0.0.1:8000/malicious"` and `upstreamBranch = "main"`, then the resulting URL becomes:  
    `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/127.0.0.1:8000/malicious@main/README.md`.
  - The extension then issues a network request to that URL (via the `ofetch` library) and later consumes the returned data. As a result, the extension may be induced to request arbitrary resources—including those internal to the victim’s network—if the attacker can control the configuration values.

- **Impact:**
  - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The victim’s VS Code client (running the extension) will issue HTTP(S) requests to URLs controlled by the attacker. In corporate or restricted network environments, this may allow an attacker to probe or access internal services that would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside.
  - **Data Exposure:** Malicious responses from an attacker–controlled endpoint might alter the local file nesting configuration (or even later trigger behavior in VS Code if the format is specially crafted) and could be used to gather information about the internal network.
  - Although the extension does not execute dynamic code from the fetched resource, the ability to cause arbitrary outbound requests from a client inside a protected network constitutes a high‐severity risk.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - There is currently no sanitization or validation in place for the values returned by `getConfig()` for `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo"` or for `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch"`.
  - The URL is constructed by simply interpolating these settings into a fixed URL prefix (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh`), so any mitigation would have to be implemented within the extension code itself (or via limitations in the VS Code settings management).

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Input Validation:** There is no check that the user-specified repository name conforms to a safe, well-defined format (for example, a regex such as `/^[\w-]+\/[\w.-]+$/` to enforce a GitHub "owner/repo" pattern).
  - **Whitelist Enforcement:** No mechanism is provided to restrict the upstream repository or branch to known safe values.
  - **Error Handling/Logging:** The extension does not log or throw an alert if the fetched URL does not match an expected pattern.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attack requires that the attacker be able to influence or supply configuration values for the keys:
    - `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo`
    - `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch`
  - This may happen if:
    - The workspace settings or user settings are prepopulated by a project file (for example, via version-controlled settings) that the attacker can modify (for instance, through a pull request or commit to a public repository).
    - The victim is socially engineered into installing a workspace with a malicious configuration.
  - The victim’s machine must be configured to allow the extension to perform outbound HTTPS requests (which is the normal behavior).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `fetchLatest()` (located in `/code/extension/src/fetch.ts`):
    - The extension calls:
      ```js
      const repo = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo')
      const branch = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch')
      ```
      These values come directly from the workspace configuration without any checks.
    - The URL is built via:
      ```js
      const url = `${URL_PREFIX}/${repo}@${branch}/${FILE}`
      ```
      Given that `URL_PREFIX` is a constant (`'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh'`) and `FILE` is `'README.md'`, the entire URL depends solely on the values of `repo` and `branch`.
    - Because the values are used “as is”, an attacker can supply values that cause the extension to initiate requests to unintended endpoints.
    - A simple diagram of the flow:
      - **User Settings/Workspace Config:**  
        `upstreamRepo` → *controlled malicious value*  
        `upstreamBranch` → *controlled (or default) value*
      - **Inside `fetchLatest()`:**  
        Construct URL:  
        `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<maliciousRepo>@<branch>/README.md`
      - **Fetch Action:** The extension calls `fetch(url)` and processes the resulting text.
  - No sanitization step or validation function is applied between reading the configuration values and using them in the URL.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** In a controlled test environment (using a test instance of VS Code), install the extension.
  2. **Configuration Change:** Manually update the VS Code settings (either the user or workspace configuration) to set:
     - `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo": "127.0.0.1:8000/malicious"`
     - `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch": "main"`
  3. **Trigger Update:** Execute the command `antfu.file-nesting.manualUpdate` from the command palette.
  4. **Observation:** Using network monitoring tools (or by logging in the test harness), observe that the extension makes an HTTP request to:
     ```
     https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/127.0.0.1:8000/malicious@main/README.md
     ```
     instead of a properly formatted GitHub repository URL.
  5. **Verification:** Confirm that no validation error was raised and that the extension processes (or attempts to process) content returned by this malicious endpoint.
  6. **Conclusion:** Demonstrate that unsanitized configuration values can be exploited to force the extension to perform unintended network requests (SSRF).

Implementing proper input validation (or enforcing a whitelist of acceptable repository names) would mitigate this issue.
