Okay, I understand. You've provided three lists of vulnerabilities, and all of them indicate that no vulnerabilities were found.  My task is to combine these into a single markdown output, formatted as you've described, even though there are no vulnerabilities to list.

Here's the combined output in markdown format, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities and adhering to your requested structure:

```markdown
