Based on the provided information and applying the specified filters for external attacker threats targeting a VS Code extension, and considering the project "Anthony's VS Code Settings" which consists of configuration files rather than an active VS Code extension, there are no high-severity vulnerabilities that meet the inclusion criteria.

The initial analysis correctly points out that the described potential risks are low-severity and not direct vulnerabilities of the project itself. They are more related to supply chain or social engineering issues, which are explicitly excluded by the prompt's focus on direct, high-severity vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker targeting the VS Code extension itself (which this project is not).

Therefore, after applying all the filters:

* **Severity filter:**  The identified potential risks are low-severity, not high or critical.
* **Type of project:** This is a configuration project, not a VS Code extension with executable code.
* **Exclusion filters:**
    * Insecure code patterns in project files: Not applicable, no project code to execute.
    * Missing documentation: Not applicable.
    * Denial of service: Not applicable.
* **Inclusion filters:**
    * Valid and not mitigated:  The low-severity risks are valid in a broader sense, but not direct vulnerabilities of *this project*.
    * Vulnerability rank at least high: The risks are ranked as low-severity.

**Conclusion:**

No vulnerabilities in "Anthony's VS Code Settings" project meet the criteria for inclusion in the vulnerability list based on the provided instructions. This project, being a configuration repository and not a VS Code extension with executable code, does not present high-severity vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in the context described.

Therefore, there are no vulnerabilities to list in markdown format according to the request.
