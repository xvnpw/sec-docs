## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files (VS Code configuration files and a README.md), no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria for inclusion have been identified.

**Explanation:**

The provided files are primarily development environment configurations and documentation. They do not represent application code that would be directly exposed in a publicly accessible instance and vulnerable to external attackers.

Specifically:

*   **VS Code configuration files (`.vscode/settings.json`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `.vscode/global.code-snippets`)**: These files configure the VS Code editor for development purposes. They are not part of the deployed application and are not accessible to external users. They cannot introduce vulnerabilities in a publicly facing application instance.
*   **README.md**: This file is documentation for the project. While documentation can sometimes *describe* vulnerabilities, the absence of documentation about mitigation is explicitly excluded by the instructions. The README file itself does not contain exploitable code or configuration relevant to a deployed application's security.

**Therefore, according to the instructions to exclude vulnerabilities not applicable to a publicly available instance and include only high-rank vulnerabilities, there are no vulnerabilities to list based solely on the provided files.**

**To identify vulnerabilities according to the instructions, application code and details about the deployed application's architecture would be required.**  Without application code, it's impossible to perform source code analysis or security testing relevant to external attackers exploiting a public instance.

**In summary, based on the provided files, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria exist.**
