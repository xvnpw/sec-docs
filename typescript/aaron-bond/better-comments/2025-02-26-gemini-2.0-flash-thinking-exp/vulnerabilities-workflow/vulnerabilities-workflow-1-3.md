### Vulnerability List for Better Comments VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Regular Expression Injection in Custom Tags

* Description:
    1. The Better Comments extension allows users to define custom tags to style comments based on keywords. These tags are configured through the `"better-comments.tags"` setting in VSCode settings.
    2. The extension constructs regular expressions dynamically by incorporating these user-defined tags to identify and style comments.
    3. The tag escaping mechanism implemented in the `setTags` and `SetRegex` methods within `parser.ts` is insufficient to prevent regular expression injection.
    4. A malicious user can inject regex control characters into a custom tag, such as `.*`, `^`, `$`, `|`, `[]`, or `()`.
    5. When the extension processes comments, these injected regex characters are not properly escaped, leading to unintended modifications of the comment matching regular expression.
    6. This can cause the regex to match broader patterns than intended, leading to incorrect or excessive highlighting of code, potentially including non-comment sections.

* Impact:
    - Incorrect comment highlighting: Malicious regex injection can cause the extension to highlight code sections that are not intended to be comments, leading to visual confusion for the user.
    - Potential for further exploitation: While the immediate impact is visual, regex injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks, depending on how the regex engine and the matched results are used. Although in this case, the impact is limited to incorrect highlighting.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension attempts to escape some regex special characters in the `setTags` method in `parser.ts` using the following code:
      ```typescript
      let escapedSequence = item.tag.replace(/([()[{*+.$^\\|?])/g, '\\$1');
      this.tags.push({
          tag: item.tag,
          escapedTag: escapedSequence.replace(/\//gi, "\\/"), // ! hardcoded to escape slashes
          // ...
      });
      ```
    - This escaping mechanism is applied to each custom tag defined in the settings.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Comprehensive Regex Escaping: The current escaping is not sufficient to handle all regex special characters and prevent injection. A more robust regex escaping function should be used to ensure that all special characters in user-provided tags are properly escaped before being incorporated into the regex. Consider using a dedicated regex escaping utility function.
    - Input Validation: The extension should validate user-provided tags in the settings to restrict or escape potentially dangerous characters. This could involve sanitizing the input to remove or escape regex metacharacters before using them in regex construction.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the VSCode user settings or workspace settings where the Better Comments extension's configuration is stored. This can be achieved through social engineering, by tricking a user into importing malicious settings, or by compromising the user's VSCode configuration files.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/parser.ts`
        - Method: `setTags()`
            ```typescript
            private setTags(): void {
                let items = this.contributions.tags;
                for (let item of items) {
                    let options: vscode.DecorationRenderOptions = { color: item.color, backgroundColor: item.backgroundColor };
                    options.textDecoration = "";
                    if (item.strikethrough) {
                        options.textDecoration += "line-through";
                    }
                    if (item.underline) {
                        options.textDecoration += " underline";
                    }
                    if (item.bold) {
                        options.fontWeight = "bold";
                    }
                    if (item.italic) {
                        options.fontStyle = "italic";
                    }

                    let escapedSequence = item.tag.replace(/([()[{*+.$^\\|?])/g, '\\$1');
                    this.tags.push({
                        tag: item.tag,
                        escapedTag: escapedSequence.replace(/\//gi, "\\/"), // ! hardcoded to escape slashes
                        ranges: [],
                        decoration: vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType(options)
                    });
                }
            }
            ```
            - In this method, the `escapedSequence` is created by attempting to escape regex special characters in the user-defined tag. However, the regex `([()[{*+.$^\\|?])` used for escaping is not comprehensive and might miss certain regex metacharacters or edge cases. The second `replace(/\//gi, "\\/")` is specifically for escaping forward slashes, indicating an ad-hoc approach rather than a robust escaping strategy.
        - Method: `SetRegex(languageCode: string)`
            ```typescript
            public async SetRegex(languageCode: string) {
                await this.setDelimiter(languageCode);

                if (!this.supportedLanguage) {
                    return;
                }

                let characters: Array<string> = [];
                for (let commentTag of this.tags) {
                    characters.push(commentTag.escapedTag);
                }

                if (this.isPlainText && this.contributions.highlightPlainText) {
                    this.expression = "(^)+([ \\t]*[ \\t]*)";
                } else {
                    this.expression = "(" + this.delimiter + ")+( |\t)*";
                }

                this.expression += "(";
                this.expression += characters.join("|");
                this.expression += ")+(.*)";
            }
            ```
            - In `SetRegex`, the `escapedTag` from each `CommentTag` is used to build the regular expression. The `characters.join("|")` part concatenates all escaped tags with the `|` (OR) operator. If a malicious tag like `.*` is injected and not properly escaped, it will be included in the regex, potentially altering its behavior to match any character sequence, leading to unintended highlighting.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Install the "Better Comments" extension in VSCode if it is not already installed.
    2. Open VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings, or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
    3. Navigate to "Extensions" and then find "Better Comments" extension settings. Alternatively, edit settings.json directly.
    4. Modify the `better-comments.tags` setting to include a malicious tag. For example, add the following tag to the array:
        ```json
        {
            "tag": ".*",
            "color": "#FF0000",
            "strikethrough": false,
            "underline": false,
            "backgroundColor": "transparent",
            "bold": false,
            "italic": false
        }
        ```
    5. Open or create a new Javascript file (or any other language supported by the extension).
    6. Write a single-line comment in the file, starting with the comment delimiter for that language (e.g., `//` for Javascript), followed by the malicious tag `.*` and then some text. For example:
        ```javascript
        // .* This is a test comment
        var x = 1; // This is normal code
        ```
    7. Observe the syntax highlighting in the editor.
    8. **Expected Behavior (Without Vulnerability):** Only the text " This is a test comment" following the `.*` tag within the first comment line should be highlighted in red (as defined by the malicious tag's color). The second comment line and the code line should be highlighted as per the default or other defined styles.
    9. **Vulnerable Behavior (Regex Injection):** If the regex injection is successful, you will observe that the highlighting is not limited to just the intended comment text. Instead, a larger portion of the line, potentially the entire line including the code `var x = 1; // This is normal code` or even subsequent lines, might be incorrectly highlighted in red. This indicates that the `.*` tag was not properly escaped and has caused the regular expression to match more broadly than intended, affecting code outside the intended comment.

This test case demonstrates that by injecting a malicious regex tag, an attacker can manipulate the comment highlighting behavior of the Better Comments extension, confirming the Regular Expression Injection vulnerability.
