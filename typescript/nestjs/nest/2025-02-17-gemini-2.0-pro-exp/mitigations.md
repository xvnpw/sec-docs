# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Scope Management for Dependency Injection](./mitigation_strategies/strict_scope_management_for_dependency_injection.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review all `@Injectable()` decorators:** Examine every service, repository, and other injectable class within your NestJS application.
2.  **Identify Scope:** Determine the appropriate scope for each injectable:
    *   `DEFAULT` (Singleton): Use for stateless services shared across the application.
    *   `TRANSIENT`: Use for services requiring a new instance per injection.
    *   `REQUEST`: Use *only* when tied to a single HTTP request lifecycle. Avoid if possible.
3.  **Explicitly Set Scope:** Add the `scope` option to the `@Injectable()` decorator: `@Injectable({ scope: Scope.DEFAULT })`, `@Injectable({ scope: Scope.TRANSIENT })`, or `@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })`.
4.  **Audit Module Configuration:** Check `providers` arrays in `@Module()` decorators to ensure the intended scope is used.
5.  **Regular Reviews:** Conduct periodic code reviews to maintain consistent scope management.
6.  **Avoid Dynamic Providers When Possible:** Prefer static providers (`useClass`) over dynamic providers (`useFactory`, `useValue`, `useExisting`) to improve predictability. If dynamic providers are necessary, thoroughly validate any inputs.
7. **Module Isolation:** Use the `exports` array in `@Module()` to explicitly control which providers are accessible from outside the module.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents malicious service injection with broader scope, gaining unintended access.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of request-scoped data sharing between requests.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Reduces excessive object creation with misused `REQUEST` scope.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Limits the attack surface for code injection through compromised dependencies by controlling provider scope and visibility.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Data Leakage: Risk moderately reduced.
    *   DoS: Risk slightly reduced.
    *   Code Injection: Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented for core services (e.g., `UserService`, `ProductService`) using `Scope.DEFAULT`.
    *   Implemented for request-specific data handling using `Scope.REQUEST` in a dedicated `RequestContextProvider`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some utility services use the default scope (Singleton) without explicit declaration. Needs review.
    *   No regular audit process for scope management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation with Pipes and `class-validator` (NestJS-Specific Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_with_pipes_and__class-validator___nestjs-specific_usage_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create DTOs:** Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for all incoming request payloads.
2.  **Add `class-validator` Decorators:** Use decorators like `@IsString()`, `@IsInt()`, `@IsEmail()`, etc., on DTO properties.
3.  **Use `ValidationPipe`:** Apply the NestJS-provided `ValidationPipe` to controllers or handler methods.
4.  **Configure `ValidationPipe`:**
    *   `whitelist: true`: Remove non-DTO properties.
    *   `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`: Error on non-whitelisted properties.
    *   `transform: true`: Convert payload to DTO instance.
5.  **Custom Validation (Optional):** Create custom NestJS validation pipes for complex logic.
6.  **Test Validation:** Write unit tests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  Leveraging NestJS's `ValidationPipe` and `class-validator` integration provides a structured way to prevent injection attacks by enforcing type and format constraints.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Validation and transformation can help prevent stored XSS.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected data modification.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Ensures data meets business requirements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   XSS: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Data Tampering: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Business Logic Errors: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ValidationPipe` is globally applied with `whitelist: true`, `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`, and `transform: true`.
    *   DTOs with `class-validator` decorators are used for most API endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some older API endpoints lack DTOs and validation.
    *   No custom validation pipes for complex scenarios.
    *   Incomplete unit tests for validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Authorization with Guards (NestJS-Specific Implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_authorization_with_guards__nestjs-specific_implementation_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Identify roles and associated permissions.
2.  **Create Custom Guards:** Implement custom NestJS guards using `@Injectable()` and the `CanActivate` interface.
3.  **Implement `canActivate()`:**
    *   Retrieve user role from request context (e.g., JWT).
    *   Check if the role has required permissions.
    *   Return `true` (allow) or `false` (deny).
4.  **Apply Guards:** Use `@UseGuards()` on controllers or handler methods.
5.  **Centralized Authorization (Optional):** Consider a dedicated NestJS service for authorization logic.
6.  **Test Guards:** Write unit tests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Broken Access Control (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access using NestJS's guard mechanism.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining higher privileges.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces unauthorized data access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Broken Access Control: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Information Disclosure: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic `RolesGuard` checks for a `role` in the JWT.
    *   `@Roles()` decorator used on some endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not all endpoints have authorization.
    *   `RolesGuard` is simplistic (no fine-grained permissions).
    *   No centralized authorization service.
    *   Limited unit tests for guards.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Exception Filters with Safe Error Handling (NestJS-Specific Approach)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_exception_filters_with_safe_error_handling__nestjs-specific_approach_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create Custom Exception Filter:** Implement a custom NestJS exception filter using `@Catch()` and `ExceptionFilter`.
2.  **Implement `catch()`:**
    *   Log exception details (including stack trace) *securely*.
    *   Determine the appropriate HTTP status code.
    *   Create a *generic* error response (no sensitive info).
    *   Send the generic response.
3.  **Apply Exception Filter:** Use `@UseFilters()` or apply globally.
4.  **Environment-Specific Behavior:** Use `NODE_ENV` for different behavior in development vs. production.
5.  **Test Exception Handling:** Write unit tests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents leaking sensitive information via NestJS's exception handling.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Ensures secure error handling configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Security Misconfiguration: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A global exception filter logs errors and returns a generic 500.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Filter doesn't differentiate exception types.
    *   No environment-specific handling.
    *   Error messages are not user-friendly.
    *   Minimal unit tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Serialization with `@Expose()` (NestJS and `class-transformer`)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_serialization_with__@expose_____nestjs_and__class-transformer__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Properties:** In entities/DTOs, identify properties *not* to be exposed.
2.  **Use `@Expose()`:** Use `class-transformer`'s `@Expose()` on properties *to* be included.
3.  **Avoid `@Exclude()` Alone:** Don't rely solely on `@Exclude()`.
4.  **`groups` Option (Optional):** Use `groups` with `@Expose()` for context-based serialization.
5.  **Disable `enableImplicitConversion`:** Set `enableImplicitConversion: false` in `class-transformer` options (globally).
6.  **Test Serialization:** Write unit tests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure via NestJS's serialization.

    *   Mass Assignment: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `@Expose()` used in some DTOs, inconsistently.
    *   `enableImplicitConversion` is *not* disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `@Expose()` not used universally.
    *   `enableImplicitConversion` needs disabling.
    *   No use of `groups`.
    *   Incomplete serialization tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure WebSocket Handling (NestJS-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_websocket_handling__nestjs-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Authentication:** Implement authentication for WebSocket connections using NestJS guards, similar to HTTP requests.  Consider JWTs or other token-based methods.
2.  **Authorization:** Apply authorization logic using NestJS guards to control access to WebSocket events and data.
3.  **Input Validation:** Validate all messages received over WebSockets using NestJS Pipes, just as you would with HTTP request bodies.  Define DTOs for WebSocket message payloads.
4.  **Secure Connection (WSS):** Ensure your NestJS WebSocket gateway is configured to use the `wss://` protocol for encrypted communication.
5. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Broken Authentication (High Severity):**  Ensures only authenticated clients can connect.
    *   **Broken Access Control (High Severity):**  Controls access to specific WebSocket events and data.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  Input validation prevents injection attacks through WebSocket messages.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):**  WSS encrypts the communication channel.

    *   No rate limiting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure GraphQL Handling (NestJS-Specific with @nestjs/graphql)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_graphql_handling__nestjs-specific_with_@nestjsgraphql_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Query Complexity Analysis:** Use a library like `graphql-cost-analysis` or `graphql-validation-complexity` with your NestJS GraphQL setup. Configure a maximum query cost and reject queries exceeding this limit.
2.  **Depth Limiting:** Use a library like `graphql-depth-limit` to enforce a maximum query depth within your NestJS GraphQL resolvers.
3.  **Introspection Control:** Disable GraphQL introspection in production using the `introspection` option in your `GraphQLModule` configuration. If needed for development, restrict access using NestJS guards.
4.  **Field-Level Authorization:** Implement field-level authorization using NestJS guards or custom resolvers to control access to specific fields in your GraphQL schema.  This integrates directly with NestJS's authorization mechanisms.
5. **Input Validation:** Use NestJS Pipes and `class-validator` with your GraphQL input types (DTOs) to validate incoming data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No query complexity analysis.
    *   No depth limiting.
    *   Introspection is enabled in all environments.
    *   No field-level authorization.
    *   Input validation is not consistently applied to GraphQL input types.
