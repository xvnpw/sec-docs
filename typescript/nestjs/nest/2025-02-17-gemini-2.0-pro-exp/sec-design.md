# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable application framework for building server-side Node.js applications.
*   Offer a modular architecture inspired by Angular, promoting code organization and reusability.
*   Support various application types, including REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices, and WebSockets.
*   Integrate seamlessly with popular libraries and tools within the Node.js ecosystem.
*   Provide excellent developer experience with comprehensive documentation, tooling, and community support.
*   Maintain a high level of performance and efficiency.
*   Ensure the framework itself is secure and promotes secure coding practices.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities within the framework itself could expose applications built with NestJS to attacks.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could lead to developers implementing insecure or inefficient solutions.
*   Lack of compatibility with key libraries or tools could limit the framework's adoption and usefulness.
*   Performance bottlenecks within the framework could impact the scalability of applications.
*   Failure to keep up with the evolving Node.js ecosystem could lead to obsolescence.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or poor developer experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The framework encourages the use of established security best practices through its structure and documentation. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: NestJS provides built-in support for input validation using libraries like class-validator. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: NestJS offers modules and guidance for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, including JWT, Passport, and guards. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: The framework supports various data serialization and deserialization methods, helping to prevent injection vulnerabilities. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: NestJS encourages the use of dependency injection, which can improve testability and reduce the risk of hardcoded secrets. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: Regular updates and security patches are released to address vulnerabilities. (Described in GitHub repository and documentation)
*   security control: Community support and active issue tracking help identify and resolve security concerns. (Described in GitHub repository)
*   security control: NestJS promotes secure coding practices by providing mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions gracefully. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: NestJS supports the use of secure transport protocols like HTTPS. (Described in documentation)
*   security control: NestJS provides mechanisms for implementing rate limiting and other defenses against denial-of-service attacks. (Described in documentation)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Developers may choose to bypass or misconfigure security features, leading to vulnerabilities in their applications.
*   accepted risk: Third-party libraries used within NestJS applications may introduce their own security risks.
*   accepted risk: The framework may not cover all possible attack vectors, and developers must remain vigilant about emerging threats.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust code review process to ensure that security best practices are followed consistently.
*   security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the development pipeline.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security monitoring and logging system.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for various authentication mechanisms, including JWT, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect.
    *   Secure storage of user credentials (e.g., hashing and salting passwords).
    *   Protection against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Fine-grained control over access to resources and functionalities.
    *   Protection against privilege escalation attacks.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validation of all user inputs against predefined schemas or rules.
    *   Protection against common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, command injection).
    *   Sanitization of user inputs to remove potentially harmful characters.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

    Build -- runs --> SAST
    Build -- runs --> SCA
    Build -- produces --> ContainerRegistry
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the source code repository (GitHub).
2.  The commit triggers the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI/CD pipeline initiates the build process.
4.  The build process includes the following steps:
    *   Compilation: The NestJS application code is compiled.
    *   Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are executed.
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): A SAST tool (e.g., SonarQube) analyzes the source code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): An SCA tool (e.g., Snyk) identifies and analyzes open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Containerization: The application is packaged into a Docker container image.
5.  If all tests and security checks pass, the container image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

Security Controls:

*   security control: CI/CD pipeline enforces automated build and testing processes.
*   security control: SAST tool identifies vulnerabilities in the application code.
*   security control: SCA tool identifies vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies.
*   security control: Container image security scanning detects vulnerabilities in the container image.
*   security control: Least privilege principle applied to build agents and service accounts.
*   security control: Build artifacts are digitally signed to ensure integrity.
