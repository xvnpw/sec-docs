# Threat Model Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Threat: [Custom Decorator Authentication Bypass](./threats/custom_decorator_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious request data (headers, cookies) to bypass authentication logic implemented within a custom decorator (e.g., `@CurrentUser`). The attacker might forge a JWT token or manipulate a header that the decorator incorrectly trusts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, impersonation of other users, data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom Decorators (used for authentication/authorization).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use established authentication libraries like `@nestjs/passport` with strategies like JWT, instead of custom decorator logic for authentication.
    *   Rigorously validate *all* input within custom decorators, especially data from the request object.  Do not trust any request data implicitly.
    *   Simplify decorator logic to minimize the attack surface.
    *   Conduct thorough security testing, including fuzzing, of custom decorators.

## Threat: [Insecure `@Res()` Usage](./threats/insecure__@res____usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a controller method that uses `@Res()` to directly manipulate the response object.  The attacker might inject malicious headers or manipulate the response body if the developer bypasses NestJS's built-in response handling and doesn't properly sanitize output.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if response headers are not properly set, HTTP Response Splitting, other injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Controller methods using the `@Res()` decorator.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid `@Res()` whenever possible.  Rely on NestJS's standard response handling (returning data from controllers).
    *   If `@Res()` is *essential*, meticulously sanitize and validate *all* parts of the response, including headers and body, according to security best practices for the specific vulnerability being mitigated (e.g., OWASP guidelines for XSS prevention).

## Threat: [Malicious Pipe Transformation](./threats/malicious_pipe_transformation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that exploits a custom Pipe designed to transform data. The Pipe might have flawed logic that allows the attacker to modify data in unexpected ways before it reaches the controller or service, potentially bypassing validation or introducing malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Data tampering, bypassing of validation checks, potential for injection vulnerabilities depending on how the transformed data is used.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom Pipes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prefer built-in NestJS Pipes (e.g., `ValidationPipe`) for common tasks.
    *   For custom Pipes, prioritize *validation* over *transformation*.  If transformation is necessary, keep it simple and well-defined.
    *   Thoroughly test custom Pipes with a wide range of inputs, including malicious payloads, to ensure they behave as expected and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Global Component Misconfiguration](./threats/global_component_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured global Pipe, Interceptor, Guard, or Exception Filter.  For example, a global Guard might have a logic flaw that allows unauthorized access, or a global Interceptor might log sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Application-wide vulnerability, potentially affecting all routes and resources.  The specific impact depends on the misconfigured component.
*   **Affected Component:** Globally registered Pipes, Interceptors, Guards, or Exception Filters.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the use of global components.  Prefer module-specific or controller-specific components to limit the scope of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly review and test the configuration of *all* global components, paying close attention to security implications.
    *   Use a "deny-by-default" approach for global Guards, ensuring that access is explicitly granted only where needed.

## Threat: [Configuration Secrets Exposure](./threats/configuration_secrets_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive configuration values (database passwords, API keys, etc.) because they were hardcoded in the application code, stored in insecure configuration files, or committed to version control.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of connected services (databases, external APIs), data breaches, complete system takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** Application configuration (using `@nestjs/config` or other methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use environment variables for *all* sensitive configuration values.
    *   Never commit secrets to version control (use `.gitignore` appropriately).
    *   For production environments, use a secure secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Follow best practices for `@nestjs/config`, including using `.env` files appropriately and validating configuration schemas.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Unhandled Asynchronous Exceptions](./threats/denial_of_service_via_unhandled_asynchronous_exceptions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends requests that trigger unhandled exceptions within asynchronous operations (e.g., database queries, external API calls) in providers.  These unhandled exceptions can crash the application or lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Providers (Services, Repositories) with asynchronous operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for *all* asynchronous operations.  Use `try...catch` blocks around asynchronous code and `.catch()` methods on Promises.
    *   Ensure that unhandled exceptions are caught and logged appropriately, and that the application can recover gracefully from errors.

## Threat: [Rate Limiting Bypass](./threats/rate_limiting_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses or avoids rate limiting mechanisms, allowing them to send a large number of requests to the application, potentially overwhelming resources. This could be due to a misconfigured rate limiter or the absence of one.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for brute-force attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**  Middleware, Interceptors (where rate limiting is implemented), or the absence of rate limiting.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting using a well-tested library like `nestjs-rate-limiter`.
    *   Configure rate limits appropriately based on expected traffic patterns and resource constraints.
    *   Consider using different rate limits for different routes or user roles.
    *   Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust as needed.

## Threat: [Guard Logic Bypass](./threats/guard_logic_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses the authorization logic within a Guard.  This might involve manipulating request data, exploiting a flaw in the Guard's logic, or finding a way to circumvent the Guard entirely.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, elevation of privilege.
*   **Affected Component:** Guards (used for authorization).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use established authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., Passport.js, JWT) in conjunction with Guards.
    *   Keep Guard logic as simple and straightforward as possible.
    *   Thoroughly test Guards with a variety of inputs and user roles, including negative test cases.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define granular permissions.
    *   Validate *all* data used within Guards, especially data derived from the request.

## Threat: [`ExecutionContext` Manipulation in Guards/Interceptors](./threats/_executioncontext__manipulation_in_guardsinterceptors.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates request data (e.g., headers) that is then incorrectly used by a Guard or Interceptor when accessing the `ExecutionContext`. The Guard or Interceptor might rely on this manipulated data for authorization decisions, leading to incorrect access control.
* **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, unauthorized access, potential elevation of privilege.
* **Affected Component:** Guards and Interceptors that use the `ExecutionContext`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate *all* data extracted from the `ExecutionContext` before using it for security-critical decisions.
    *   Avoid relying on easily manipulated request data (like headers) for authorization.  Use authenticated user information (e.g., from a JWT payload) instead.
    *   Thoroughly test Guards and Interceptors with manipulated request data to ensure they are resilient to such attacks.
