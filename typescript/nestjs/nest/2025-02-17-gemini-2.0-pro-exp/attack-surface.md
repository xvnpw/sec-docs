# Attack Surface Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Attack Surface: [1. Dynamic Module Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__dynamic_module_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Dynamic modules configured with untrusted input can lead to code injection or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How NestJS Contributes:** NestJS's dynamic module feature provides a powerful mechanism for runtime configuration. This is a *core* NestJS feature, making it a central point of concern. The framework *explicitly supports and encourages* this dynamic configuration, increasing the risk if misused.
    *   **Example:** A database connection string loaded from a request body without validation. An attacker could inject a malicious connection string pointing to their own database.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, denial of service, data exfiltration, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Strictly validate and sanitize *all* input used to configure dynamic modules.  Use a schema validation library (Joi, class-validator).  Prefer configuration from trusted sources (environment variables, configuration files). Implement least privilege principles.

## Attack Surface: [2. Dependency Injection and Provider Scope Misuse](./attack_surfaces/2__dependency_injection_and_provider_scope_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly scoped providers (singleton vs. request) can lead to shared state vulnerabilities.
    *   **How NestJS Contributes:** NestJS's core dependency injection (DI) system is *fundamental* to its architecture. Provider scoping is a *central* concept within NestJS's DI. The framework's design heavily relies on and promotes the use of providers.
    *   **Example:** A singleton service storing user-specific data in a class property without proper synchronization. Multiple requests could overwrite each other's data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, information disclosure, potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use `REQUEST` scope *only* when absolutely necessary. Default to `SINGLETON` and carefully consider shared state implications. Use immutable data structures. Review provider lifecycles.

## Attack Surface: [3. Input Validation Bypass (Pipes and DTOs)](./attack_surfaces/3__input_validation_bypass__pipes_and_dtos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper use or bypassing of NestJS's validation mechanisms (Pipes, DTOs, class-validator) allows malformed data.
    *   **How NestJS Contributes:** NestJS *integrates* Pipes and DTOs as *first-class citizens* for validation. The framework *actively promotes* their use and provides built-in mechanisms. Misuse or circumvention directly impacts NestJS's intended data handling flow.
    *   **Example:** A custom pipe with a flaw allowing XSS payloads, or a developer disabling global validation pipes.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, SQL injection, denial of service, business logic errors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Use built-in validation Pipes (`ValidationPipe`) with class-validator. Validate *all* input at the controller. Test custom Pipes thoroughly. Do *not* disable global validation pipes. Use defense-in-depth.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [4. Guard Bypass (Authorization Failure)](./attack_surfaces/4__guard_bypass__authorization_failure_.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in guard logic or misconfiguration allow unauthorized access.
    *   **How NestJS Contributes:** NestJS provides Guards as its *primary, built-in* mechanism for authorization. The framework's security model *relies heavily* on correctly implemented guards.
    *   **Example:** A guard checking for a role but failing to handle edge cases, or a guard applied incorrectly.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly test guards. Apply guards appropriately. Use well-established authorization patterns. Avoid `@Res()` and `@Req()` within guarded routes without careful validation.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Inter-Service Communication (if Microservices are used)](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_inter-service_communication__if_microservices_are_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between microservices without proper security measures (TLS, authentication, authorization) can be intercepted or manipulated.
    *   **How NestJS Contributes:** NestJS provides *built-in* support and abstractions for various microservice transport layers and patterns. The framework actively *facilitates* and simplifies the creation of microservice architectures, making secure communication a direct responsibility within the NestJS context.
    *   **Example:** Microservices communicating over plain HTTP without TLS.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, man-in-the-middle attacks, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use secure transport protocols (gRPC with TLS, HTTPS). Implement mutual TLS (mTLS). Use a service mesh. Implement authorization checks between services.
        *   **User:** (Not directly applicable).
