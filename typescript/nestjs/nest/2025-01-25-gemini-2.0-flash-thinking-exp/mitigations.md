# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Mitigation Strategy: [Externalized and Secure Configuration Management using `@nestjs/config`](./mitigation_strategies/externalized_and_secure_configuration_management_using__@nestjsconfig_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `@nestjs/config` module:**  Install and configure the `@nestjs/config` module. This module provides a structured way to manage application configuration within NestJS. Install it using `npm install @nestjs/config`.
    2.  **Load configuration via `@nestjs/config`:** Configure `@nestjs/config` to load settings from various sources like environment variables, `.env` files, or configuration files.  Use the `ConfigModule.forRoot()` method in your main application module (e.g., `app.module.ts`) to set up configuration loading.
    3.  **Access configuration using `ConfigService`:** Inject the `ConfigService` into your NestJS components (services, controllers, etc.) to access configuration values in a type-safe manner. Use methods like `configService.get<string>('DATABASE_PASSWORD')`.
    4.  **Validate configuration with `joi` (integrated with `@nestjs/config`):**  Leverage `joi` validation schemas within `@nestjs/config` to define the expected structure and types of your configuration. This ensures configuration integrity and catches errors early during application startup.
    5.  **Securely manage secrets outside of code:**  Use external secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and retrieve secrets via `@nestjs/config` or directly within your services, avoiding hardcoding secrets in your NestJS application.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files within the application. `@nestjs/config` encourages externalization, reducing this risk.
        *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect or missing configuration parameters leading to security flaws. Validation with `joi` within `@nestjs/config` helps prevent this.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of Sensitive Information: High risk reduction. Externalizing configuration and secrets significantly reduces the risk of accidental exposure in the codebase.
        *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Medium risk reduction. Configuration validation improves application robustness and reduces security risks from misconfiguration.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `@nestjs/config` module is used to load environment variables from `.env` files in development.
        *   Database credentials are stored as environment variables in the deployment environment.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Integrate with a dedicated secret management service (e.g., Vault) for production secrets, accessed via `@nestjs/config` or directly in services.
        *   Implement comprehensive configuration validation using `joi` schemas within `@nestjs/config` for all configuration parameters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Authentication and Authorization using NestJS Guards](./mitigation_strategies/robust_authentication_and_authorization_using_nestjs_guards.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Authentication using `@nestjs/passport` (optional but common):** While not strictly required, `@nestjs/passport` simplifies integrating various authentication strategies (JWT, OAuth, etc.) into NestJS. Choose and implement a suitable strategy.
    2.  **Create NestJS Guards:** Define NestJS Guards to encapsulate authorization logic. Guards are classes decorated with `@Injectable()` and implementing the `CanActivate` interface. They determine if a request should be allowed to proceed based on authentication and authorization checks.
    3.  **Implement authorization logic within Guards:** Inside your Guards, implement the logic to check user roles, permissions, or any other authorization criteria. You can access request context, user information (if authenticated), and other relevant data within Guards.
    4.  **Apply Guards using `@UseGuards()` decorator:**  Use the `@UseGuards()` decorator on controllers or individual route handlers to apply your Guards. This decorator instructs NestJS to execute the specified Guards before allowing access to the route.
    5.  **Combine Guards for complex authorization:** You can apply multiple Guards to a route, creating a chain of authorization checks. NestJS executes Guards sequentially.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):**  Lack of proper authorization controls allowing users to access resources or functionalities they shouldn't. NestJS Guards are designed to enforce authorization.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: High risk reduction. Guards are a core NestJS mechanism for enforcing access control, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   JWT authentication using `@nestjs/passport` is implemented for user login.
        *   Basic role-based authorization is implemented using NestJS Guards for certain admin routes.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement more granular permission-based authorization beyond basic roles within Guards.
        *   Apply Guards consistently across all routes requiring authorization.
        *   Consider using custom decorators to simplify applying common sets of Guards.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Input Validation using NestJS Pipes](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_input_validation_using_nestjs_pipes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize NestJS Pipes for input validation:**  Employ NestJS Pipes to validate all incoming data in your application. Pipes are classes decorated with `@Injectable()` that transform or validate request input.
    2.  **Use built-in `ValidationPipe`:**  Leverage the built-in `ValidationPipe` for automatic validation based on DTOs and validation decorators. Instantiate `ValidationPipe` and apply it globally or to specific routes using `@UsePipes()`.
    3.  **Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with `class-validator` decorators:** Create DTO classes to define the structure of expected input data. Use decorators from the `class-validator` library (install with `npm install class-validator class-transformer`) within DTOs to specify validation rules (e.g., `@IsString()`, `@IsEmail()`, `@MinLength()`).
    4.  **Apply `ValidationPipe` globally or per route:**  Apply `ValidationPipe` globally in your `main.ts` for application-wide validation, or use `@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())` at the controller or method level for more targeted validation.
    5.  **Create custom Pipes for complex validation:** For validation logic not covered by `ValidationPipe` and decorators, create custom Pipes. Implement the `PipeTransform` interface and define your custom validation logic within the `transform` method.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL injection, NoSQL injection, Command Injection, etc., are mitigated by validating input and ensuring it conforms to expected formats, preventing malicious code injection.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):**  Invalid or malformed input data can lead to application errors or unexpected behavior. Pipes ensure data conforms to defined schemas.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection Attacks: High risk reduction. Input validation using Pipes is a primary defense against injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium risk reduction. Validation improves data quality and application stability.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `ValidationPipe` is used globally in `main.ts`.
        *   DTOs with basic validation decorators are used for request bodies in some controllers.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Ensure all request parameters (query, path, body) are validated using `ValidationPipe` and DTOs across all controllers and routes.
        *   Implement more comprehensive and stricter validation rules in DTOs using `class-validator` decorators.
        *   Consider creating custom Pipes for specific, complex validation scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling using NestJS Global Exception Filters](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_using_nestjs_global_exception_filters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Global Exception Filter:** Implement a NestJS Global Exception Filter. Create a class decorated with `@Catch()` and implementing the `ExceptionFilter` interface.  Use `@Catch()` without arguments to catch all unhandled exceptions, or specify exception types to handle specific exceptions.
    2.  **Implement exception handling logic in the Filter:** Within your Exception Filter's `catch(exception: any, host: ArgumentsHost)` method, define how to handle exceptions.
    3.  **Return generic error responses to clients:** In production, within your Exception Filter, construct and return generic error responses to clients (e.g., "Internal Server Error"). Avoid exposing detailed error messages or stack traces.
    4.  **Log detailed error information internally:**  Within the Exception Filter, log detailed error information (including stack traces, exception details) using NestJS `Logger` or a dedicated logging service. This information is for internal debugging and monitoring, not for client exposure.
    5.  **Register the Global Exception Filter:** Register your custom Exception Filter globally in your `main.ts` file using `app.useGlobalFilters(new YourGlobalExceptionFilter())`.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Leakage through Error Messages (Medium Severity):** Verbose error messages in production exposing internal application details to potential attackers. Global Exception Filters prevent this by controlling error responses.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Leakage through Error Messages: Medium risk reduction. Global Exception Filters prevent the exposure of sensitive internal information in error responses.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A basic global exception filter is implemented to catch unhandled exceptions and return a generic error message.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Configure the global exception filter to log detailed error information internally using a structured logging approach.
        *   Ensure the global exception filter is robust and handles various exception types gracefully.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting using `@nestjs/throttler`](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_using__@nestjsthrottler_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install `@nestjs/throttler` module:** Install the `@nestjs/throttler` module using `npm install @nestjs/throttler`.
    2.  **Configure `ThrottlerModule` globally:**  Import and configure `ThrottlerModule` in your main application module (`app.module.ts`) using `ThrottlerModule.forRoot()`. Set global rate limits (requests per time window) and time-to-live (TTL) for rate limiting.
    3.  **Apply `@Throttle()` decorator to controllers or routes:** Use the `@Throttle(limit, ttl)` decorator on controllers or individual route handlers to apply rate limiting. You can override the global limits and TTL at the controller or route level.
    4.  **Customize error handling (optional):**  Customize the error response when rate limits are exceeded by providing a custom error handler in the `ThrottlerModule.forRoot()` configuration.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):**  Attackers overwhelming the application with excessive requests. `@nestjs/throttler` limits request rates, mitigating DoS risks.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (login, registration) using `@nestjs/throttler` makes brute-force attacks slower and less effective.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS Attacks: High risk reduction. Rate limiting is a key mechanism to protect against DoS attacks and maintain application availability.
        *   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium risk reduction. Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks significantly harder.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No rate limiting is currently implemented using `@nestjs/throttler`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting using `@nestjs/throttler` module globally or for critical endpoints.
        *   Configure appropriate rate limits and TTL values based on application traffic and resource capacity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [GraphQL Security with `@nestjs/graphql` (If GraphQL is used)](./mitigation_strategies/graphql_security_with__@nestjsgraphql___if_graphql_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Field-Level Authorization in GraphQL Resolvers:** Within your GraphQL resolvers (using `@nestjs/graphql`), implement authorization logic at the field level. Check user permissions before resolving specific fields, ensuring users only access data they are authorized to see.
    2.  **Use NestJS Guards for GraphQL resolvers:** You can also apply NestJS Guards to GraphQL resolvers using `@UseGuards()` decorator, similar to REST controllers, to enforce authorization for entire resolvers or specific resolver methods.
    3.  **Implement GraphQL Query Complexity Limits:**  Use libraries or techniques to analyze and limit the complexity of incoming GraphQL queries. This prevents excessively complex queries that could lead to DoS attacks by overloading the server.
    4.  **Carefully consider disabling Introspection in Production:** Disabling GraphQL introspection in production can reduce information leakage about your schema. However, be aware that this can also impact debugging and tooling. If disabling, ensure you have alternative methods for schema documentation and exploration.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access in GraphQL (High Severity):**  Lack of field-level authorization in GraphQL can lead to users accessing data they are not permitted to see.
        *   **GraphQL Query Complexity DoS (Medium to High Severity):**  Maliciously crafted complex GraphQL queries can exhaust server resources and cause denial of service.
        *   **Information Disclosure via GraphQL Introspection (Low to Medium Severity):**  Exposing the GraphQL schema via introspection in production can reveal sensitive information about your API structure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access in GraphQL: High risk reduction. Field-level authorization prevents unauthorized data access within GraphQL APIs.
        *   GraphQL Query Complexity DoS: Medium to High risk reduction. Query complexity limits protect against DoS attacks via complex queries.
        *   Information Disclosure via GraphQL Introspection: Low to Medium risk reduction. Disabling introspection (carefully) reduces schema information leakage.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   GraphQL is not currently used in the project. (Assume for this example).
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   If GraphQL is adopted, implement field-level authorization in resolvers.
        *   Implement GraphQL query complexity limits.
        *   Evaluate and decide on introspection settings for production GraphQL API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TypeORM Security with `@nestjs/typeorm` (If TypeORM is used)](./mitigation_strategies/typeorm_security_with__@nestjstypeorm___if_typeorm_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prevent SQL Injection by using TypeORM features:**  When using TypeORM with `@nestjs/typeorm`, primarily rely on TypeORM's query builder, entity repositories, and parameterized queries. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries directly from user input.
    2.  **Use parameterized queries:**  When you need to perform database queries with user-provided data, always use parameterized queries provided by TypeORM. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not as SQL code, preventing SQL injection.
    3.  **Apply input validation (using NestJS Pipes - as described above):**  Complement TypeORM's security features with robust input validation using NestJS Pipes. Validate all user input before it is used in database queries, even when using TypeORM.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:** Configure database user accounts used by your NestJS application with the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary database permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables) required for the application to function. Avoid granting overly broad permissions like `GRANT ALL`.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise. TypeORM's features and parameterized queries help prevent this.
        *   **Unauthorized Database Access (High Severity):**  Overly permissive database user accounts can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform administrative actions on the database if the application is compromised.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   SQL Injection: High risk reduction. Using TypeORM correctly and employing parameterized queries is crucial for preventing SQL injection.
        *   Unauthorized Database Access: High risk reduction. Principle of least privilege for database access limits the potential damage from compromised application credentials.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   TypeORM is used for database interactions via `@nestjs/typeorm`.
        *   TypeORM's query builder and entity repositories are generally used.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Ensure parameterized queries are consistently used throughout the application when dealing with user input in database interactions.
        *   Review and enforce the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by the NestJS application.
        *   Regularly audit database queries for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, even when using TypeORM.
