Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving NestJS:

**Critical Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker might compromise a third-party library or create a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency. The attacker could then trick the NestJS application's dependency injection container into injecting this malicious dependency, potentially gaining control over application logic or data.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, or complete application takeover.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** Dependency Injection Container.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and update dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Use dependency pinning to ensure consistent versions.
        *   Verify the integrity and source of dependencies before installation.
        *   Consider using a private registry for internal dependencies.

**High Threats:**

*   **Threat:**  Unintended Service Exposure via Global Scope
    *   **Description:** A developer might accidentally register a service with a global scope when it should be request-scoped or transient. An attacker could then exploit this by accessing the same instance of the service across multiple requests managed by NestJS, potentially leading to data leakage or race conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, information disclosure, inconsistent application state.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** Modules, Providers, Dependency Injection Container.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider the scope of each service (request, transient, default).
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining service scopes.
        *   Thoroughly review module and provider configurations.
        *   Use linting rules to enforce proper scoping practices.
*   **Threat:**  Guard Bypass due to Logic Errors
    *   **Description:** An attacker might identify flaws in the logic of a custom NestJS Guard. By crafting specific requests that are processed by NestJS's routing mechanism and evaluated by the Guard, the attacker could bypass the intended authorization checks and access protected resources or functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** Guards.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test Guard logic with various input scenarios, including edge cases and invalid data.
        *   Keep Guard logic simple and avoid complex conditional statements.
        *   Consider using well-tested and established authorization libraries or patterns.
        *   Implement unit tests specifically for Guard logic.
*   **Threat:**  Insecure Configuration Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) if it's stored insecurely within the NestJS application's configuration mechanisms (e.g., directly in code, in unencrypted configuration files accessed by the `ConfigModule`).
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, compromise of backend systems.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** Configuration Loading Mechanisms (e.g., `ConfigModule`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure configuration management techniques like environment variables managed by a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.
