# Threat Model Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Critical Internal Services](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_critical_internal_services.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Critical Internal Services
*   **Description:** An attacker could critically compromise the application by gaining unauthorized access to highly sensitive internal services due to improper scoping or exporting of NestJS providers and modules. If developers mistakenly expose internal services handling sensitive data or core business logic through module exports or use overly broad scopes (like `GLOBAL`), attackers could exploit these services. This could be achieved by manipulating dependencies or accessing unexpected routes, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of application logic, massive data breaches, complete privilege escalation, and severe disruption of service.
*   **Affected NestJS Component:** Modules, Providers, Dependency Injection Container
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define module boundaries and meticulously control exports.
    *   Utilize the most restrictive appropriate provider scopes (`REQUEST`, `TRANSIENT`, `DEFAULT`) based on service necessity. Avoid `GLOBAL` scope unless absolutely essential and with extreme caution.
    *   Implement rigorous code reviews focusing on module exports and provider scopes.
    *   Enforce principle of least privilege for all services, even internal ones, to limit damage from accidental exposure.
    *   Consider using private modules or features to further encapsulate sensitive internal logic.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Misconfigured Route Guards](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_misconfigured_route_guards.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass via Misconfigured Route Guards
*   **Description:** An attacker could achieve complete authorization bypass and gain access to critical protected resources if NestJS Route Guards are incorrectly implemented or configured.  Logical flaws in guard implementation, failure to apply guards to sensitive routes, or misconfiguration of the guard execution context can all lead to this. Attackers could then access administrative panels, sensitive data endpoints, or execute privileged actions without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete bypass of access control, unauthorized access to all protected resources, potential for full data breaches, privilege escalation to administrative levels, and complete system takeover.
*   **Affected NestJS Component:** Guards, Controllers, Routes
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement comprehensive and rigorous testing of Route Guards, covering all user roles, permissions, and access scenarios.
    *   Utilize extensive unit and integration tests specifically designed to verify guard logic and authorization enforcement.
    *   Mandatory application of Guards to *all* routes requiring authorization, with no exceptions for sensitive endpoints.
    *   Adhere to secure coding practices and expert review during custom Guard implementation.
    *   Establish regular security audits focusing specifically on Route Guard configurations and effectiveness.

## Threat: [Critical Injection Vulnerabilities due to Insufficient Input Validation in Pipes](./threats/critical_injection_vulnerabilities_due_to_insufficient_input_validation_in_pipes.md)

*   **Threat:** Critical Injection Vulnerabilities due to Insufficient Input Validation in Pipes
*   **Description:** An attacker could execute critical injection attacks if input validation in NestJS Pipes is insufficient or bypassed. This directly leads to severe vulnerabilities like SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, and potentially code injection if the application processes or displays unvalidated input. Attackers can manipulate request parameters, body, or headers to inject malicious payloads that are then processed by the application due to lack of proper NestJS Pipe validation.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote code execution, complete database compromise (data breaches, data destruction), full system takeover, denial of service, and complete application compromise.
*   **Affected NestJS Component:** Pipes, Controllers, Validation Decorators
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce mandatory and rigorous use of NestJS Pipes for *all* controller inputs without exception.
    *   Implement extremely comprehensive and robust validation rules using industry-standard libraries like `class-validator`.
    *   Define and strictly enforce data types and validation schemas for all input parameters.
    *   Employ input sanitization and output encoding as defense-in-depth measures, even with strong validation.
    *   Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning specifically targeting injection flaws related to input validation.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Leaky Logging Interceptors](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_leaky_logging_interceptors.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Leaky Logging Interceptors
*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially exfiltrate highly sensitive data if NestJS Logging Interceptors are misconfigured to log or inadvertently expose sensitive information. If interceptors are carelessly implemented to log request bodies, response data, or headers without proper sanitization or masking, confidential data like credentials, API keys, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) could be exposed in logs. Attackers could then gain access to these logs through compromised log management systems or by exploiting vulnerabilities in logging infrastructure to extract sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Large-scale data breaches, exposure of sensitive credentials leading to further system compromise, violation of privacy regulations, and significant reputational damage.
*   **Affected NestJS Component:** Interceptors, Logging Interceptor
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews of all Interceptor implementations to guarantee they *never* log sensitive data.
    *   Implement mandatory sanitization and masking of *any* potentially sensitive information *before* logging.
    *   Enforce strict logging configurations with minimal logging levels in production environments, logging only essential information.
    *   Implement robust security measures for log storage and access control, including encryption and access restrictions.
    *   Regularly audit logs for accidental exposure of sensitive data and refine logging practices.

## Threat: [Production System Takeover via Exposed Debug Endpoints](./threats/production_system_takeover_via_exposed_debug_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Production System Takeover via Exposed Debug Endpoints
*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially achieve complete system takeover if debug endpoints or development routes are mistakenly deployed to production environments in a NestJS application. These endpoints, intended for debugging, testing, or development, often provide powerful functionalities that are extremely dangerous if publicly accessible. They could expose sensitive system internals, allow for arbitrary code execution, or grant administrative privileges. Attackers could discover these endpoints through reconnaissance, directory brute-forcing, or by exploiting misconfigurations, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full system takeover, remote code execution, complete data breaches, denial of service, and complete loss of system integrity and confidentiality.
*   **Affected NestJS Component:** Controllers, Modules, Environment Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory utilization of NestJS environment configuration to *completely disable* debug endpoints and development-specific modules in production environments.
    *   Implement robust conditional module loading to ensure development-specific modules are *never* included in production builds.
    *   Establish secure and automated build processes that strictly separate development and production configurations and deployments.
    *   Conduct rigorous pre-production security audits and penetration testing to actively search for and eliminate any accidentally exposed debug endpoints.
    *   Implement runtime environment checks within the application to proactively disable debug features if running in a production environment.
