# Attack Surface Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly validate user inputs allows attackers to send malicious or unexpected data to the application, leading to various vulnerabilities.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** NestJS's reliance on Pipes for input validation makes *incorrect or inconsistent pipe usage* a direct NestJS-related vulnerability.  If developers fail to apply or configure pipes correctly, validation is bypassed.
*   **Example:** A controller endpoint for updating user profiles lacks a `ValidationPipe`. An attacker sends a request with invalid data types that are not checked by NestJS's intended validation mechanism, leading to database errors or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, potential for further exploitation like XSS or SSRF if invalid data is processed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Consistently apply `ValidationPipe` to all controller endpoints and methods receiving user input.
        *   Define strict validation rules within DTOs using class-validator decorators, leveraging NestJS's validation features.
        *   Use custom pipes for complex validation logic, extending NestJS's pipe system.
        *   Thoroughly test input validation, specifically focusing on pipe application and configuration within NestJS controllers.

## Attack Surface: [Guard Bypass due to Incorrect Implementation or Configuration](./attack_surfaces/guard_bypass_due_to_incorrect_implementation_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** NestJS Guards are used for authorization. Incorrectly implemented, misconfigured, or unapplied guards allow attackers to bypass authorization checks.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** Guards are a *core NestJS feature* for securing endpoints. Vulnerabilities in guard logic or application are *directly related to NestJS's security model*.  The framework's authorization mechanism is the point of failure.
*   **Example:** A guard intended to protect admin routes has a logical flaw in its role checking logic *within the NestJS guard implementation*. An attacker with a regular user account exploits this flaw to access admin functionalities, bypassing NestJS's intended authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly test guards with various user roles and access scenarios, specifically testing the logic *within the NestJS guard*.
        *   Ensure guards correctly implement the intended authorization logic and cover all necessary conditions *within the NestJS guard implementation*.
        *   Apply guards consistently to all protected endpoints and routes using NestJS's decorator system.
        *   Regularly review guard implementations and configurations for vulnerabilities *within the NestJS application code*.
        *   Use unit and integration tests to verify guard functionality, focusing on NestJS guard behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication Strategies and Implementation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_strategies_and_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Implementing weak or flawed authentication mechanisms within a NestJS application can lead to credential compromise and unauthorized access.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** NestJS provides the *structure* for authentication (services, guards, interceptors), making *insecure implementations within these NestJS components* a direct attack surface.  While NestJS doesn't dictate *how* to authenticate, vulnerabilities arise from how developers use NestJS features for authentication.
*   **Example:** A NestJS application implements password hashing using a weak algorithm like MD5 *within a NestJS service*. Attackers crack these hashes if they gain database access, compromising user accounts due to insecure practices *within the NestJS application*.
*   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to user accounts and application resources, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize established and secure authentication libraries and strategies, integrating them *within NestJS services and guards*.
        *   Implement strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) *within NestJS services*.
        *   Use secure token generation and storage mechanisms (e.g., JWT with strong secret keys, secure session management) *within NestJS authentication components*.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security *within the NestJS application's authentication flow*.
        *   Follow authentication best practices and security guidelines *when implementing authentication in NestJS*.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities through Malicious Modules](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection_vulnerabilities_through_malicious_modules.md)

*   **Description:** NestJS's dependency injection system relies on modules. Including external or untrusted modules can introduce malicious code or vulnerabilities into the application.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** *Dependency injection is a core NestJS concept*. Vulnerabilities related to module dependencies are *directly linked to NestJS's architecture*. The framework's module system is the entry point for potentially malicious code.
*   **Example:** A developer unknowingly installs a compromised npm package that is disguised as a legitimate NestJS module. This malicious module, when *injected into the application by NestJS's DI system*, could steal data, inject backdoors, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data theft, application compromise, supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Carefully vet all external modules and dependencies *before including them in the NestJS project*.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies *used in the NestJS project*.
        *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions *within the NestJS project*.
        *   Implement a principle of least privilege for module access and permissions *within the NestJS application's module structure*.
        *   Regularly review project dependencies and remove any unnecessary or untrusted modules *from the NestJS project*.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration through Environment Variables or Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_through_environment_variables_or_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly securing environment variables or configuration files can expose sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secrets.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** NestJS applications often use environment variables and configuration files (e.g., using `@nestjs/config`). *If the NestJS application's configuration management is not secured*, it becomes a direct attack surface.  The framework's configuration patterns can lead to vulnerabilities if not handled securely.
*   **Example:** Database connection strings, including usernames and passwords, are stored in plain text in `.env` files *used by the NestJS application* and are accessible in production environments. Attackers gaining access to these files can compromise the database due to insecure configuration practices *within the NestJS deployment*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to backend systems, compromise of external services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users (Deployment):**
        *   Store sensitive configuration securely using dedicated secret management systems, integrating them *with the NestJS application's configuration*.
        *   Encrypt sensitive environment variables or configuration files *used by the NestJS application*.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in code or configuration files *within the NestJS project*.
        *   Implement strict access controls for configuration files and environment variables in deployment environments *hosting the NestJS application*.
        *   Do not commit `.env` files containing sensitive information to version control *for NestJS projects*.
