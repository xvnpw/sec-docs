## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning and Management (NestJS Ecosystem Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning_and_management__nestjs_ecosystem_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning and Management for NestJS Project Dependencies.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate `npm audit` or `yarn audit` into NestJS CI/CD pipeline:** Add a step in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` specifically within your NestJS project directory after `npm install` or `yarn install`. This will check for known vulnerabilities in npm packages, including NestJS core libraries and modules, used in your application.
    2.  **Configure build to fail on high severity NestJS dependency vulnerabilities:** Set up your CI/CD pipeline to fail the build if `npm audit` or `yarn audit` reports high severity vulnerabilities within the NestJS project's dependencies. This ensures immediate attention to critical security issues in the NestJS ecosystem components.
    3.  **Regularly review and update NestJS and related dependencies:** Schedule regular reviews of updates for NestJS core libraries (`@nestjs/*` packages) and other dependencies used in your NestJS project. Prioritize security updates and use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to keep dependencies current.
    4.  **Utilize a dedicated dependency vulnerability scanner for NestJS projects (Optional but Recommended):** Consider using a commercial or open-source dependency vulnerability scanner (like Snyk, Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle, or OWASP Dependency-Check) specifically tailored for Node.js and npm projects, to get more comprehensive vulnerability detection for your NestJS application's dependencies. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
    5.  **Implement a process for vulnerability remediation in NestJS dependencies:** Establish a clear process for addressing identified vulnerabilities in NestJS project dependencies, including prioritizing based on severity, evaluating fixes, testing updates within the NestJS application context, and deploying patched versions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised NestJS Dependencies (High Severity):** Malicious code injected into a NestJS dependency or a dependency used by NestJS can directly compromise the application and potentially the server.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in NestJS Dependencies (High to Medium Severity):** Publicly known vulnerabilities in NestJS core libraries, modules, or their dependencies can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or steal data within the NestJS application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised NestJS Dependencies:** High reduction in risk if combined with other supply chain security measures focused on the NestJS ecosystem.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in NestJS Dependencies:** High reduction in risk by proactively identifying and patching vulnerabilities specifically within the NestJS dependency tree.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`npm audit` in CI/CD for NestJS project:** Yes, implemented in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file as part of the build process for the NestJS application. The build fails on high severity vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` in the NestJS project.
