# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
    - Provide a robust and scalable framework for building efficient Node.js server-side applications.
    - Enhance developer productivity and experience through a well-structured and feature-rich framework.
    - Foster a strong and active community around the NestJS framework.
    - Promote the adoption of NestJS as a leading framework for enterprise-grade Node.js applications.
- Most important business risks:
    - Security vulnerabilities within the framework could lead to application breaches, damaging user trust and hindering adoption.
    - Performance bottlenecks or scalability limitations could restrict the framework's applicability for large-scale enterprise applications.
    - Lack of comprehensive documentation or a steep learning curve could deter developers from adopting NestJS.
    - Dependency on external libraries and the Node.js ecosystem introduces supply chain risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
    - security control: Code review process on GitHub pull requests to ensure code quality and identify potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution workflow.
    - security control: Dependency management using `package-lock.json` or similar to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. Implemented in: Project repository.
    - security control: Public issue reporting on GitHub to allow community members to report potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub issue tracker.
- Accepted risks:
    - accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure might be public before a patch is available, potentially leading to zero-day exploits.
    - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and fixes, which might introduce delays in response times.
- Recommended security controls:
    - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
    - security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning tools to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    - security control: Establish a documented process for handling security vulnerabilities, including triage, patching, and disclosure, potentially involving a dedicated security team or point of contact.
- Security requirements:
    - Authentication:
        - Requirement: NestJS applications should be able to implement various authentication mechanisms such as JWT, OAuth 2.0, and session-based authentication.
        - Requirement: The framework should provide modules and guidance to easily integrate authentication strategies.
    - Authorization:
        - Requirement: NestJS applications should support role-based access control (RBAC) and potentially attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage user permissions.
        - Requirement: The framework should offer mechanisms to define and enforce authorization policies at different levels (e.g., controller, service).
    - Input Validation:
        - Requirement: NestJS should encourage and facilitate input validation to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
        - Requirement: The framework should provide utilities or integrate with validation libraries to simplify input validation processes.
    - Cryptography:
        - Requirement: NestJS applications might need to handle sensitive data, and the framework should not hinder the implementation of cryptographic operations.
        - Requirement: While not directly providing cryptographic primitives, NestJS documentation and examples should promote secure cryptographic practices when handling sensitive data.

- Build Process Description:
    - Developers commit code changes to the GitHub repository.
    - Continuous Integration (CI) system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered on code changes.
    - The build process is executed, typically using npm scripts to compile TypeScript code, bundle modules, and prepare artifacts.
    - Automated tests (unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests) are run to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - If tests pass, security checks are performed, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code vulnerabilities and dependency vulnerability scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - If security checks pass, build artifacts (e.g., npm packages) are published to an artifact repository (e.g., npm registry).
    - From the artifact repository, the application can be deployed to various deployment environments.
