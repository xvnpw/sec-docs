### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.2.3 Insecure Route Parameter Handling [Critical Node - Insecure Route Params] --> Injection Attacks

#### 4.1. Explanation of the Vulnerability: Insecure Route Parameter Handling

Insecure route parameter handling arises when a NestJS application directly uses route parameters (values extracted from the URL path) in backend operations without proper validation or sanitization.  Route parameters are a common way to pass dynamic data to an application, often used to identify specific resources or actions.

**How it works in NestJS:**

NestJS uses decorators like `@Param()` to extract route parameters from the URL. For example, in a route like `/users/:id`, the `:id` part is a route parameter.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get(':id')
  getUser(@Param('id') id: string): string {
    // Potentially vulnerable code here using 'id' directly
    return `User ID: ${id}`;
  }
}
```

**The Vulnerability:**

If the `id` parameter in the example above is directly used in database queries, file system operations, or system commands without validation or sanitization, it becomes a potential entry point for injection attacks. Attackers can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL to inject malicious code or commands that are then executed by the application.

**Why it's a Critical Node:**

This vulnerability is considered critical because:

*   **Common Input Point:** Route parameters are a fundamental part of web application routing and are frequently used to handle dynamic requests.
*   **Easy to Exploit:** Exploiting this vulnerability often requires minimal effort from an attacker, simply manipulating the URL.
*   **High Impact:** Successful injection attacks can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   **Frequent Occurrence:** Lack of input validation is a common oversight in development, making this vulnerability prevalent in web applications.

#### 4.2. Injection Attack Vectors and Examples in NestJS

Let's explore specific injection attack vectors that can be exploited through insecure route parameter handling in NestJS applications:

##### 4.2.1. SQL Injection

**Attack Vector:** If a route parameter is used directly in a raw SQL query without proper parameterization or sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Vulnerable NestJS Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Connection } from 'typeorm';

@Controller('products')
export class ProductsController {
  constructor(@Inject('DATABASE_CONNECTION') private connection: Connection) {}

  @Get(':productId')
  async getProduct(@Param('productId') productId: string): Promise<any> {
    // Vulnerable SQL query - directly using productId
    const query = `SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ${productId}`;
    try {
      const products = await this.connection.query(query);
      return products[0];
    } catch (error) {
      return { error: 'Product not found' };
    }
  }
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a URL like `/products/1 OR 1=1--`

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1--
```

The `OR 1=1--` part is injected SQL code. `1=1` is always true, and `--` is a SQL comment, commenting out the rest of the original query. This would bypass the intended `WHERE` clause and potentially return all products from the database, or worse, allow further malicious SQL operations.

**Impact:**

*   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data, modification, or deletion of data.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing security checks.
*   **Denial of Service:** Crashing the database server.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries provided by TypeORM or other database libraries. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not code.

**Secure NestJS Code Example (Parameterized Query):**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Connection } from 'typeorm';

@Controller('products')
export class ProductsController {
  constructor(@Inject('DATABASE_CONNECTION') private connection: Connection) {}

  @Get(':productId')
  async getProduct(@Param('productId') productId: string): Promise<any> {
    // Secure parameterized query
    try {
      const products = await this.connection.query(
        'SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ?',
        [productId], // productId is passed as a parameter
      );
      return products[0];
    } catch (error) {
      return { error: 'Product not found' };
    }
  }
}
```

##### 4.2.2. Path Traversal (Directory Traversal)

**Attack Vector:** If a route parameter is used to construct file paths without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate the parameter to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

**Vulnerable NestJS Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, Res } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Response } from 'express';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';

@Controller('files')
export class FilesController {
  @Get(':filename')
  getFile(@Param('filename') filename: string, @Res() res: Response): void {
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads', filename); // Vulnerable path construction

    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(404).send('File not found');
      }
      res.contentType('application/octet-stream');
      res.send(data);
    });
  }
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a URL like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`

This would result in the following file path being constructed:

```
/app/src/uploads/../../../../etc/passwd
```

Due to the `../../../../` sequence, the path would traverse up the directory structure and potentially access the `/etc/passwd` file, which is outside the intended `uploads` directory.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive files, configuration files, or source code.
*   **System Compromise:** In some cases, writing to arbitrary files might be possible, leading to further exploitation.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate the route parameter to ensure it only contains allowed characters and patterns. Sanitize the input to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters like `..`.
*   **Path Normalization:** Use `path.normalize()` to resolve relative path segments and prevent traversal.
*   **Restrict File Access:** Implement access control mechanisms to limit file access based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Whitelist Allowed Paths:** Instead of blacklisting dangerous characters, whitelist allowed file paths or extensions.

**Secure NestJS Code Example (Path Validation and Normalization):**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, Res, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Response } from 'express';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';

@Controller('files')
export class FilesController {
  @Get(':filename')
  getFile(@Param('filename') filename: string, @Res() res: Response): void {
    // Validate filename (example: allow only alphanumeric and underscores)
    if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+$/.test(filename)) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Invalid filename');
    }

    const basePath = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');
    const filePath = path.normalize(path.join(basePath, filename)); // Path normalization

    // Ensure the resolved path is still within the allowed base path
    if (!filePath.startsWith(basePath)) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Invalid filename'); // Prevent path traversal
    }

    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(404).send('File not found');
      }
      res.contentType('application/octet-stream');
      res.send(data);
    });
  }
}
```

##### 4.2.3. Command Injection (Operating System Command Injection)

**Attack Vector:** If a route parameter is used to construct or execute operating system commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.

**Vulnerable NestJS Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';
import { exec } from 'child_process';

@Controller('utils')
export class UtilsController {
  @Get('ping/:host')
  pingHost(@Param('host') host: string): Promise<string> {
    // Vulnerable command execution - directly using host
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      exec(`ping -c 3 ${host}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        if (error) {
          reject(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        } else {
          resolve(stdout);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a URL like `/utils/ping/example.com; ls -l`

This would result in the following command being executed:

```bash
ping -c 3 example.com; ls -l
```

The `; ls -l` part is injected command code. The semicolon `;` acts as a command separator, allowing the attacker to execute the `ls -l` command after the `ping` command.

**Impact:**

*   **System Compromise:** Full control over the server, including data access, modification, and deletion.
*   **Malware Installation:** Installing malicious software on the server.
*   **Denial of Service:** Crashing the server or using it for malicious activities like botnets.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Avoid Executing System Commands:**  Whenever possible, avoid executing system commands based on user input. Look for alternative methods or libraries that provide the required functionality without resorting to command execution.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate the route parameter to allow only expected characters and patterns. Sanitize the input to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters like semicolons, pipes, and backticks.
*   **Parameterization/Escaping:** If command execution is unavoidable, use libraries or functions that provide proper parameterization or escaping for shell commands to prevent injection.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.

**Secure NestJS Code Example (Input Validation and Avoiding Command Execution - Example using a library instead of `ping`):**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';
// In a real scenario, you might use a library for network utilities instead of 'ping' command
// For demonstration, we'll just validate the host format.

@Controller('utils')
export class UtilsController {
  @Get('ping/:host')
  pingHost(@Param('host') host: string): string {
    // Validate host format (example: basic hostname validation)
    if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$/.test(host)) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Invalid hostname format');
    }

    // In a real application, instead of exec('ping'), you would ideally use
    // a Node.js library for network utilities that doesn't involve shell command execution.
    // For this example, we are just returning a placeholder to demonstrate secure input handling.

    return `Pinging host: ${host} (Command execution avoided for security)`;
  }
}
```

**Note:** The "secure" command injection example above primarily focuses on *avoiding* command execution and validating input.  Truly secure command execution is extremely complex and often discouraged.  The best mitigation is to avoid executing system commands based on user input whenever possible. If absolutely necessary, use robust libraries for command parameterization and follow strict security guidelines.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies Summary

To effectively mitigate the risk of insecure route parameter handling and prevent injection attacks in NestJS applications, development teams should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Always validate route parameters:**  Verify that the input conforms to the expected format, data type, and length.
    *   **Use validation pipes in NestJS:** Leverage NestJS's built-in validation pipes (e.g., `ValidationPipe`, custom pipes) to enforce validation rules on route parameters.
    *   **Define validation schemas:** Use libraries like `class-validator` and `class-transformer` to define clear validation schemas for route parameters.

2.  **Input Sanitization (Context-Aware Encoding):**
    *   **Sanitize input based on context:**  Encode or escape user input appropriately depending on where it will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for display in web pages, SQL escaping for database queries).
    *   **Use parameterized queries for databases:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Avoid direct string concatenation in queries:**  Never directly embed user input into raw SQL queries.

3.  **Path Normalization and Validation (for Path Traversal):**
    *   **Normalize file paths:** Use `path.normalize()` to resolve relative path segments and prevent directory traversal.
    *   **Validate resolved paths:** Ensure that the resolved file path stays within the intended directory or allowed path list.
    *   **Whitelist allowed file extensions or paths:**  Restrict access to only specific file types or directories.

4.  **Avoid Command Execution (for Command Injection):**
    *   **Minimize or eliminate system command execution:**  Whenever possible, find alternative methods or libraries that do not involve executing shell commands.
    *   **If command execution is necessary:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize input:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization to remove or encode dangerous characters.
        *   **Use parameterization/escaping for shell commands:**  Utilize libraries or functions that provide secure parameterization or escaping for shell commands.
        *   **Principle of least privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges.

5.  **Security Audits and Testing:**
    *   **Regular security code reviews:**  Conduct code reviews to identify potential insecure route parameter handling vulnerabilities.
    *   **Penetration testing:**  Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated security scanning:**  Use static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.

#### 4.4. Risk Assessment

**Likelihood:** **High**. Insecure route parameter handling is a common vulnerability due to:

*   **Developer oversight:**  Developers may overlook the importance of input validation, especially for seemingly simple route parameters.
*   **Complexity of validation:**  Implementing robust validation and sanitization can be perceived as complex or time-consuming.
*   **Framework defaults:**  While NestJS provides tools for validation, it doesn't enforce it by default, requiring developers to actively implement security measures.

**Impact:** **Critical**. The impact of successful injection attacks stemming from insecure route parameter handling can be severe:

*   **Data breaches:** Loss of sensitive customer data, financial information, or intellectual property.
*   **System compromise:** Full control over the application server, leading to malware installation, denial of service, or further attacks.
*   **Reputational damage:** Loss of customer trust and damage to brand reputation.
*   **Financial losses:** Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal liabilities, and regulatory fines.

**Overall Risk:** **Critical**. The combination of high likelihood and critical impact makes insecure route parameter handling a significant security risk that must be addressed proactively in NestJS application development.

#### 4.5. Conclusion

Insecure route parameter handling is a critical vulnerability in NestJS applications that can lead to severe injection attacks, including SQL Injection, Path Traversal, and Command Injection.  By failing to properly validate and sanitize route parameters, developers inadvertently create entry points for attackers to manipulate application behavior and potentially compromise the entire system.

To mitigate this risk, development teams must prioritize secure coding practices, including robust input validation, context-aware sanitization, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.  Leveraging NestJS's validation features and adopting secure development workflows are crucial steps in building resilient and secure applications. Regular security audits and penetration testing are also essential to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

By understanding the risks associated with insecure route parameter handling and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the attack surface of their NestJS applications and protect them from injection attacks.
