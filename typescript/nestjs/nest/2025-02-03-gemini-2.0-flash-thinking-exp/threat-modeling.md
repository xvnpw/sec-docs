# Threat Model Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Threat: [Insecure Dependencies in Modules](./threats/insecure_dependencies_in_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure dependencies used by NestJS modules. They might leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service. This is achieved by targeting application functionalities that rely on these vulnerable module dependencies.
*   **Impact:**  Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Nest Component:** Modules, Dependency Injection
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
    *   Use dependency scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Practice least privilege when importing modules.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/route_parameter_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious input into route parameters if validation using NestJS Pipes is insufficient or bypassed. This could lead to attacks like SQL injection, command injection, or path traversal, depending on how the unsanitized parameter is used within the controller logic. Attackers manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious payloads, exploiting the lack of proper input sanitization provided by NestJS Pipes.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, arbitrary code execution, file system access, denial of service.
*   **Affected Nest Component:** Controllers, Routing, Pipes
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always** use Pipes for route parameter validation and transformation.
    *   Enforce strict input validation rules within Pipes.
    *   Avoid using raw route parameters in sensitive operations without validation.

## Threat: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities present in custom or third-party middleware used within the NestJS application. These vulnerabilities could allow them to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or execute arbitrary code. Attackers would target known vulnerabilities in middleware libraries or flaws in custom middleware code integrated into the NestJS application.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, arbitrary code execution, denial of service.
*   **Affected Nest Component:** Middleware, Third-party Libraries, NestJS Request Lifecycle
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit custom middleware code.
    *   Use reputable and maintained third-party middleware libraries.
    *   Keep middleware libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Apply security best practices in custom middleware development.

## Threat: [ORM Configuration Misconfigurations Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/orm_configuration_misconfigurations_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigurations in ORM (TypeORM/Mongoose) setup within NestJS applications. This includes exposed database credentials, insecure default settings, or improper use of ORM features leading to injection vulnerabilities. Attackers target database access points and configuration weaknesses exposed through NestJS's ORM integration.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized database access, data manipulation, SQL/NoSQL injection.
*   **Affected Nest Component:** TypeORM/Mongoose Integration, Database Configuration, Modules, NestJS Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely manage database credentials (environment variables, secrets management).
    *   Review and harden default ORM configurations.
    *   Follow ORM security best practices specific to NestJS integration.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent injection attacks.
