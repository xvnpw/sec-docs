*   This is a high-risk area because misconfigurations are common, easily exploitable, and can lead to significant compromise. Attackers often target configuration weaknesses first due to their low effort and potentially high reward.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Insecure Configuration Defaults [Critical Node - Insecure Defaults]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_insecure_configuration_defaults__critical_node_-_insecure_defaults_.md)

*   Using default configurations, especially in production, is a major security risk. Developers may overlook changing default settings, leaving applications vulnerable.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Default Secret Keys/Salts [Critical Node - Default Secrets] --> Compromise Application](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_default_secret_keyssalts__critical_node_-_default_secrets__--_compromise_application.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If default secret keys or salts are used for cryptographic operations (like JWT signing, encryption, hashing), attackers can easily discover or guess these defaults.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete authentication bypass, ability to forge tokens, decrypt sensitive data, or compromise password hashes.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Extremely easy to exploit if defaults are not changed. Requires very low skill and effort from the attacker.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exposed Environment Variables [Critical Node - Exposed Env Vars] --> Compromise Application](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exposed_environment_variables__critical_node_-_exposed_env_vars__--_compromise_application.md)

*   Environment variables are a common way to configure NestJS applications, but improper handling can expose sensitive information.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Sensitive Data in Environment Variables (e.g., DB credentials, API keys) [Critical Node - Sensitive Data in Env Vars] --> Compromise Application](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_sensitive_data_in_environment_variables__e_g___db_credentials__api_keys___critical_node_-_sens_4e7de98e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Storing sensitive data directly in environment variables without proper protection (like secure vaults) makes them vulnerable if the environment is compromised (e.g., server access, container escape, misconfigured cloud services).
    *   **Impact:** Direct access to databases, external APIs, or other critical resources if credentials or API keys are exposed.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Common practice to use environment variables, but often done insecurely. Exploitation is straightforward if environment access is gained.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Misconfigured Modules & Middleware [Critical Node - Misconfigured Middleware]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_misconfigured_modules_&_middleware__critical_node_-_misconfigured_middleware_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Forgetting to apply NestJS Guards to protect specific endpoints leaves them publicly accessible, bypassing intended authorization controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, data, or administrative interfaces.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Simple oversight during development can lead to direct unauthorized access. Easy to discover and exploit.


## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3 Insecure Route Parameter Handling [Critical Node - Insecure Route Params] --> Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3_insecure_route_parameter_handling__critical_node_-_insecure_route_params__--_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Improperly handling route parameters without validation or sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious code or commands through URL parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Injection attacks (SQL, Path Traversal, Command Injection), business logic bypasses.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Route parameters are a common input point. Lack of validation is a frequent vulnerability leading to serious injection flaws.


## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Interceptor & Guard Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_interceptor_&_guard_logic_flaws.md)

*   Logic errors in custom Guards can directly undermine authorization mechanisms.


## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Logic Errors in Custom Guards (Authorization Bypass) [Critical Node - Guard Logic Flaws] --> Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_logic_errors_in_custom_guards__authorization_bypass___critical_node_-_guard_logic_flaws__--_au_c67526ca.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the logic of custom NestJS Guards can lead to incorrect authorization decisions, allowing unauthorized users to bypass security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, allowing access to protected resources or functionalities without proper permissions.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Custom security logic is prone to errors. Logic flaws in Guards directly compromise the application's access control.
