# Attack Surface Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptor/Middleware Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_interceptormiddleware_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in custom NestJS Interceptors or Middleware can directly introduce vulnerabilities, as these components often handle critical security functions like authentication, authorization, and data transformation.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** NestJS encourages and facilitates the use of interceptors and middleware for request/response manipulation and cross-cutting concerns. Flaws in custom implementations within this NestJS framework directly impact application security.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware, implemented as a NestJS middleware, incorrectly verifies JWT tokens, allowing requests with invalid or forged tokens to pass through. An attacker could then bypass authentication and access protected resources.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, data leakage, or other security vulnerabilities depending on the flawed logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom interceptor and middleware logic, especially for security-sensitive functionalities.
        *   Use established and well-vetted libraries for security tasks (e.g., JWT verification libraries, authorization frameworks) instead of implementing custom logic from scratch where possible.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing interceptors and middleware, paying attention to error handling, input validation, and output sanitization.
        *   Conduct security code reviews specifically focusing on interceptor and middleware implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Guards](./attack_surfaces/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_guards.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in NestJS Guard logic or configuration can lead to authentication or authorization bypasses, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **NestJS Contribution:** NestJS Guards are the primary framework mechanism for implementing authorization and access control. Vulnerabilities in guard implementations, a core NestJS feature, directly compromise application security.
*   **Example:** A guard intended to protect an admin route, implemented as a NestJS Guard, has a logical flaw in its authorization check, allowing users with regular roles to bypass the guard and access admin functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation, data breaches, or other security breaches depending on the protected functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test guard logic, especially for complex authorization rules.
        *   Use established and well-vetted authentication and authorization strategies and libraries.
        *   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for guards to ensure they correctly enforce access control policies.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining roles and permissions within guards.
        *   Conduct security code reviews specifically focusing on guard implementations.
