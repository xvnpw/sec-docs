## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting NestJS Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_nestjs_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploiting NestJS Framework Vulnerabilities:**
    * Attackers aim to exploit undiscovered (zero-day) or known but unpatched vulnerabilities within the core NestJS framework or its official modules.
    * This can involve triggering specific code paths through crafted API calls or manipulating data in a way that exposes the vulnerability.
    * Success can lead to arbitrary code execution, complete application takeover, or significant data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known NestJS Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_nestjs_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Known NestJS Vulnerability:**
    * Leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of NestJS or its modules.
    * Attackers identify the application's NestJS version and search for corresponding exploits.
    * Exploitation methods vary depending on the vulnerability but often involve crafting specific requests or inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Core NestJS Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_core_nestjs_libraries__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerability in Core NestJS Libraries:**
    * Targeting vulnerabilities within the fundamental components of the NestJS framework itself (e.g., routing mechanisms, request handling logic).
    * These vulnerabilities can be more widespread and impact a larger number of applications using the affected NestJS version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Official NestJS Modules (@nestjs/*) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_official_nestjs_modules__@nestjs___critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerability in Official NestJS Modules (@nestjs/*):**
    * Focusing on vulnerabilities within the official modules provided by the NestJS team (e.g., `@nestjs/platform-socket.io`, `@nestjs/graphql`).
    * These modules often handle specific functionalities, and their vulnerabilities can lead to targeted attacks on those features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abusing NestJS Features and Misconfigurations [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/abusing_nestjs_features_and_misconfigurations__high_risk_path_start_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Injection Abuse [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_injection_abuse__critical_node_.md)

* **Dependency Injection Abuse:**
    * Exploiting NestJS's dependency injection system to introduce malicious code or manipulate application behavior.
    * **Inject Malicious Service:** Attackers attempt to provide their own crafted service implementations where dependencies are expected, potentially overwriting legitimate services or introducing new malicious functionalities.
    * **Overwrite Existing Service:**  The goal is to replace a legitimate service with a modified version that performs malicious actions, gaining control over specific application components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Service [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_service__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Existing Service [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_existing_service__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Controller and Routing Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/controller_and_routing_exploitation__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Abusing NestJS Features and Misconfigurations -> Controller and Routing Exploitation -> Parameter Tampering:**
    * This path exploits weaknesses in how controllers handle user input and routing parameters.
    * Attackers manipulate URL parameters (path variables, query parameters) to access unauthorized data, trigger unintended actions, or bypass security checks.
    * This is a common attack vector due to its relative simplicity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pipe Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/pipe_exploitation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Validation Pipes [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_validation_pipes__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Abusing NestJS Features and Misconfigurations -> Pipe Exploitation -> Bypass Validation Pipes:**
    * NestJS Pipes are designed for data validation and transformation.
    * Attackers craft input data that circumvents the validation logic implemented in pipes, allowing invalid or malicious data to be processed by the application.
    * This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including injection attacks and data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exception Filter Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exception_filter_abuse__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure in Error Responses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_in_error_responses__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Abusing NestJS Features and Misconfigurations -> Exception Filter Abuse -> Exploit Information Disclosure in Error Responses:**
    * Poorly configured exception filters can expose sensitive information in error messages (e.g., database credentials, internal file paths).
    * Attackers trigger errors and analyze the responses to gather valuable information for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Microservices Communication Exploitation (if used with @nestjs/microservices) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/microservices_communication_exploitation__if_used_with_@nestjsmicroservices___critical_node_.md)

* **Microservices Communication Exploitation (if used with @nestjs/microservices):**
    * Targeting the communication channels between different microservices in a NestJS application.
    * **Intercept or Manipulate Messages Between Microservices:**  If communication is not properly secured (e.g., lacking TLS or message signing), attackers can intercept and alter messages, potentially corrupting data or triggering unintended actions.
    * **Impersonate a Microservice:** Attackers attempt to forge messages to appear as a legitimate microservice, gaining unauthorized access to resources or functionalities intended for that service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept or Manipulate Messages Between Microservices [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_or_manipulate_messages_between_microservices__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate a Microservice [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_a_microservice__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Abusing NestJS Features and Misconfigurations -> Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Expose Sensitive Configuration Data:**
    * Sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials, etc.) is exposed due to insecure storage or access control.
    * Attackers gain access to environment variables, configuration files, or other sources of configuration data, potentially leading to full system compromise or access to external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Dependencies Introduced Through NestJS [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_dependencies_introduced_through_nestjs__high_risk_path_start_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in a Specific Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [HIGH RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_a_specific_dependency__high_risk_path___high_risk_path_end_.md)

* **Exploiting Dependencies Introduced Through NestJS -> Exploit Vulnerability in a Specific Dependency:**
    * NestJS applications rely on numerous third-party libraries (dependencies).
    * Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies and attempt to trigger the vulnerable code paths through interactions with the NestJS application.
    * This highlights the importance of keeping dependencies updated and regularly auditing them for vulnerabilities.
