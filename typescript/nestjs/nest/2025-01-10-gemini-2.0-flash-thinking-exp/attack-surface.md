# Attack Surface Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or Misconfigured Routes](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_misconfigured_routes.md)

*   **Description:**  Routes that are unintentionally exposed or lack proper authentication/authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to application functionalities or data.
*   **How Nest Contributes:**  NestJS's declarative routing system relies on developers correctly defining and securing routes using decorators and Guards. Incorrect or missing Guards directly contribute to this attack surface. The framework's reliance on decorators for route definition makes misconfiguration a direct NestJS-related risk.
*   **Example:** A route like `@Get('admin/users')` without an appropriate `AuthGuard` allowing any unauthenticated user to list all application users.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of application state, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement and enforce authentication using NestJS Guards (e.g., `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)`).
    *   Implement and enforce authorization using NestJS Guards with role-based or permission-based checks.
    *   Review route configurations carefully to ensure intended access controls.
    *   Avoid overly permissive route patterns (e.g., excessive use of wildcards).

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation via Pipes](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_via_pipes.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input, allowing malicious data to be processed by the application.
*   **How Nest Contributes:** NestJS Pipes are the primary mechanism for input validation and transformation within the framework's request lifecycle. Failure to implement or configure Pipes correctly directly exposes the application to this risk. The framework's design encourages the use of Pipes, making their absence or misconfiguration a NestJS-specific concern.
*   **Example:** A controller accepting user input without a validation pipe, allowing an attacker to inject SQL commands through a form field.
*   **Impact:**  SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, data corruption, application crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize NestJS's built-in validation capabilities with libraries like `class-validator` and integrate them via Pipes.
    *   Create and apply custom validation pipes for complex validation logic.
    *   Sanitize user input within transformation pipes to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    *   Validate all sources of input handled by NestJS controllers, including query parameters, request bodies, and headers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure WebSocket Implementations (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_websocket_implementations__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of WebSocket connections and messages.
*   **How Nest Contributes:** NestJS provides modules and decorators (like `@WebSocketGateway`) for WebSocket integration. Improper implementation of authentication, authorization, and message sanitization within these NestJS components directly leads to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A WebSocket gateway implemented using NestJS decorators that doesn't authenticate connections, allowing any user to send and receive messages.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, message spoofing, injection attacks, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections using NestJS Guards or custom logic within the gateway.
    *   Validate and sanitize all incoming WebSocket messages within the NestJS gateway to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement rate limiting and connection management within the NestJS gateway to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Microservices Communication (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_microservices_communication__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insecure communication between NestJS microservices.
*   **How Nest Contributes:** NestJS facilitates microservices communication through various transporters and modules (like `@nestjs/microservices`). Lack of proper security measures configured within these NestJS constructs on the communication channels introduces risk.
*   **Example:** NestJS microservices communicating over TCP without TLS encryption, allowing eavesdropping on sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, manipulation of inter-service communication, unauthorized access to microservices.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure NestJS microservices to use secure communication protocols like TLS for inter-service communication.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for microservice interactions, potentially using NestJS interceptors or dedicated security modules.
    *   Secure service discovery and registration processes used by NestJS microservices.
