# Threat Model Analysis for nestjs/nest

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Manipulation](./threats/dependency_injection_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the dependency injection system to inject malicious or unintended providers. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in custom provider factories or leveraging dynamic modules in unexpected ways. By injecting malicious providers, the attacker could execute arbitrary code within the application's context, intercept sensitive data, or disrupt normal operations.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:**  `@Module()` decorator, `Providers` array, custom provider factories, dynamic modules (`DynamicModule`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the registration of providers, especially when using dynamic modules or custom factories.
        *   Avoid exposing internal providers unnecessarily.
        *   Utilize NestJS's built-in mechanisms for controlling provider scope and lifecycle (e.g., `Scope.REQUEST`, `Scope.TRANSIENT`).
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom provider factory logic.

## Threat: [Interceptor Logic Vulnerabilities](./threats/interceptor_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Interceptors in NestJS modify the request and response cycles. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom interceptor logic to bypass security checks, manipulate data in transit, or inject malicious content into responses. For example, a poorly written interceptor might fail to sanitize user input before logging it, leading to log injection.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass, data manipulation, cross-site scripting (XSS) through response injection, information leakage.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** `@Injectable()` decorator (for interceptors), `@UseInterceptors()` decorator, `NestInterceptor` interface, `intercept()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and audit custom interceptor logic for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure interceptors handle errors gracefully and don't introduce new attack vectors.
        *   Avoid overly complex logic within interceptors; keep them focused on their intended purpose.
        *   Sanitize and validate data within interceptors when necessary.

## Threat: [Guard Bypass](./threats/guard_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Guards in NestJS are responsible for authorization. An attacker could find ways to bypass guard logic, gaining unauthorized access to protected routes and resources. This could be due to flaws in the guard implementation, incorrect configuration, or vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms used by the guard.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** `@Injectable()` decorator (for guards), `@UseGuards()` decorator, `CanActivate` interface, `canActivate()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and well-tested guard logic.
        *   Ensure guards cover all necessary routes and controllers that require authorization.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization.
        *   Regularly review and audit guard implementations.
        *   Use established and secure authentication mechanisms.

## Threat: [Pipe Logic Vulnerabilities](./threats/pipe_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Pipes in NestJS transform and validate request data. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom pipe logic to inject malicious data, bypass validation rules, or cause unexpected behavior. For example, a pipe that doesn't properly sanitize user input could be vulnerable to injection attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data injection, type confusion leading to unexpected behavior, bypassing security validation, potential for further exploitation based on injected data.
    *   **Affected NestJS Component:** `@Injectable()` decorator (for pipes), `@UsePipes()` decorator, `PipeTransform` interface, `transform()` method, built-in validation pipes (`ValidationPipe`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough input validation within pipes using built-in validators or custom logic.
        *   Handle potential errors and exceptions within pipes gracefully.
        *   Be cautious when using custom transformation logic that might introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize NestJS's built-in `ValidationPipe` with appropriate validation rules.
