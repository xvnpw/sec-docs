### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Template Path Definition Provider
- Description:
    1.  The `TemplatePathProvider` in `src/providers/definitionProvider.ts` is responsible for providing "Go to Definition" functionality for Django template paths in `include` and `extends` tags.
    2.  The provider extracts template paths using regular expressions `PATH_RE` and `RELATIVE_PATH_RE`.
    3.  These regular expressions, `/([\w/\-]+\.[\w]+)/` and `/((?:(?:\.\/|(?:\.\.\/)+))[\w/\-]+\.[\w]+)/`, are intended to capture file paths.
    4.  However, they allow characters like `/` and `-` within the path, which could be exploited for path traversal.
    5.  Specifically, an attacker can craft a malicious template path like `'../../../../etc/passwd'` (or similar traversal sequences) within an `include` or `extends` tag in a Django HTML or Python file.
    6.  When a user attempts to "Go to Definition" on this maliciously crafted path, the `TemplatePathProvider` uses `workspace.findFiles` with a search pattern derived from this path.
    7.  If `workspace.findFiles` does not properly sanitize or restrict the search path, it may be possible for the attacker to cause the extension to search for files outside the intended workspace directories (e.g., template directories).
    8.  While the extension itself does not directly expose file contents, successful path traversal could lead to unexpected behavior, potential information disclosure within the VSCode environment, or pave the way for more severe vulnerabilities if combined with other extension features or future modifications.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could potentially cause the "Go to Definition" feature to navigate to files outside the intended template directories.
    - This could lead to information disclosure within the VSCode environment if the extension were to expose file paths or metadata in unexpected ways.
    - In a theoretical scenario, if the extension were to gain file reading capabilities in the future, this path traversal could be leveraged to read arbitrary files accessible to VSCode.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the extracted path in `workspace.findFiles` without any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization:** The extracted path should be sanitized to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like `..`.
    - **Path Validation:** The resolved path should be validated to ensure it stays within the intended template directories of the workspace.
    - **Restricting Search Scope:**  Instead of directly using the user-provided path in `workspace.findFiles`, the extension should construct a more restrictive search pattern that limits the search to template directories and prevents traversal outside of them.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify Django HTML or Python files within a project that is opened in VSCode.
    - The user must have the Django extension for VSCode installed and activated.
    - The user must attempt to use the "Go to Definition" feature (e.g., Ctrl+click or F12) on a maliciously crafted template path in an `include` or `extends` tag.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **File:** `/code/src/providers/definitionProvider.ts`
    2.  **Function:** `TemplatePathProvider.provideDefinition` and `TemplatePathProvider.getTemplate`
    3.  **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        const PATH_RE = regex([quote, path_re, quote])
        const RELATIVE_PATH_RE = regex([quote, rel_path_re, quote])

        // ...

        let match = line.match(PATH_RE)
        let relative_match = line.match(RELATIVE_PATH_RE)

        if (relative_match) {
            path = relative_match[1]
            search = workspace.asRelativePath(resolve(dirname(document.uri.path), path))
        } else if (match) {
            path = match[1]
            search = `**/{templates,jinja2}/${path}`
        }
        ```
    4.  **Analysis:**
        - The code extracts the `path` directly from the regex match without any sanitization.
        - For relative paths, it uses `path.resolve` which resolves `..` but still includes the potentially malicious path in the `search` string.
        - For absolute paths (within the template dirs), it constructs a search string like `**/{templates,jinja2}/${path}`. If `path` contains traversal sequences, `workspace.findFiles` might search in unintended locations.
        - The `search` variable is then directly passed to `workspace.findFiles`.
    5.  **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (Malicious Template Path) --> Regex Extraction (PATH_RE/RELATIVE_PATH_RE) --> Path Variable (Unsanitized) --> Search Pattern Construction --> workspace.findFiles(search) --> Potential Path Traversal if workspace.findFiles is vulnerable
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Precondition:** Have VSCode with the Django extension installed. Open a Django project in VSCode. Create a Django HTML template file (e.g., `test.html`) within the project.
    2.  **Malicious Input:** In the `test.html` file, add the following line within the template code (e.g., inside `{% block content %}` or anywhere Django template syntax is valid):
        ```html
        {% include '../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd' %}
        ```
        or
        ```html
        {% extends '../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd' %}
        ```
    3.  **Trigger Vulnerability:** In VSCode, open the `test.html` file. Place the cursor on the malicious path `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` within the `include` or `extends` tag.
    4.  **Initiate "Go to Definition":** Press `F12` or Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on macOS) to trigger the "Go to Definition" functionality.
    5.  **Observe Behavior:**
        - **Expected (Without Vulnerability):**  The "Go to Definition" should either fail to find a definition (as `/etc/passwd` is unlikely to be a Django template) or should only search within the intended template directories and not navigate to `/etc/passwd`.
        - **Vulnerable Behavior:** If the extension attempts to navigate to or open `/etc/passwd` (or a file system location outside the project's template directories), it indicates a path traversal vulnerability. VSCode might show an error if it cannot open `/etc/passwd` as a text file, but even attempting to access it is a sign of the vulnerability.
    6.  **Verification:** Check the VSCode output or developer console for any errors or logs that indicate file access attempts outside the project's intended template directories. Observe if VSCode attempts to open a file path that corresponds to the traversal attempt (even if it fails to display it correctly).
