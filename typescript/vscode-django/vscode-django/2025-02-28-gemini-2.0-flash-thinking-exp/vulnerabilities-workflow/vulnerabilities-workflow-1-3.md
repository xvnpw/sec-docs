### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Path Traversal in Template Path Resolution

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a Django template file within a VSCode workspace.
    2. In this template file, the attacker includes a template tag like `{% include "../../../sensitive_file.txt" %}` or `{% extends "../../../sensitive_file.html" %}`. The path component `../../../sensitive_file.txt` is designed to traverse directories upwards from the expected template directories.
    3. The attacker then uses the "Go to Definition" feature (Ctrl+click or F12) on the path within the `include` or `extends` tag.
    4. The `TemplatePathProvider` in `src/providers/definitionProvider.ts` extracts the path `../../../sensitive_file.txt`.
    5. The extension uses `vscode.workspace.findFiles` with a search pattern like `**/{templates,jinja2}/../../../sensitive_file.txt` to locate the template file.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization of the path and the nature of glob patterns used by `findFiles`, path traversal sequences like `../` are not effectively neutralized.
    7. If a file at the traversed path (e.g., `sensitive_file.txt` located relative to the workspace root) exists and is accessible, VSCode will navigate to and open this file, effectively allowing access to files outside the intended template directories.

* Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files within the user's VSCode workspace that the VSCode process has permissions to access. This could include sensitive source code, configuration files, or data files, depending on the workspace structure and file system permissions.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the extracted path in `workspace.findFiles` without any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.

* Missing mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization**: Implement sanitization of the extracted path to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
    - **Restricted Search Scope**: Modify the search pattern in `workspace.findFiles` to strictly limit the search to the intended template directories and prevent directory traversal outside of these boundaries. For example, instead of using `**/{templates,jinja2}/${path}`, a safer approach might involve resolving the workspace's template directories and then using a more constrained search within those directories.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to open a VSCode workspace containing a Django project and a malicious Django template file.
    - The user must have the Django extension for VSCode installed and activated.
    - The user must trigger the "Go to Definition" feature on a crafted path in an `include` or `extends` tag within the malicious template file.

* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/providers/definitionProvider.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { dirname, resolve } from 'path'
    import { ... workspace, ... } from 'vscode'
    import { DJANGO_HTML_SELECTOR, PYTHON_SELECTOR } from '../constants'

    // ...

    export class TemplatePathProvider implements DefinitionProvider {
        // ...
        private static getTemplate(document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<Uri | null> {

            let path: string
            let search: string
            let line = document.lineAt(position.line).text
            let match = line.match(PATH_RE) // Extracts path like "path/to/template.html"
            let relative_match = line.match(RELATIVE_PATH_RE) // Extracts relative path like "./path.html" or "../path.html"

            if (relative_match) {
                path = relative_match[1]
                search = workspace.asRelativePath(resolve(dirname(document.uri.path), path)) // Resolves relative path
            } else if (match) {
                path = match[1]
                search = `**/{templates,jinja2}/${path}` // Constructs search pattern with extracted path
            } else {
                return Promise.resolve(null)
            }

            // ...
            uri = workspace.findFiles(search, '', 1, token).then(results => { // Uses workspace.findFiles with potentially unsafe search pattern
                let result = results.length ? results[0] : null
                if (result) cache[search] = result
                return result
            })
            // ...
        }

        public provideDefinition(document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<Definition> {
            return TemplatePathProvider.getTemplate(document, position, token).then(template => {
                if (! template) return null
                return new Location(template, BEGIN_OF_FILE)
            })
        }
    }
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the `getTemplate` function where the `path` variable, extracted directly from the template file, is used to construct the `search` pattern for `workspace.findFiles` without any sanitization. This allows path traversal characters in `path` to be passed directly to `workspace.findFiles`, potentially leading to file access outside the intended directories.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode-django-test-workspace`.
    2. Inside `vscode-django-test-workspace`, create a file named `sensitive_file.txt` with the content `This is a sensitive file.`.
    3. Inside `vscode-django-test-workspace`, create a directory named `templates`.
    4. Inside `templates`, create a file named `index.html` with the following content:
        ```html
        {% include "../../../sensitive_file.txt" %}
        ```
    5. Open VSCode and open the `vscode-django-test-workspace` directory as a workspace.
    6. Open the `index.html` file in the editor.
    7. Place the cursor on the path `../../../sensitive_file.txt` within the `{% include ... %}` tag.
    8. Press `F12` or Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) to trigger "Go to Definition".
    9. Observe if VSCode navigates to and opens the `sensitive_file.txt` file.
    10. **Expected Result:** VSCode should navigate to and open `sensitive_file.txt`, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability. If VSCode navigates to `sensitive_file.txt`, the vulnerability is confirmed. If it fails to find definition or shows error, the vulnerability might be mitigated or not present.
