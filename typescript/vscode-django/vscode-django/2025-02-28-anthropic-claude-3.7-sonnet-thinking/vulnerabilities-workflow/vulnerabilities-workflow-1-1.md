# VULNERABILITIES

*No vulnerabilities matching the specified criteria were found.*

After examining the provided vulnerability (Path Traversal in Template Resolution), I've determined it doesn't meet all required criteria. While this vulnerability:
- Has a high severity rating
- Is valid and not fully mitigated
- Can be triggered by a malicious repository
- Is not a denial of service issue

It doesn't qualify as an RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection vulnerability. The Path Traversal vulnerability allows accessing sensitive files within the workspace, but doesn't directly enable arbitrary code execution or command injection. It's primarily an information disclosure vulnerability.

Therefore, the filtered list according to your specifications is empty.
