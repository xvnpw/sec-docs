- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Malicious YAML Content  
  **Description:**  
  The theme’s YAML source file (`dracula.yml`) is parsed in the build process using the function `load()` from the js‑yaml library with a schema extended to support a custom `!alpha` type. Because the parser uses the default (unsafe) schema rather than an explicitly safe subset, a crafted YAML payload (for example, one that injects a `__proto__` key) could pollute the JavaScript object prototype. An external attacker who can somehow supply a modified `dracula.yml` (for instance, by compromising the extension’s supply chain or replacing the local file) may inject malicious keys that alter the behavior of all objects in the extension context.  
  **Impact:**  
  Prototype pollution is a serious vulnerability. Once the global object prototype is polluted, the attacker may influence behavior throughout the extension and—depending on how VS Code processes theme data—could ultimately cause unexpected behavior or even lead to arbitrary code execution. This undermines the integrity of the VS Code environment and may lead to privilege escalation or further exploitation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The project reads the YAML file using js-yaml’s `load()` with an extended schema (including the custom `!alpha` type).  
  - The file is internally bundled with the extension and is not intended for user modification.  
  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no explicit sanitization of the deserialized YAML content (for example, removal of keys like `__proto__` or `constructor`).  
  - The code does not use a “safe” parsing method (for example, by using a safe schema such as js-yaml’s DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA or a manual whitelist) that would reject prototype‑polluting keys.  
  - There is no runtime validation to ensure that the contents of `dracula.yml` have not been tampered with before they are used.  
  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply a modified version of the `dracula.yml` file. This could occur if the extension’s update or supply chain integrity is compromised or if a local attack (for example, on an end user’s filesystem) replaces the file.  
  - The extension’s build or runtime process must call the vulnerable YAML parser (as is done in `/code/scripts/generate.js`).  
  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In `/code/scripts/generate.js`, the YAML file is loaded as follows:  
     ```js
     const yamlFile = await readFile(join(__dirname, '..', 'src', 'dracula.yml'), 'utf-8');
     const base = load(yamlFile, { schema });
     ```  
  2. Here, `schema` is defined by extending the library’s `DEFAULT_SCHEMA` with a custom type for `!alpha` but does not restrict other potentially dangerous YAML features such as prototype pollution.  
  3. If an attacker injects a payload such as:  
     ```yaml
     __proto__:
       polluted: "yes"
     ```  
     into `dracula.yml`, the call to `load()` will merge the malicious key into the resulting object—and, by extension, into the prototype of all plain objects.  
  4. Once polluted, throughout the extension (or even in VS Code if the polluted objects propagate), a check like `({}).polluted` would unexpectedly return `"yes"`, confirming that the object prototype was modified.  
  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create a malicious version of `dracula.yml` that includes a prototype‑polluting payload. For example, add the following at the top (or appropriately within) the YAML file:
     ```yaml
     __proto__:
       polluted: "yes"
     
     $schema: vscode://schemas/color-theme
     name: Dracula
     author: Zeno Rocha
     maintainers:
       - Derek P Sifford <dereksifford@gmail.com>
     ... (rest of valid theme configuration) ...
     ```
  2. Replace the original `dracula.yml` in the source with this malicious file.  
  3. Run the build/generation script by executing:
     ```bash
     node scripts/generate.js
     ```
  4. In a separate test script or Node REPL (in the same context where the theme is loaded), evaluate whether the global Object prototype has been polluted by checking:
     ```js
     console.log({}.polluted);
     ```
  5. If the output is `"yes"`, the test confirms that prototype pollution has occurred.
