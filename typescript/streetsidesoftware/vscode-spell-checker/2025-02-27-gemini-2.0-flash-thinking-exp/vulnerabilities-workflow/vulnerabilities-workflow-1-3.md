## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: File Path Display Issue - Malicious File Name Display
- Description: The VSCode extension was displaying file names without properly decoding them. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft malicious file names that, when displayed in the extension's UI, could mislead users or cause unintended actions due to misinterpretation of the file path. For example, a file name could be crafted to visually appear as a safe path while actually pointing to a different or more sensitive location.
    1. An attacker crafts a file with a malicious file name containing encoded characters that, when decoded and displayed, could be misleading. For example, the file name could contain unicode characters to spoof a path.
    2. A user opens a workspace or file containing this maliciously named file in VSCode.
    3. The Code Spell Checker extension, when processing and displaying information about this file (e.g., in error messages, spell check results, or UI elements showing file paths), displays the file name without proper decoding.
    4. The user, seeing the misleading file name in the extension's UI, might be tricked into believing they are interacting with a different file or location than they actually are.
- Impact: High
    - Misleading UI: Users might be shown deceptive file paths, making it difficult to understand the actual file being processed by the extension.
    - Potential for Social Engineering Attacks: Although not directly leading to code execution or data breach, this vulnerability could be leveraged in social engineering attacks. An attacker could trick users into performing unintended actions based on the misleading file path displayed by the extension.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Yes
    - The vulnerability is mitigated by decoding file names before displaying them. This was implemented in commit `546a28ce066a0b0b8374c5d36127a3c79c8fc8f4` as mentioned in the changelog entry for version 4.0.38: "decode file names before displaying them. ([#4104](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/issues/4104)) ([546a28c](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/commit/546a28ce066a0b0b8374c5d36127a3c79c8fc8f4))"
- Missing Mitigations: No, the vulnerability appears to be addressed by the mentioned commit.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace or file in VSCode.
    - The workspace or file must contain a file with a maliciously crafted file name that exploits the lack of decoding in the extension.
- Source code analysis:
    - To perform a detailed source code analysis, access to the source code is required.
    - Based on the changelog description "decode file names before displaying them", it's likely that the code was directly using the encoded file name for display purposes in the UI components of the extension.
    - The fix likely involves implementing a decoding function (e.g., URL decoding or similar depending on the encoding) before rendering the file names in the UI, ensuring that special characters and encoded sequences are properly translated to their intended representation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a file with a name that includes URL encoded characters or unicode characters that could be misleading when displayed (e.g.,  `%2e%2e%2fpath/to/safe/file.txt` or using unicode characters to visually alter the path).
    2. Open VSCode and load the workspace or folder containing this file.
    3. Trigger the Code Spell Checker extension to process this file. This might involve opening the file, or performing a spell check in the workspace.
    4. Observe the file name as displayed in the extension's UI elements, such as in any diagnostic messages, file lists, or tooltips provided by the extension.
    5. Before the mitigation, the file name should be displayed in its encoded or misleading form.
    6. After the mitigation (version 4.0.38 and later), the file name should be displayed correctly after decoding, representing the actual file path without misleading characters.
