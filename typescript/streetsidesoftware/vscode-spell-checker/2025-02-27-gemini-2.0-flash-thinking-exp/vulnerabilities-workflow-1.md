## Combined Vulnerability List

### Remote Dictionary URL Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Dictionary URL Injection
- **Description:**
    - The VSCode Spell Checker extension allows users to configure custom dictionaries, including remote dictionaries specified by a URL.
    - An attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL pointing to a crafted dictionary file.
    - If the extension doesn't properly validate and sanitize the provided URL and the content of the remote dictionary, it could lead to vulnerabilities.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker sets up a malicious web server.
        2. The attacker creates a malicious dictionary file hosted on this server.
        3. The attacker convinces a victim to add a custom dictionary to their VSCode Spell Checker configuration, using the malicious URL.
        4. When the extension loads this remote dictionary, it fetches content from the attacker's server.
        5. If the URL or the content is not properly handled, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues, such as information disclosure or configuration manipulation.
- **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure if the extension mishandles the malicious dictionary content or URL, or configuration manipulation. While full arbitrary code execution is less likely without further code analysis, the potential for data exfiltration or configuration compromise is still significant.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No mitigations are explicitly mentioned in the provided files, including the `CHANGELOG.md`, `FAQ.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, `PUBLISHING.md`, documentation files, design documents and website files, regarding remote dictionary URL validation or sanitization. Based on the analyzed files, there is no indication that this vulnerability has been addressed in recent updates.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust validation and sanitization of remote dictionary URLs to prevent injection attacks.
    - Implement security checks when fetching and parsing remote dictionary files to handle potentially malicious content gracefully.
    - Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) for any webview components involved in dictionary loading to restrict execution of scripts from external sources if applicable.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the VSCode Spell Checker extension installed.
    - The user must be willing to add a custom dictionary and be potentially tricked into using a malicious URL.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The file `/code/packages/client/CHANGELOG.md` shows feature addition "Custom Dictionaries" in version 1.9.0, confirming the feature exists.
    - The file `/code/packages/client/FAQ.md` and `/code/packages/client/docs/settings.md` provide documentation about settings, including custom dictionaries and URL paths, reinforcing the possibility of remote dictionary URLs.  Specifically, `docs/settings.md` mentions `cSpell.userWordsUrl`, `cSpell.wordsUrl`, `cSpell.ignoreWordsUrl`, indicating URL usage for dictionary-related settings.
    - The files in `packages/utils-disposables`, `packages/__locale-resolver`, `packages/json-rpc-api`, `packages/webview-api`, and `packages/client/src/Subscribables`, `packages/client/src/util` provide utility functions, API structures, and reactive programming components. While they are essential parts of the project, they do not directly reveal the code path for handling remote dictionaries.
    - Files like `/code/packages/client/src/webview/utilities/getUri.ts` and `/code/packages/client/src/webview/utilities/getNonce.ts` suggest the use of webviews and awareness of Content Security Policy (CSP). However, without seeing how these utilities are applied to remote dictionary loading, it's impossible to confirm if they effectively mitigate the URL injection vulnerability.
    - The file `/code/packages/webview-ui/src/main.ts` and related files indicate that the extension uses Svelte for its webview UI. If dictionary management or configuration is handled in the webview, vulnerabilities could arise from insecure handling of URLs or content within the webview context.
    - The files `/code/packages/webview-ui/src/state/store.ts` and `/code/packages/webview-ui/src/state/appState.ts` introduce state management for the webview UI using `ClientServerStore`. These files show how data is synchronized between the webview (client) and the extension (server) using JSON-RPC, as indicated by the import of `getClientApi` which is related to the `webview-rpc` package. If the configuration for custom dictionaries, including remote URLs, is managed through this state management system, it highlights the importance of sanitizing and validating data received from the client (potentially attacker-controlled webview) on the server side before processing or using it to fetch remote resources. The `ClientServerStore` and `ReadonlyClientServerStore` are used to manage application state and synchronize it between the client and server parts of the extension. The `appState.ts` shows how different parts of the application state like `logDebug`, `todos`, and `currentDocument` are managed. If dictionary settings are part of this state, any vulnerability in state update mechanism or lack of sanitization for URL related state could be exploited.
    - The files in `/code/packages/webview-rpc/` define the JSON-RPC communication layer used by the extension. `webview-rpc` package, particularly `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/webview/vscode.ts` and `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/webview/json-rpc.ts`, sets up the communication channel between the webview and the extension backend. This communication layer is crucial for features like custom dictionary configuration that might involve sending URLs from the webview to the extension. If the extension blindly trusts messages from the webview without proper validation, it could be vulnerable to injection attacks.
    - **New Finding:** The file `/code/packages/client/src/client/server/vfs.ts` contains functions `vfsStat`, `vfsReadDirectory`, and `vfsReadFile` which interact with the VSCode workspace file system API (`workspace.fs`). Specifically, `vfsReadFile` takes a `UriString` (which could be a URL) and uses `Uri.parse(href)` and `workspace.fs.readFile(uri)` to read file content. If the extension uses `vfsReadFile` to fetch remote dictionaries based on user-provided URLs without proper validation of the URL scheme and sanitization, it could be vulnerable to URL injection. An attacker could provide a malicious URL, and if the extension directly passes it to `vfsReadFile`, it might lead to unexpected behavior depending on how `workspace.fs.readFile` handles different URL schemes and potentially malicious content.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a controlled web server (e.g., using `python -m http.server` for a simple HTTP server).
    2. Create a malicious dictionary file (`malicious_dict.txt`) on your local server. For testing purposes, this file can contain simple text or attempt to include special characters or escape sequences that might be mishandled during parsing. To test for potential script execution within a webview (if applicable), the malicious dictionary could contain HTML or Javascript code, e.g., `</script><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    3. Configure the VSCode Spell Checker to use a custom dictionary with a URL pointing to your malicious dictionary file. For example, in `settings.json`:
        ```json
        "cSpell.customDictionaries": {
            "maliciousDict": {
                "name": "maliciousDict",
                "path": "http://localhost:8000/malicious_dict.txt"
            }
        }
        ```
        (Ensure your local server is running on port 8000 and serving the `malicious_dict.txt` file).
    4. Open a text file in VSCode and trigger spell checking.
    5. Observe if the extension successfully loads the dictionary from `http://localhost:8000/malicious_dict.txt`. You can use network monitoring tools (like browser developer tools or Wireshark if running VSCode in a network monitoring environment) to confirm the request.
    6. Analyze the extension's behavior. Check for errors, unexpected outputs, or any signs of misbehavior that could indicate a vulnerability when processing the content of `malicious_dict.txt`. Specifically:
        - If the dictionary content was designed to trigger an XSS (e.g., using `<img>` tag), observe if any script execution occurs or if HTML elements are rendered in the VSCode UI, which would be a strong indicator of a vulnerability.
        - Check for any attempts to load external resources from the malicious dictionary file if it contains URLs or links.
        - Monitor for any unexpected file system access or network requests initiated by the extension after loading the malicious dictionary.
        - **New Test:** Try to use different URL schemes like `file://`, `ftp://`, or data URLs to check how the extension handles them and if it's possible to bypass intended restrictions or trigger unexpected behavior. For example, try:
            ```json
            "cSpell.customDictionaries": {
                "maliciousDictFile": {
                    "name": "maliciousDictFile",
                    "path": "file:///path/to/local/malicious_dict.txt"
                },
                "maliciousDictData": {
                    "name": "maliciousDictData",
                    "path": "data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"
                }
            }
            ```
            and observe the extension's behavior.
    7. To test for potential configuration manipulation, try to inject content into the dictionary that could be misinterpreted as a configuration setting by the extension (though this is less likely given typical dictionary formats, it's worth considering if the parsing is not robust).
    8. If you have access to the extension's logs or debugging capabilities, examine them for any errors or unusual activity during dictionary loading and processing from the remote URL.

### Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious cspell Configuration Files

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious cspell Configuration Files
- **Description:**
    - Maliciously crafted cspell configuration files are parsed without sufficient runtime checks. An attacker who is able to supply or alter a configuration file (for example, via an update or remote configuration mechanism) may inject code that is subsequently evaluated by the extension.
    - **Step by step:** An attacker replaces a trusted configuration (or injects a new one) that includes code payloads. When the extension loads the configuration file it fails to enforce a strict schema or sanitize inputs and unknowingly evaluates the injected code.
- **Impact:**
    - The attacker may force the extension to execute arbitrary code in the host process. This can lead to a complete compromise of the user’s system by executing commands in the context under which VS Code runs.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Basic logging and pre‑validation of configuration contents are present during the configuration‑loading process. However, there is no deep inspection of the configuration’s schema or rigorous sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • Enforce a strict, cryptographically verified schema on configuration files.
    - • Fully sanitize and validate all configuration input without ever evaluating configuration data as code.
- **Preconditions:**
    - • An attacker must be in a position to supply or replace configuration files used by the extension.
    - • The configuration loader does not perform deep type checking or sandboxing before code evaluation.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Previous analysis (not repeated in these files) showed that the configuration loader does not inspect extra fields or enforce type checks. In the absence of robust schema validation, injected JavaScript payloads embedded in configuration fields may be executed.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment, replace a trusted cspell configuration file with one that contains an extra payload field (for example, an embedded function call or script string).
    2. Force the extension to reload the configuration.
    3. Monitor logs and system state for evidence that the injected code was executed (such as unexpected file writes or changes in application state).
    4. Verify that using a schema‐enforced and sanitized parser prevents execution of the unintended payload.

### Local File Disclosure via Unvalidated Dictionary Definitions in cspell Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Local File Disclosure via Unvalidated Dictionary Definitions in cspell Configuration
- **Description:**
    - The cspell configuration permits the definition of dictionary sources as file paths or URLs. If these definitions are not strictly validated, a malicious configuration may point to arbitrary files on the local filesystem.
    - **Step by step:** An attacker supplies a configuration where a dictionary’s URI points to a sensitive file (for instance, a system password file or a configuration file from another application). When the extension reads this URI in order to load a dictionary, it inadvertently discloses sensitive file contents.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker may trick the extension into reading and disclosing the contents of sensitive local files, compromising the confidentiality of the user’s system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension relies on the default VS Code filesystem APIs and logs file accesses. No explicit verification restricts dictionary definitions to approved directories or safe URI schemes.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • Validate and strictly restrict dictionary paths to pre‑approved directories or safe file URI schemes.
    - • Enforce comprehensive path normalization and reject any URIs that could resolve to sensitive local files.
- **Preconditions:**
    - • The attacker must be capable of modifying or supplying a cspell configuration file.
    - • The extension processes supplied dictionary file paths directly via its file‑access routines without additional sanitization.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Earlier analyses showed that raw URI strings (supplied via the configuration) are passed directly to file‑access routines without checks. No dedicated routine ensures that URIs resolve only to safe locations.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test setup, modify the cspell configuration so that a dictionary’s URI points to a known sensitive file (e.g. a system file or a file outside the allowed directories).
    2. Trigger a configuration reload and observe whether the file’s contents are read and become visible in the extension’s output or logs.
    3. Confirm that proper path validation logic prevents reading such files.

### Predictable Nonce Generation in Webview Utilities

- **Vulnerability Name:** Predictable Nonce Generation in Webview Utilities
- **Description:**
    - The extension uses a helper function (located in the webview utilities module) to generate a nonce for enforcing a Content Security Policy (CSP) within webviews. This nonce is generated by looping a fixed number of times (typically 32 iterations) over a set of allowed characters using JavaScript’s insecure `Math.random()` function.
    - **Step by step:** Each time a nonce is needed, the function loops and chooses characters using `Math.random()`. Because `Math.random()` is not cryptographically secure, an attacker with sufficient observation or influence over the webview context may predict future nonce values and then craft malicious scripts that bypass the CSP.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker may be able to inject and execute malicious scripts in the webview, bypassing the intended CSP. This can lead to cross‑site scripting (XSS) attacks and potentially further compromise the extension’s host environment.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The nonce generation function uses a simple loop with `Math.random()` and does not incorporate any additional sources of entropy or leverage cryptographic functions.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (for example, Node’s `crypto.randomBytes` or the browser’s `crypto.getRandomValues`) to generate the nonce.
    - • Increase the nonce length or incorporate additional randomness to make prediction infeasible.
- **Preconditions:**
    - • The attacker must be in a position to either observe multiple nonce values or otherwise learn the pattern of nonce generation.
    - • The webview relies exclusively on these nonce values to authorize script execution without further safeguards.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Although the new batch of files does not directly include the nonce‐generation module, past analysis indicates that in `/code/packages/client/src/webview/utilities/getNonce.ts` the nonce is generated via 32 iterations using `Math.random()` over a string of allowed characters. The absence of cryptographic randomness means that nonce values are predictable over repeated invocations.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In an isolated environment, repeatedly invoke the nonce generation function and record the generated values.
    2. Perform a statistical analysis to determine if predictable patterns emerge.
    3. Attempt to predict a future nonce from observed sequences.
    4. Craft an HTML snippet for a test webview that includes a script tag with the predicted nonce and observe whether the script executes.
    5. Verify that a secure nonce generator (when applied) prevents this prediction.

### Insufficient Input Validation in JSON‑RPC API Request Handlers

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Input Validation in JSON‑RPC API Request Handlers
- **Description:**
    - The extension uses JSON‑RPC for communication between the extension and its webview(s). In the updated modules, the RPC endpoints are implemented in both the webview context (e.g. in `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/webview/json-rpc.ts`) and the extension context (e.g. in `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/extension/json-rpc.ts`). In both cases, incoming messages (received via `postMessage` or via the VS Code webview API) are forwarded directly to handler functions without rigorous runtime schema validation or sanitization.
    - **Step by step:** An attacker who is able to inject or manipulate RPC messages can send JSON‑RPC requests with unexpected types or malicious payloads. These messages are received by the message readers (see, for example, the `WebViewMessageReader` in the webview and extension modules) which only check for the existence of a data payload (checking `if (!data || !data.data) return;`) and then directly pass the data to registered handlers.
- **Impact:**
    - Maliciously crafted RPC messages may cause unintended behavior, including corruption of the internal state or (in worst‑case scenarios) triggering execution flows that lead to arbitrary code execution. This compromises both the integrity of data and the security of the extension runtime.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The current implementations log incoming requests and rely on the assumption that the underlying VS Code message channel is secure. No dedicated schema validation, strict type‑checking, or sanitization is applied to the RPC payloads.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • Implement runtime validations using a robust schema validation library to check the structure and types of all incoming JSON‑RPC messages.
    - • Enforce authentication or source verification on incoming messages to ensure that only trusted endpoints can communicate with the extension.
- **Preconditions:**
    - • The attacker must gain the ability to send or inject JSON‑RPC messages into the extension’s communication channel (for example, via a compromised webview or misconfigured postMessage source).
    - • The extension is currently operating under the assumption that the message channel is trusted, without performing its own validation.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/webview/json-rpc.ts` the `WebViewMessageReader` sets up a listener on the VS Code message API. The listener checks only for the existence of a `data` property and then calls the callback with `data.data` without further inspection. Similarly, in `/code/packages/webview-rpc/src/extension/json-rpc.ts` the RPC request handlers (registered via `connection.onRequest`) directly pass the received parameters to internal functions. There is no checking to confirm that these parameters conform to expected schemas.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a test instance of the extension in a sandboxed VS Code environment.
    2. Simulate the RPC message connection (both in the webview and extension contexts) using controlled injection or stubbing the underlying message channel.
    3. Send JSON‑RPC messages with unexpected data types, extra properties, or payloads designed to trigger edge‑case behavior in the JSON‑RPC handler functions.
    4. Observe the behavior of the extension for unintended state corruption, errors, or even execution of unexpected code paths.
    5. Confirm that implementation of strict input validation prevents processing of these malicious messages.

### File Path Display Issue - Malicious File Name Display

- **Vulnerability Name:** File Path Display Issue - Malicious File Name Display
- **Description:** The VSCode extension was displaying file names without properly decoding them. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft malicious file names that, when displayed in the extension's UI, could mislead users or cause unintended actions due to misinterpretation of the file path. For example, a file name could be crafted to visually appear as a safe path while actually pointing to a different or more sensitive location.
    1. An attacker crafts a file with a malicious file name containing encoded characters that, when decoded and displayed, could be misleading. For example, the file name could contain unicode characters to spoof a path.
    2. A user opens a workspace or file containing this maliciously named file in VSCode.
    3. The Code Spell Checker extension, when processing and displaying information about this file (e.g., in error messages, spell check results, or UI elements showing file paths), displays the file name without proper decoding.
    4. The user, seeing the misleading file name in the extension's UI, might be tricked into believing they are interacting with a different file or location than they actually are.
- **Impact:** High
    - Misleading UI: Users might be shown deceptive file paths, making it difficult to understand the actual file being processed by the extension.
    - Potential for Social Engineering Attacks: Although not directly leading to code execution or data breach, this vulnerability could be leveraged in social engineering attacks. An attacker could trick users into performing unintended actions based on the misleading file path displayed by the extension.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Yes
    - The vulnerability is mitigated by decoding file names before displaying them. This was implemented in commit `546a28ce066a0b0b8374c5d36127a3c79c8fc8f4` as mentioned in the changelog entry for version 4.0.38: "decode file names before displaying them. ([#4104](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/issues/4104)) ([546a28c](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/commit/546a28ce066a0b0b8374c5d36127a3c79c8fc8f4))"
- **Missing Mitigations:** No, the vulnerability appears to be addressed by the mentioned commit.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must open a workspace or file in VSCode.
    - The workspace or file must contain a file with a maliciously crafted file name that exploits the lack of decoding in the extension.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - To perform a detailed source code analysis, access to the source code is required.
    - Based on the changelog description "decode file names before displaying them", it's likely that the code was directly using the encoded file name for display purposes in the UI components of the extension.
    - The fix likely involves implementing a decoding function (e.g., URL decoding or similar depending on the encoding) before rendering the file names in the UI, ensuring that special characters and encoded sequences are properly translated to their intended representation.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a file with a name that includes URL encoded characters or unicode characters that could be misleading when displayed (e.g.,  `%2e%2e%2fpath/to/safe/file.txt` or using unicode characters to visually alter the path).
    2. Open VSCode and load the workspace or folder containing this file.
    3. Trigger the Code Spell Checker extension to process this file. This might involve opening the file, or performing a spell check in the workspace.
    4. Observe the file name as displayed in the extension's UI elements, such as in any diagnostic messages, file lists, or tooltips provided by the extension.
    5. Before the mitigation, the file name should be displayed in its encoded or misleading form.
    6. After the mitigation (version 4.0.38 and later), the file name should be displayed correctly after decoding, representing the actual file path without misleading characters.
