**Threat Model: Compromising Application via node-redis - High-Risk Sub-Tree**

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to application data, disrupt application functionality, or execute arbitrary code within the application's environment by leveraging vulnerabilities related to `node-redis`.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application via node-redis

                *   Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE]
                *   Data Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]
                *   Lua Script Injection (if enabled) [CRITICAL NODE]
                *   Module Loading (if enabled and vulnerable) [CRITICAL NODE]

        *   Sensitive Data Stored in Redis Without Proper Encryption [CRITICAL NODE if present]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Connection Issues -> Misconfiguration of Connection Parameters**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target applications where Redis connection details are insecurely managed.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive Redis credentials (username and password) are directly embedded within the application's source code or configuration files.
        *   **How it works:** Attackers can gain access to the source code or configuration files through various means (e.g., exposed Git repositories, insecure servers, insider threats). Once found, these credentials provide direct access to the Redis instance.
    *   **Weak or Default Password [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** The Redis instance is protected by a password that is easily guessable (e.g., "password", "123456") or is the default password set by the Redis installation.
        *   **How it works:** Attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to try common passwords against the Redis authentication mechanism. If successful, they gain unauthorized access.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where user-provided data is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization.
    *   **Unsanitized User Input in Redis Commands [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** The application constructs Redis commands by directly concatenating user-supplied input. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary Redis commands.
        *   **How it works:** By crafting malicious input, attackers can insert commands that are executed by the Redis server with the application's privileges.
            *   **Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers can use commands like `CONFIG GET dir` to find the Redis server's working directory and then use `SAVE` or `BGSAVE` to write data to a file in a location they control.
            *   **Data Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers can use commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `FLUSHDB`, or `FLUSHALL` to modify, delete, or completely erase data stored in Redis.
            *   **Lua Script Injection (if enabled) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If Lua scripting is enabled on the Redis server, attackers can inject malicious Lua scripts using the `EVAL` or `EVALSHA` commands to execute arbitrary code within the Redis server's context.
            *   **Module Loading (if enabled and vulnerable) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If Redis modules are enabled and the server is vulnerable, attackers can use the `MODULE LOAD` command to load malicious modules, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in node-redis (if vulnerable version is used)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target applications using outdated or vulnerable versions of the `node-redis` library.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in node-redis Library [CRITICAL NODE if present]:**
        *   **Description:** The `node-redis` library itself might contain publicly known vulnerabilities (identified by CVEs).
        *   **How it works:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specific inputs or triggering certain sequences of actions that exploit flaws in the library's code. This could lead to various impacts, including denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution within the application's process.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Data Handling (if sensitive data is unencrypted)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target applications that store sensitive data in Redis without proper encryption.
    *   **Sensitive Data Stored in Redis Without Proper Encryption [CRITICAL NODE if present]:**
        *   **Description:** The application stores sensitive information (e.g., user credentials, personal data, financial details) directly in the Redis database without encrypting it.
        *   **How it works:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance (through compromised credentials, command injection, or other means), they can directly read the sensitive data stored in plain text.
