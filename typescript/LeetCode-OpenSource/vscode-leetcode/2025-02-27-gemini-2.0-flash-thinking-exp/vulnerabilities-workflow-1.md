### Combined Vulnerability List:

This document outlines the vulnerabilities identified in the LeetCode VSCode extension, combining information from the provided lists and removing duplicates.

* Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Filename in `testSolution` and `submitSolution`

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Filename in `testSolution` and `submitSolution`
- Description:
    1. An attacker can create a file with a malicious filename. For example, a filename could be crafted like `pwn$(touch /tmp/pwned).js` or  `evil.js" && echo HACKED && "`.
    2. When the user attempts to test or submit this file using the LeetCode extension, the filename is passed unsanitized to the `leetcode test` or `leetcode submit` command within `leetCodeExecutor.ts`.
    3. If the filename contains shell-escaped characters or commands, these could be executed by the underlying shell when the extension executes the LeetCode CLI. This is because the command is executed with shell interpretation enabled (`shell: true`).
    4. For example, a filename like `pwn$(touch /tmp/pwned).js` could execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command on a Linux/macOS system, or `evil.js" && echo HACKED && "` could execute `echo HACKED` on any system during test or submission.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. Successful exploitation can lead to critical consequences such as:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data can be stolen from the user's system.
    - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware, including ransomware or spyware.
    - System compromise: Full control over the user's system can be achieved, leading to further attacks or data breaches.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The filename, obtained from the active file path, is directly passed to the shell command without any sanitization or escaping. While the file path is wrapped in double quotes in some cases, this is insufficient to prevent command injection due to the use of `shell: true` and the potential for various shell metacharacters to bypass quoting.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Sanitize or validate filenames:**  Filenames should be rigorously sanitized or validated to remove or neutralize shell-special characters before being passed to shell commands.
    - **Use parameterized commands or direct function calls:** Where possible, replace shell execution with safer process-execution APIs like `execFile` that allow passing arguments as an array, preventing shell interpretation.
    - **Properly escape filenames:** If shell execution is necessary, filenames must be properly escaped or quoted when constructing shell commands to prevent shell injection. Simply wrapping in double quotes is not sufficient.
    - **Input validation:** Implement input validation to restrict characters allowed in filenames within the workspace, although this might be less practical for existing workspaces.
- Preconditions:
    - **Malicious Filename Creation:** The attacker needs to trick the user into creating or downloading a file with a malicious filename within their workspace. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or compromised repositories.
    - **User Action:** The user must open the file with the malicious filename in VSCode, making it the active document.
    - **Extension Usage:** The user must then trigger either the "LeetCode: Test Current File" or "LeetCode: Submit Current File" command using the LeetCode extension.
    - **Shell Execution:** The underlying command execution must be performed using `shell: true`, which is the case in the identified code.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/leetCodeExecutor.ts`
    - Functions: `submitSolution(filePath: string)`, `testSolution(filePath: string, testString?: string)`
    - Code Snippets:
      ```typescript
      public async submitSolution(filePath: string): Promise<string> {
          try {
              return await this.executeCommandWithProgressEx("Submitting to LeetCode...", this.nodeExecutable, [await this.getLeetCodeBinaryPath(), "submit", `"${filePath}"`]);
          } catch (error) {
              if (error.result) {
                  return error.result;
              }
              throw error;
          }
      }

      public async testSolution(filePath: string, testString?: string): Promise<string> {
          if (testString) {
              return await this.executeCommandWithProgressEx("Submitting to LeetCode...", this.nodeExecutable, [await this.getLeetCodeBinaryPath(), "test", `"${filePath}"`, "-t", `${testString}`]);
          }
          return await this.executeCommandWithProgressEx("Submitting to LeetCode...", this.nodeExecutable, [await this.getLeetCodeBinaryPath(), "test", `"${filePath}"`]);
      }

      private async executeCommandWithProgressEx(message: string, command: string, args: string[], options: cp.SpawnOptions = { shell: true }): Promise<string> {
          if (wsl.useWsl()) {
              return await executeCommandWithProgress(message, "wsl", [command].concat(args), options);
          }
          return await executeCommandWithProgress(message, command, args, options);
      }
      ```
    - Visualization:

      ```
      User -> Malicious Filename Input -> submitSolution/testSolution -> executeCommandWithProgressEx (shell: true) -> Shell Command Execution
      ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow:** The `filePath` parameter in `submitSolution` and `testSolution` functions directly originates from user-controlled file names in the workspace. This `filePath` is incorporated into command arguments for `executeCommandWithProgressEx`. The critical issue is that `executeCommandWithProgressEx` (and subsequently `executeCommandEx` and `executeCommand`) utilizes `cp.spawn` with the option `shell: true`. This setting instructs `cp.spawn` to execute commands through a shell interpreter (like bash, sh, or cmd.exe). When `shell: true` is used, the first argument is treated as a command string, and any subsequent arguments are passed as shell arguments, but crucially, the shell performs word splitting and command substitution on the entire command string.  The double quotes around `"${filePath}"` are intended for quoting, but they are insufficient to prevent command injection in all scenarios when `shell: true` is enabled, especially when filenames contain characters like backticks, dollar signs, semicolons, or quotes themselves.  Because of the `shell: true` option, a maliciously crafted filename can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the user's shell.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create Malicious File:** In a VSCode workspace, create a new file named `pwn$(touch /tmp/pwned).js` (for Linux/macOS) or `pwn&echo pwned > pwned.txt.js` (for Windows).
    2. **Add Code:** Add any valid Javascript code to the file (e.g., `console.log("test");`).
    3. **Trigger Command:** In VSCode, with the malicious file active, use the LeetCode extension command "LeetCode: Test Current File" or "LeetCode: Submit Current File".
    4. **Verify Exploitation (Linux/macOS):** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. If it exists, command injection is successful.
    5. **Verify Exploitation (Windows):** Check if `pwned.txt` is created in the workspace directory. If it exists, command injection is successful.


* Vulnerability 2: Command Injection via Test String in `testSolution`

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Test String in `testSolution`
- Description:
    1. When a user uses the "LeetCode: Test Current File" command and selects the "Write directly..." option, they are prompted to enter custom test cases.
    2. The provided test string is intended to be used as input for the LeetCode problem's testing. However, this test string is passed unsanitized to the `leetcode test` command within `leetCodeExecutor.ts`.
    3. Similar to the filename vulnerability, if the test string contains shell-escaped characters or commands, these malicious commands could be executed by the underlying shell.
    4. For example, a test string like `; touch /tmp/pwned2` or `'; echo HACKED; '` can execute the `touch /tmp/pwned2` or `echo HACKED` commands respectively.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process, mirroring the impact of the filename command injection vulnerability. This can lead to data breaches, malware installation, and system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The test string input is wrapped in quotes (single quotes on Unix-like systems, double quotes on Windows when using CMD) by the `parseTestString` function, but this quoting is insufficient to prevent command injection when the input itself contains shell metacharacters, especially quotes.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Sanitize or validate test string input:** The test string input should be sanitized or validated to remove or escape shell-special characters.
    - **Use parameterized commands:** Employ process-execution APIs like `execFile` to avoid shell interpretation and pass arguments as an array.
    - **Properly escape test string:** If shell execution is unavoidable, the test string must be rigorously escaped to prevent command injection. Simple quoting is not sufficient.
    - **Input validation:** Implement stricter input validation on the test case input field to limit potentially dangerous characters.
- Preconditions:
    - **User Interaction:** The user must trigger the "LeetCode: Test Current File" command.
    - **"Write directly..." Option:** The user must choose the "Write directly..." option when prompted for test cases, which leads to the input box for custom test cases.
    - **Malicious Test String:** The user must enter a malicious test string containing shell commands. This could be intentionally done by an attacker who has gained access to the user's VSCode environment, or through social engineering by tricking the user into entering a malicious string.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/leetCodeExecutor.ts` and `/code/src/commands/test.ts`
    - Function: `testSolution(filePath: string, testString?: string)` in `leetCodeExecutor.ts`, `parseTestString` in `test.ts`
    - Code Snippets (`test.ts` - `parseTestString`):
      ```typescript
      export function parseTestString(test: string): string {
          if (process.platform === "win32" && process.env.COMSPEC?.toLowerCase().endsWith("powershell.exe")) { // powershell
              return `"${test.replace(/"/g, '""')}"`;
          } else if (process.platform === "win32") { // cmd
              return `"${test}"`;
          } else { // unix like bash, zsh
              return `'${test}'`;
          }
      }
      ```
    - Visualization:

      ```
      User -> Malicious Test String Input -> test.ts (parseTestString - insufficient quoting) -> testSolution -> executeCommandWithProgressEx (shell: true) -> Shell Command Execution
      ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow:** When the "Write directly..." option is selected for test cases, the `testString` variable is populated from user input via `vscode.window.showInputBox`. This `testString` is then processed by `parseTestString` which attempts to quote the string, but does not properly escape embedded quotes or other shell metacharacters. For Unix-like systems, it uses single quotes: `'${test}'`. For Windows, it uses double quotes, with a specific case for PowerShell that attempts to escape double quotes by replacing them with two double quotes, but this is also likely incomplete.  The insufficiently quoted `testString` is then passed to the `testSolution` function in `leetCodeExecutor.ts`, which embeds it within the `leetcode test` command. Because `executeCommandWithProgressEx` uses `shell: true`, the shell interprets the command string, leading to command injection if the `testString` contains malicious shell commands that bypass the simple quoting applied by `parseTestString`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Trigger Test Command:** Open any LeetCode problem file in VSCode. Use the LeetCode extension command "LeetCode: Test Current File".
    2. **Choose "Write directly..."**: Select the "Write directly..." option when prompted for test cases.
    3. **Enter Malicious Test Case:** In the input box, enter the following test case: `; touch /tmp/pwned2` (for Linux/macOS) or `; echo pwned2 > pwned2.txt` (for Windows).
    4. **Submit Test Case:** Click "Enter" or submit the input.
    5. **Verify Exploitation (Linux/macOS):** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned2` is created. If it exists, command injection is successful.
    6. **Verify Exploitation (Windows):** Check if `pwned2.txt` is created in the workspace directory. If it exists, command injection is successful.


* Vulnerability 3: Cross–Site Scripting (XSS) in LeetCode Solution Webview

- Vulnerability Name: Cross–Site Scripting (XSS) in LeetCode Solution Webview
- Description:
    1. When the LeetCode extension displays a problem solution in its custom webview, it fetches solution data which includes fields like title, body, and other metadata.
    2. The extension uses the `parseSolution` function in `leetCodeSolutionProvider.ts` to process the raw solution string.
    3. The solution body, which is in Markdown format, is rendered into HTML using a markdown rendering engine. Crucially, the raw, unsanitized solution body is passed to the markdown renderer.
    4. If an attacker can manipulate the solution data (e.g., by compromising the LeetCode server or through a man-in-the-middle attack), they can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript payloads into the solution body. For example, injecting an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute.
    5. The rendered HTML, including the attacker's payload, is then inserted into the webview without any further sanitization.
- Impact: Successful XSS exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the extension's webview. While the webview has a Content Security Policy (CSP), bypassing CSP is sometimes possible, and even within CSP limitations, significant risks remain:
    - Phishing attacks: Malicious scripts can be used to create fake login prompts or other UI elements to steal user credentials.
    - Data exfiltration: Even with CSP, certain data within the webview or accessible by the extension might be exfiltrated.
    - Content manipulation: The displayed solution and other webview content can be manipulated to mislead or trick the user.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A restrictive CSP is embedded in the generated HTML for the webview. This CSP includes directives like `default-src 'none'`, `img-src https:`, `script-src vscode-resource:`, and `style-src vscode-resource:`. While CSP provides a layer of defense, it is not a foolproof mitigation against XSS, especially if there are CSP bypasses or if the attack focuses on actions permissible within the CSP.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Sanitize solution content:**  The solution content, especially the solution body, must be sanitized and escaped to remove or neutralize any potentially dangerous HTML tags or attributes *before* it is passed to the markdown renderer.
    - **HTML Sanitization Post-Markdown Rendering:**  Alternatively, or in addition to sanitizing the Markdown source, the HTML output from the markdown engine should be rigorously sanitized using a robust HTML sanitization library to remove or disable any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript constructs.
    - **Secure Markdown Engine Configuration:** Ensure the markdown engine itself is configured to escape raw HTML by default, or if it allows raw HTML, ensure it is followed by sanitization.
- Preconditions:
    - **Malicious Solution Data:** The attacker must be able to control or modify the solution data fetched by the extension. This could be achieved by:
        - Compromising the remote LeetCode server or its API.
        - Performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify the solution data in transit between the LeetCode server and the user's machine.
    - **User Action:** The user must trigger the "LeetCode: Show Solution" command or otherwise view a solution in the extension's webview. This action causes the malicious solution data to be processed and rendered within the webview.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/webview/leetCodeSolutionProvider.ts`
    - Functions: `parseSolution(raw: string)`, `getWebviewContent()`
    - Code Snippets (`leetCodeSolutionProvider.ts`):
      ```typescript
      public parseSolution(raw: string): ISolution {
          // ... parsing logic ...
          solution.body = rawBody; // rawBody is assigned from unsanitized content
          // ...
          return solution;
      }

      public getWebviewContent(): string {
          // ...
          const body: string = markdownEngine.render(this.solution.body, { // Unsanitized solution.body passed to renderer
              lang: this.solution.lang,
              host: "https://discuss.leetcode.com/",
          });
          // ... construct HTML template and insert head, info, body without sanitization ...
          return html;
      }
      ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow:** The `parseSolution` function processes the raw solution data and extracts the `solution.body` directly from the unsanitized input. Subsequently, in `getWebviewContent`, this `this.solution.body` is passed directly to `markdownEngine.render()` without any sanitization. The HTML output from the markdown renderer is then embedded into the webview's HTML content. Because no sanitization is performed on the solution body before or after markdown rendering, any malicious HTML or JavaScript embedded in the solution body will be executed within the webview context. The extension trusts the solution string completely, making it vulnerable to XSS if the solution data source is compromised or attacker-controlled.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Craft Malicious Solution String:** Create a mock solution string that includes a malicious payload in the solution body. For example, embed the following HTML snippet within the solution body part of the mock solution string: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    2. **Simulate Solution Display:**  Use the extension’s “Show Solution” command and somehow provide this crafted solution data to be rendered (this might require mocking network responses or directly manipulating the extension's state for testing purposes).
    3. **Observe Webview:** When the webview is rendered with the crafted solution, observe if the JavaScript payload executes. For example, check if an alert box with "XSS" pops up.
    4. **Verify XSS:** If the payload executes, it confirms that XSS is possible. Verify that the injected script is running in the context of the webview and that the payload was not sanitized or blocked by the CSP in a way that prevents execution.
