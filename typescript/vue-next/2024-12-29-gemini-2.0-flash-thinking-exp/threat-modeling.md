### High and Critical Vue.js (vue-next) Threats

This list details high and critical severity security threats that directly involve the Vue.js (vue-next) framework.

*   **Threat:** Template Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into Vue templates through user-controlled data that is not properly sanitized. The Vue template compiler then renders this script, causing it to execute in the victim's browser. This can happen when using `v-html` or when server-side rendered content is not properly escaped by Vue's rendering mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Template Compiler
        *   `v-html` directive
        *   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) module (specifically Vue's SSR implementation)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `v-html` with user-provided content.** If necessary, sanitize the content rigorously using a trusted library *before* it reaches Vue's rendering process.
        *   **Use `v-text` or text interpolation (`{{ }}`) for displaying user-provided text content.** These methods automatically escape HTML entities by Vue.
        *   **Implement proper output encoding (HTML escaping) on the server-side when using SSR.** Ensure Vue's SSR configuration is set up to escape user-generated content before being included in the initial HTML.
        *   **Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources.** This can help mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Data Binding (if Vue's reactivity system is directly involved)
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates data bound to the Vue instance in a way that directly exploits vulnerabilities within Vue's reactivity system to modify the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. This is less common but could occur if there are undiscovered vulnerabilities in how Vue handles object properties.
    *   **Impact:**  Application malfunction, potential security bypasses, and in some cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Reactivity System
        *   Vue Instance
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party libraries used in conjunction with Vue's reactivity system.** Keep dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities that might interact with Vue's reactivity.
        *   **Implement input validation and sanitization for all data bound to the Vue instance, especially data received from external sources.** This helps prevent malicious data from reaching Vue's reactivity system.
        *   **While less direct, ensure secure coding practices are followed to avoid unintentionally manipulating prototypes in ways that could interact negatively with Vue's internal mechanisms.**

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Server-Side Rendered (SSR) State leading to XSS
    *   **Description:** When using SSR, vulnerabilities in Vue's server-side rendering process can lead to Cross-Site Scripting if user input is not properly sanitized *by Vue's SSR mechanisms* before rendering. This results in malicious scripts being included in the initial HTML payload.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential for XSS attacks that are rendered on the server and executed on the client.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) module
        *   `createSSRApp` function
        *   `renderToString` function
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure proper HTML escaping of all dynamic content rendered on the server *by Vue's SSR functions*.** Verify that Vue's SSR configuration is correctly set up for escaping.
        *   **Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into the SSR template.**
        *   **Regularly audit the SSR implementation and Vue's SSR configuration for potential vulnerabilities.**
