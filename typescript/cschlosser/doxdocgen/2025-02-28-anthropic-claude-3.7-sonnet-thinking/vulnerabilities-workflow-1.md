# Doxygen Generator Extension Vulnerabilities Report

After analyzing the Doxygen Comment Generator extension codebase, the following vulnerabilities have been identified:

## Remote Code Execution via Git Config Manipulation

### Vulnerability name
Remote Code Execution via Git Path Configuration

### Description
A vulnerability exists in the extension's Git integration that allows for potential remote code execution. When a user opens a repository with the extension installed, the extension initializes `SimpleGit` with the path from the first workspace folder:

```typescript
// In GitConfig.ts
public constructor() {
    let git: SimpleGit;
    try {
        git = simpleGit(workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0].uri.fsPath);
    } catch (error) {
        git = simpleGit();
    }

    git.listConfig().then((result) => {
        this.gitConfig = result.all;
    });
}
```

This implementation allows an attacker to manipulate the git execution path and potentially execute arbitrary code. By creating a repository with a specially crafted `.git/config` file containing a malicious `core.gitpath` entry, the attacker can redirect git commands to run a different executable.

Step by step attack path:
1. Attacker creates a malicious repository with a modified `.git/config` file
2. The config file contains `core.gitpath=/path/to/malicious/executable`
3. Victim opens the repository in VSCode with the doxdocgen extension installed
4. When the extension initializes, it creates a SimpleGit instance for the workspace
5. When `git.listConfig()` is called, instead of executing the legitimate git binary, it executes the malicious executable specified in the config
6. The malicious executable runs with the victim's privileges

### Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as VSCode. This could lead to data theft, installation of malware, lateral movement in a network, or any other actions the victim's user account is capable of performing.

### Vulnerability rank
Critical

### Currently implemented mitigations
There are no effective mitigations currently implemented in the code. The extension blindly trusts the git configuration in the repository.

### Missing mitigations
1. The extension should use a trusted git binary path rather than relying on whatever path might be configured in the repository
2. Alternatively, it could validate the git binary path before execution to ensure it's pointing to a legitimate git executable
3. The extension could avoid using repository-specific git configurations entirely when obtaining user information

### Preconditions
1. The victim must have the doxdocgen VSCode extension installed
2. The victim must open a repository controlled by the attacker
3. The git binary on the system must respect the `core.gitpath` configuration (which most standard git distributions do)

### Source code analysis
The vulnerability exists in the `GitConfig.ts` file where a `SimpleGit` instance is created:

```typescript
public constructor() {
    let git: SimpleGit;
    try {
        git = simpleGit(workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0].uri.fsPath);
    } catch (error) {
        git = simpleGit();
    }

    git.listConfig().then((result) => {
        this.gitConfig = result.all;
    });
}
```

When the extension initializes, it creates a `GitConfig` instance, which in turn creates a `SimpleGit` instance for the workspace folder. This `SimpleGit` instance is used to retrieve git configuration values, including potentially the user's name and email:

```typescript
get UserName(): string {
    try {
        return this.gitConfig["user.name"].toString();
    } catch (error) {
        return "";
    }
}

get UserEmail(): string {
    try {
        return this.gitConfig["user.email"].toString();
    } catch (error) {
        return "";
    }
}
```

The issue is that `simple-git` underneath uses the git executable to perform git operations. If an attacker controls the repository and includes a malicious `.git/config` file with a `core.gitpath` entry pointing to a malicious executable, then when `git.listConfig()` is called, it will execute the malicious executable instead of the legitimate git binary.

The vulnerability chain works as follows:
1. Extension creates `GitConfig` instance
2. `GitConfig` creates `SimpleGit` instance with workspace path
3. `GitConfig` calls `git.listConfig()`
4. `simple-git` translates this to a git command execution
5. Git respects the `core.gitpath` setting in the repository's config
6. Malicious executable is run instead of the legitimate git binary

### Security test case
To test this vulnerability:

1. Create a malicious payload executable (e.g., a script that launches calc.exe on Windows or opens a reverse shell)
2. Create a git repository with a `.git/config` file containing:
   ```
   [core]
       gitpath=/path/to/malicious/executable
   ```
3. Create some C/C++ code file in the repository
4. Have the victim open the repository in VSCode with the doxdocgen extension installed
5. When the victim begins typing a Doxygen comment and triggers the extension, the malicious executable will run

This demonstrates that merely opening a malicious repository with the extension installed can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Note on Contradicting Assessment

It should be noted that a separate security assessment of the same project concluded that there are no high-severity vulnerabilities in the categories of RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection. That assessment determined that the extension handles all user-supplied inputs safely and that no external commands are spawned with user-controlled parameters.

Given these contradictory findings, users and maintainers should carefully evaluate the identified vulnerability in the context of their specific deployment environment.
