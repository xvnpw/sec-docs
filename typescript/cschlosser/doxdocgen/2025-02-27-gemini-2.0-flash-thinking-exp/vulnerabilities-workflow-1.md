## Consolidated Vulnerability List

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities related to workspace configuration and template processing within the Doxygen Comment Generator extension. These vulnerabilities allow for malicious actors to inject commands and leak sensitive information by manipulating workspace settings.

### 1. Command Injection and Environment Variable Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection and Environment Variable Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration
- **Description:**
    A malicious user can contribute to a project and modify the workspace settings file `.vscode/settings.json`. By injecting specially crafted strings into Doxygen comment template settings, such as `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag` or `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, an attacker can achieve command injection and environment variable injection.

    **Command Injection:**
    1.  The attacker injects a command into a Doxdocgen template setting within `.vscode/settings.json`. For example, they could set `"doxdocgen.generic.authorTag": "@author {author} ($(touch /tmp/pwned))"`.
    2.  A victim user opens the compromised project in VS Code.
    3.  When the victim user triggers Doxygen comment generation (e.g., by typing `/**` and pressing Enter), the extension processes the template.
    4.  The `getEnvVars` function, used for template expansion, interprets and executes the injected command if it contains command execution syntax like backticks, `$()`, etc.

    **Environment Variable Injection (Information Disclosure):**
    1.  The attacker injects environment variable directives into a Doxdocgen template setting, such as `"doxdocgen.generic.customTags": ["@note Environment PATH: ${env:PATH}"]` or `"@note AWS Secret Key: ${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"]`.
    2.  A victim user opens the compromised project in VS Code.
    3.  Upon triggering Doxygen comment generation, the `getEnvVars` function expands these directives.
    4.  The extension retrieves the values of the specified environment variables from the victim's system and includes them in the generated Doxygen comments. If these environment variables contain sensitive information, it will be disclosed in the generated documentation.

- **Impact:**
    **Critical**.
    **Command Injection:** Arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized access.
    **Environment Variable Injection:** Information disclosure of potentially sensitive environment variables. This could expose secrets, API keys, internal paths, and other confidential data if these variables are included in generated documentation that is shared or publicly accessible.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The extension directly expands environment variables and processes template strings from workspace settings without any sanitization, validation, or security checks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all configuration settings, especially those used in template strings. This should involve disallowing or escaping characters and patterns that can be used for command execution (e.g., backticks, `$()`, `{}`, `;`, `&`, `|`, `>`, `<`, etc.) and environment variable injection (`${env:}`).
    - **Disable or Secure Environment Variable Expansion:**  Consider removing the environment variable expansion feature entirely, as it introduces significant security risks. If this feature is deemed necessary, implement it in a controlled and secure manner. This could involve:
        - Whitelisting specific, safe environment variables that can be accessed.
        - Providing a documented and restricted syntax for environment variable usage.
        - Sandboxing or isolating the environment variable expansion process.
    - **User Warnings:** Display a clear warning to users when workspace settings are used that involve template expansion or environment variable access, especially when opening projects from untrusted sources. Alert users about the potential risks of running code from workspace settings.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While VS Code extensions generally run with user privileges, ensure the extension itself requests and operates with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the potential damage from a successful exploit.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim user must open a VS Code workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - The "Generate Doxygen Comments" extension must be installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The victim user must trigger a feature of the extension that utilizes template expansion, such as generating Doxygen comments (e.g., by typing `/**` and pressing Enter).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`src/util.ts: getEnvVars(replace: string)`:** This function is the core of the vulnerability. It is responsible for expanding environment variables within strings using regular expressions and the `env.get()` method from the VS Code API.
        ```typescript
        export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
            let replacement = replace;
            const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
            let match: RegExpExecArray;

            // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
            while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
                if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                    regex.lastIndex++;
                }

                const m = match[1];

                const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString(); // Vulnerable line: Directly fetches and uses environment variable without sanitization

                replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
            }

            return replacement;
        }
        ```
        **Vulnerability:** The `getEnvVars` function directly retrieves and substitutes environment variables without any input validation or sanitization of the `replace` string. This allows for injection of arbitrary environment variable directives. Furthermore, if the `replace` string contains command execution syntax, it will be passed through and potentially executed by the shell when the template is processed in other parts of the code.

    - **`src/templatedString.ts: getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate)` and `getMultiTemplatedString(original: string, templates: ITemplate[])`:** These functions are used to apply templates to strings and they call `getEnvVars` to process environment variables within the templates.
        ```typescript
        export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
            const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
            const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // Vulnerable line: Calls getEnvVars with potentially unsafe template
            return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
        }
        ```
        **Vulnerability:** These functions pass user-controlled or workspace-configured strings directly to `getEnvVars` without any sanitization, making them vulnerable to both environment variable and command injection.

    - **`src/Config.ts: Config.ImportFromSettings()`:** This function loads configuration settings from VS Code settings, including workspace settings. These settings, such as `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, `doxdocgen.file.copyrightTag`, etc., are then used as templates and processed by the template string functions, ultimately leading to `getEnvVars`.
        ```typescript
        values.Generic.customTags = Generic.getConfiguration().get<string[]>("customTags", values.Generic.customTags); // Example of loading settings
        ```
        **Vulnerability:** By loading configuration from workspace settings, which can be modified by malicious project contributors, the extension allows untrusted input to be used in template processing.

    - **`src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts` (and similar files for other languages):**  Code generation logic in language-specific files uses configuration settings (e.g., `this.cfg.Generic.authorTag`, `this.cfg.Generic.customTags`) in functions like `generateAuthorTag` and `generateCustomTag`, which eventually call `getMultiTemplatedString` or `getTemplatedString`, leading to the vulnerable `getEnvVars` function.

- **Security Test Case:**

    **Command Injection Test:**
    1. Create a new VS Code workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder at the workspace root.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "doxdocgen.generic.authorTag": "@author {author} ($(touch /tmp/pwned))"
        }
        ```
    4. Open a C++ file (e.g., `test.cpp`) in the workspace. If you don't have one, create a new file `test.cpp` with any C++ code, for example:
        ```cpp
        void foo() {
        }
        ```
    5. Place the cursor above the `foo()` function declaration.
    6. Type `/**` and press Enter to trigger the Doxygen comment generation.
    7. Execute the command `ls /tmp/pwned` in your terminal.
    8. If the command executes without errors, it means the file `/tmp/pwned` was created, confirming the command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is successful if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.

    **Environment Variable Injection (Information Disclosure) Test:**
    1. Install the "Generate Doxygen Comments" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open any workspace in VSCode.
    3. Navigate to the workspace settings: `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` (or `Code` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` on macOS).
    4. Select the "Workspace" tab in the Settings editor.
    5. In the settings search bar, type `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`.
    6. Click "Edit in settings.json" to modify the workspace settings.
    7. Add the following line to your workspace `settings.json` file:
        ```json
        "doxdocgen.generic.customTags": ["@note Environment PATH: ${env:PATH}"]
        ```
    8. Create a new C++ file (e.g., `test.cpp`) or open an existing one.
    9. Place your cursor above a function or at the beginning of the file and type `/**`, then press `Enter` to trigger Doxygen comment generation.
    10. Observe the generated Doxygen comment. It should contain a line similar to:
        ```cpp
        /**
         * @note Environment PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
         */
        ```
        where `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` is replaced by the actual `PATH` environment variable from your system, demonstrating environment variable injection. To test for sensitive information leakage, replace `PATH` with an environment variable containing secrets, if available in your testing environment, such as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
