### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability name: Command Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration
- Description:
    1. A malicious user contributes to a project and modifies the workspace settings file `.vscode/settings.json`.
    2. In `.vscode/settings.json`, the malicious user injects a command into a Doxdocgen template setting, such as `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`. For example, they set `"doxdocgen.generic.authorTag": "@author {author} ($(touch /tmp/pwned))"`.
    3. A victim user opens the compromised project in VS Code.
    4. The victim user triggers Doxygen comment generation using the extension (e.g., by typing `/**` and pressing Enter).
    5. The `getEnvVars` function expands the template string. If the injected command uses backticks, `$()`, or similar command execution syntax, it executes the malicious command on the victim's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly expands environment variables without any sanitization or security checks on the configuration values used as templates.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for all template settings to prevent command injection. This could involve disallowing characters or patterns that can be used for command execution (e.g., backticks, `$()`, `{}`, `;`, `&`, `|`, `>`, `<`, etc.).
    - Disable environment variable expansion: Consider removing or disabling the environment variable expansion feature entirely, as it introduces significant security risks. If this feature is necessary, explore safer alternatives.
    - User warnings: Display a clear warning to users when workspace settings are used that involve environment variable expansion, especially when opening projects from untrusted sources.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful command injection. However, this might not be fully effective as VS Code extensions generally run with user privileges.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim user must open a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - The Doxdocgen extension must be activated in VS Code.
    - The victim user must trigger a feature of the extension that uses template expansion, such as generating Doxygen comments.
- Source code analysis:
    1. `src/util.ts`: The `getEnvVars` function is responsible for environment variable expansion. It uses the `env-var` library but lacks any input validation or sanitization.
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }

            const m = match[1];

            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString(); // Vulnerable line: Directly fetches and uses environment variable

            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }

        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    2. `src/templatedString.ts`: The `getTemplatedString` function calls `getEnvVars` without any prior sanitization of the input `original`.
    ```typescript
    export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
        const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // Vulnerable line: Calls getEnvVars with potentially unsafe template
        return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
    }
    ```
    3. `src/Config.ts`: The `Config.ImportFromSettings` function loads configuration values from VS Code settings, including workspace settings, which can be controlled by malicious actors contributing to a project. These settings, including `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, are used as templates.
    4. `src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts`: In `CppDocGen.ts`, template strings from the configuration (e.g., `this.cfg.Generic.authorTag`) are passed to functions like `getMultiTemplatedString`, which eventually leads to the execution of `getEnvVars`. This happens in functions like `generateAuthorTag` and `generateCustomTag`.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a new VS Code workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder at the workspace root.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "doxdocgen.generic.authorTag": "@author {author} ($(touch /tmp/pwned))"
    }
    ```
    4. Open a C++ file (e.g., `test.cpp`) in the workspace. If you don't have one, create a new file `test.cpp` with any C++ code, for example:
    ```cpp
    void foo() {
    }
    ```
    5. Place the cursor above the `foo()` function declaration.
    6. Type `/**` and press Enter to trigger the Doxygen comment generation.
    7. Execute the command `ls /tmp/pwned` in your terminal.
    8. If the command executes without errors, it means the file `/tmp/pwned` was created, confirming the command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is successful if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists. If the command `ls /tmp/pwned` shows "No such file or directory", then the vulnerability was not triggered in this test environment. Note that success of this test depends on the environment and command execution capabilities. A more robust test might involve observing network traffic or logging command execution, if possible in the VS Code extension context. However, for a simple proof of concept, file creation is sufficient.
