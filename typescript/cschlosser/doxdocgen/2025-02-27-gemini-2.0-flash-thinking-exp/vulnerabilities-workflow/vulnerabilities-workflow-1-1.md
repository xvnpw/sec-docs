- Vulnerability Name: Environment Variable Injection in Configuration
- Description: The extension uses environment variables within its configuration settings. If a user is able to modify the workspace configuration (e.g., through workspace settings), they can inject arbitrary environment variables into the extension's configuration. When these configuration values are used in template strings, the extension will expand these environment variables using the `getEnvVars` function in `src/util.ts`. This could lead to information disclosure if sensitive environment variables are accessed and included in generated documentation.
- Impact: High. An attacker who can modify workspace settings could potentially leak sensitive information by injecting environment variables that contain secrets into the generated documentation. For example, an attacker could inject `${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}` into a custom tag, and if the documentation is publicly shared, the secret key could be exposed.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension directly expands environment variables without any sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for configuration settings that are used in template strings, especially when handling user-provided configuration values that might contain environment variables.
    - Avoid direct expansion of environment variables in user-configurable settings. If environment variables are necessary, provide a controlled and documented way to use them, and sanitize the input to prevent injection attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the workspace settings of VSCode where the extension is activated. This is typically possible for users who can access and edit the `.vscode/settings.json` file in a workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/util.ts`: The `getEnvVars` function is used to expand environment variables in strings.
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }

            const m = match[1];

            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString();

            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }

        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    - `src/Config.ts`: Configuration settings are loaded from VSCode settings and used in various template strings. For example, `Generic.customTags` is loaded from settings:
    ```typescript
    values.Generic.customTags = Generic.getConfiguration().get<string[]>("customTags", values.Generic.customTags);
    ```
    - `src/templatedString.ts`: The `getMultiTemplatedString` function, which is used to process configuration templates, calls `getEnvVars`:
    ```typescript
    export function getMultiTemplatedString(
        original: string,
        templates: ITemplate[],
    ): string {
        // For each replace entry, attempt to replace it with the corresponding param in the template
        for (const template of templates) {
            original = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        }
        return getEnvVars(getIndentedTemplate(original));
    }
    ```
    - User-configurable settings like `doxdocgen.file.copyrightTag`, `doxdocgen.file.customTag`, `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` are processed using these template functions, making them vulnerable to environment variable injection.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Install the "Generate Doxygen Comments" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open any workspace in VSCode.
    3. Navigate to the workspace settings: `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` (or `Code` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` on macOS).
    4. Select the "Workspace" tab in the Settings editor.
    5. In the settings search bar, type `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`.
    6. Click "Edit in settings.json" to modify the workspace settings.
    7. Add the following line to your workspace `settings.json` file:
    ```json
    "doxdocgen.generic.customTags": ["@note Environment PATH: ${env:PATH}"]
    ```
    8. Create a new C++ file (e.g., `test.cpp`) or open an existing one.
    9. Place your cursor above a function or at the beginning of the file and type `/**`, then press `Enter` to trigger Doxygen comment generation.
    10. Observe the generated Doxygen comment. It should contain a line similar to:
    ```cpp
    /**
     * @note Environment PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
     */
    ```
    where `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` is replaced by the actual `PATH` environment variable from your system. This demonstrates that the extension is vulnerable to environment variable injection through configuration settings. If you set the custom tag to something like  `"@note AWS Secret Key: ${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"` and you have `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` defined in your environment, the value of your AWS secret key will be included in the generated comment.
