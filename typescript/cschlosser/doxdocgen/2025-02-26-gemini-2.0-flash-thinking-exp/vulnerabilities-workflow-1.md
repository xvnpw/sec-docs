### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. Environment Variable Injection in Doxygen Comment Templates

- **Description:**
    The Doxdocgen extension allows users to define templates for Doxygen comments, which can include environment variables using the syntax `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}`. The extension uses the `env-var` library to expand these variables. If a user configures the extension with a template that includes an environment variable, and if an attacker can control the environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment (or modify VSCode settings to include environment variables), the attacker can inject arbitrary text into the generated Doxygen comments.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. **Attacker gains control over environment variables or VSCode settings:** An attacker gains control over environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment. This could be achieved by:
        - Compromising the user's `.bashrc` or similar shell configuration files.
        - Setting environment variables within VSCode launch configurations or tasks.
        - Modifying the VSCode settings for the Doxdocgen extension directly, either through local access or potentially exploiting another vulnerability to modify settings.
    2. **Attacker sets a malicious payload in an environment variable:** The attacker sets a malicious environment variable, for example, `MALICIOUS_TEXT` to contain: `\";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**`. This attempts to inject a new Doxygen note and prematurely close the comment block. Alternatively, for potential XSS in documentation, the attacker could set `XSS_PAYLOAD` to `'<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`.
    3. **User configures Doxdocgen to use environment variables in templates:** A user has configured Doxdocgen to use an environment variable in one of the comment templates, for example, in `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`: `["@note ${env:MALICIOUS_TEXT}"]` or `["@note Malicious Payload: ${env:XSS_PAYLOAD}"]`. This configuration is typically done in VSCode settings.
    4. **User triggers Doxygen comment generation:** The user triggers Doxygen comment generation in VS Code, for instance, by typing `/**` before a function and pressing Enter, or by using other Doxdocgen features that generate comments based on templates.
    5. **Extension expands environment variable:** The extension expands the environment variable (e.g., `MALICIOUS_TEXT` or `XSS_PAYLOAD`) in the comment template using the `getEnvVars` function.
    6. **Malicious payload injected into Doxygen comment:** The generated Doxygen comment will now include the attacker-controlled text from the environment variable, directly embedded without sanitization.

- **Impact:**
    An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the generated Doxygen comments. While this does not directly lead to code execution within VS Code or the extension itself, it can be used for various malicious purposes depending on how the generated documentation is used:
    - **Information Spoofing:** Injecting misleading or false information into the documentation, which can lead to misunderstandings, errors, or security issues in projects relying on this documentation.
    - **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation (potential):** If the generated documentation is processed by a system vulnerable to XSS (e.g., a web-based documentation viewer that renders HTML from Doxygen output), the injected content, especially if it includes JavaScript, could potentially execute malicious scripts when a user views the documentation in a web browser. This can lead to account compromise, information theft, or further attacks against users viewing the documentation.
    - **Social Engineering:** Injecting messages to mislead users or developers who read the documentation, potentially tricking them into performing actions that compromise security.
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to leak sensitive information from the user's environment by crafting environment variables that, when expanded, reveal system details or user-specific data within the generated comments. This information could be inadvertently exposed through documentation.
    - **Supply Chain Risks:** If the generated documentation is incorporated into larger software projects or distributed, the injected malicious content could propagate vulnerabilities downstream, posing supply chain risks to users of the software that includes the compromised documentation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The extension directly expands environment variables as configured in the settings using the `getEnvVars` function in `src/util.ts` without any sanitization or validation of the values.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization/Validation:** The extension should sanitize or validate environment variable values before including them in the generated comments. This could involve:
        - Restricting allowed characters to a safe subset.
        - Encoding special characters that could break the Doxygen comment structure or cause unintended formatting or security issues (e.g., HTML encoding, Doxygen comment escaping).
        - Using a whitelist approach to only allow specific environment variables or values.
    - **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** If the generated comments are intended for specific documentation formats like HTML or LaTeX (through Doxygen processing), apply context-aware encoding to the expanded environment variable values to prevent injection attacks in those contexts. For example, HTML encode special characters if the output is intended to be rendered as HTML.
    - **Warning to Users:** The extension could display a warning to users when environment variables are used in templates, highlighting the potential security risks associated with using untrusted environment variables.
    - **Configuration Option to Disable Expansion:** Provide a configuration setting to disable environment variable expansion altogether for users who are concerned about this risk or do not need this feature.
    - **Security Policy for Environment Variable Usage Re-evaluation:** Re-evaluate the necessity of expanding environment variables in user-configurable settings. If not essential, consider removing this feature entirely to eliminate the risk. If the feature is deemed necessary, clearly document the risks and advise users against using environment variables from untrusted sources and provide best practices for secure usage.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the Doxdocgen extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    2. The user must have configured Doxdocgen to use environment variables in at least one of the comment templates (e.g., `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, etc.) through VSCode settings.
    3. An attacker must be able to control environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment, or be able to modify the user's VSCode settings to inject malicious environment variable usage.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/util.ts:getEnvVars(replace: string)`:** This function is responsible for expanding environment variables in a given string `replace`.
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }

            const m = match[1];

            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString(); // <-- Environment variable is fetched without sanitization

            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }

        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    - **Visualization:** The `getEnvVars` function takes a string, searches for patterns like `${env:VAR_NAME}`, extracts the `VAR_NAME`, retrieves the environment variable value using `env.get(m, m).asString()` (from the `env-var` library), and replaces the pattern with the retrieved value.  The crucial point is the **lack of sanitization** of `envVar` before it's inserted into the `replacement` string.

    2. **`src/templatedString.ts:getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate)` and `getMultiTemplatedString`:** These functions are used to process templates and call `getEnvVars` to expand environment variables within them.
    ```typescript
    export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
        const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // <-- getEnvVars is called here
        return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
    }
    ```
    - `getMultiTemplatedString` similarly utilizes `getEnvVars` indirectly when processing multiple templates.

    3. **`src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts:generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file)` and other `generate*Tag` methods:**  Methods like `generateCustomTag`, `generateAuthorTag`, etc., within language-specific DocGen files (e.g., `CppDocGen.ts`) are responsible for generating specific Doxygen tags. These methods use `getMultiTemplatedString` or `getTemplatedString` to process templates defined in configuration settings, which ultimately leads to the vulnerable call of `getEnvVars`.
    ```typescript
    protected generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file) {
        // ...
        targetTagArray.forEach((element) => {
            if (element !== "custom") { // Prevent recursive expansion
                // Allow any of date, year, author, email to be replaced
                lines.push(
                    ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // <-- getMultiTemplatedString is called here
                        element,
                        [ /* ... */ ],
                    ).split("\n"),
                );
            }
        });
    }

    protected generateAuthorTag(lines: string[]) {
        if (this.cfg.Generic.authorTag.trim().length !== 0) {
            const authorInfo = this.getAuthorInfo();
            lines.push(
                ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // <-- getMultiTemplatedString is called here
                    this.cfg.Generic.authorTag,
                    [
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.authorTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorName },
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.emailTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorEmail },
                    ],
                ).split("\n"),
            );
        }
    }
    ```

    4. **Configuration Settings:** User-configurable settings like `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, `doxdocgen.file.copyrightTag`, etc., are read from VS Code settings and used as templates. These settings are where users can introduce `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax, making them the entry point for the vulnerability when combined with attacker-controlled environment variables.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the Doxdocgen extension in VS Code.
        - Configure `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` in VS Code settings to include `["@note ${env:MALICIOUS_INJECT}"]` to test comment injection, or `["@note Malicious Payload: ${env:XSS_PAYLOAD}"]` to test for potential XSS.
    2. **Set Malicious Environment Variable:**
        - **For Comment Injection:** In your terminal or VS Code launch configuration, set the environment variable `MALICIOUS_INJECT` to: `\";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**`.
        - **For XSS Test:** Set the environment variable `XSS_PAYLOAD` to: `'<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`.
        - For example, in a terminal (Linux/macOS): `export MALICIOUS_INJECT='";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**'` or `export XSS_PAYLOAD='<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`
        - On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:MALICIOUS_INJECT=";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**"` or `$env:XSS_PAYLOAD = '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`
    3. **Create or open a C/C++ file in VS Code.**
    4. **Trigger Doxygen comment generation:** Place your cursor on a line before a function definition and type `/**`, then press Enter to trigger Doxygen comment generation.
    5. **Observe the generated Doxygen comment in VS Code editor.**
        - **For Comment Injection Test:** Verify that the generated comment contains the injected text from the `MALICIOUS_INJECT` environment variable. You should see the injected `@note` and the premature closing of the comment block `/**`.
        - **For XSS Test:** Verify that the generated comment contains the line `* @note Malicious Payload: <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
    6. **(For XSS Test) Generate Doxygen documentation (HTML output).** This step requires having Doxygen installed and configured to generate HTML documentation for your project. This is an external tool and step outside of the VSCode extension's functionality. Use Doxygen to process the file with the generated comment.
    7. **(For XSS Test) Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser.**
    8. **(For XSS Test) Check for JavaScript execution.** If the JavaScript alert box "XSS Vulnerability" appears, it confirms that the environment variable payload was successfully injected and interpreted as HTML/JavaScript in the documentation output, demonstrating the potential for XSS.
