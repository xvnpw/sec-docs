## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Environment Variable Injection

- **Vulnerability Name**: Environment Variable Injection

- **Description**:
    1. An attacker can modify VS Code settings for the "doxdocgen" extension.
    2. The attacker sets a configuration option that uses a templated string, such as `"doxdocgen.generic.authorTag"` or `"doxdocgen.generic.customTags"`.
    3. Within this templated string, the attacker includes an environment variable placeholder with the syntax `${env:VARIABLE}`.
    4. The attacker sets the environment variable `VARIABLE` to a malicious value. This value can contain shell commands (for command injection), HTML/JavaScript payloads (for XSS), or sensitive information (for information disclosure).
    5. When the "doxdocgen" extension is triggered to generate documentation, the extension processes the configuration string.
    6. The `getEnvVars` function in `src/util.ts` expands the environment variable placeholder by retrieving the environment variable's value.
    7. Due to the lack of sanitization, the malicious value within the environment variable is directly inserted into the generated documentation comment.
    8. If the environment variable contains shell commands (e.g., using `$(...)` or ``...`` on Linux/macOS or `%...%` on Windows), these commands can be executed by the system shell leading to command injection.
    9. If the environment variable contains HTML or JavaScript, and the generated documentation is processed into HTML (e.g., by Doxygen), the payload can be executed in the end-user's browser leading to XSS.
    10. If the environment variable contains sensitive information, this information will be included in the generated documentation, potentially leading to information disclosure.

- **Impact**:
    - **Critical Impact (Command Injection):** Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, and system compromise.
    - **High Impact (Stored Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):** An injected script running in the context of the documentation viewer may steal session data, credentials, or redirect users to malicious websites.
    - **High Impact (Information Disclosure):** Sensitive information stored in environment variables can be inadvertently included in the generated documentation, leading to unintended disclosure if the documentation is shared or publicly accessible.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical (due to potential for Command Injection)

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The code directly uses environment variable values without any sanitization or validation. Based on the provided files, no mitigations have been implemented.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and HTML–encode the value of any environment variable expanded into a comment to prevent XSS and comment manipulation. For command injection, strictly validate and sanitize environment variable values if they are absolutely necessary for templating, or ideally, avoid environment variable expansion for user-configurable strings.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid using environment variables for user-configurable settings, especially when these settings are used in templated strings.
    - **Configuration Warnings:**  If environment variables are used in configuration, provide warnings to the user about the potential security implications, especially the risk of command injection, XSS, and information disclosure.
    - **Validation of Environment Variable Content:** Validate the content of substituted environment variable values to ensure that they do not include dangerous sequences (such as closing comment markers, HTML tags, or shell command injection syntax). If environment variable expansion is necessary, restrict the allowed characters in environment variable names and values to prevent injection.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. The user must have the "doxdocgen" VS Code extension installed.
    2. The user must modify a "doxdocgen" configuration setting that uses templated strings to include an environment variable placeholder (e.g., `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`).
    3. The attacker must be able to control or influence the environment variables on the system where VS Code is running when documentation is generated. This could be by directly setting environment variables, or in scenarios like CI/CD pipelines or shared development environments.
    4. The user must trigger the documentation generation feature of the extension.
    5. For XSS to be exploitable, the generated documentation must be processed into HTML and viewed in a browser.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **File: /code/src/util.ts**
        ```typescript
        export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
            let replacement = replace;
            const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
            let match: RegExpExecArray;

            while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
                if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                    regex.lastIndex++;
                }

                const m = match[1];

                const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString(); // Vulnerable line: Retrieves environment variable without sanitization

                replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar); // Vulnerable line: Replaces placeholder with unsanitized environment variable
            }

            return replacement;
        }
        ```
        The `getEnvVars` function retrieves environment variables and substitutes placeholders without any sanitization. This function is the root cause of the environment variable injection vulnerability.

    2. **File: /code/src/templatedString.ts**
        ```typescript
        export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
            const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
            const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // Calls vulnerable function
            return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
        }

        export function getMultiTemplatedString(
            original: string,
            templates: ITemplate[],
        ): string {
            for (const template of templates) {
                original = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
            }
            return getEnvVars(getIndentedTemplate(original)); // Calls vulnerable function
        }
        ```
        `getTemplatedString` and `getMultiTemplatedString` utilize `getEnvVars`, propagating the vulnerability to any configuration settings that use these functions for templating.

    3. **File: /code/src/Config.ts & /code/src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts**: Configuration settings like `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag` and `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` are loaded and used in `CppDocGen.ts` (and likely other language-specific DocGen files) via `getTemplatedString` or `getMultiTemplatedString`, making them vulnerable to environment variable injection. Specifically, methods like `generateAuthorTag` and `generateCustomTag` in `CppDocGen.ts` demonstrate this usage.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    2. Install the "doxdocgen" extension.
    3. Open the User Settings (JSON).
    4. Add or modify the `"doxdocgen.generic.authorTag"` setting to include an environment variable placeholder: `"doxdocgen.generic.authorTag": "@author ${env:PWN}"`
    5. **For Command Injection (Linux/macOS):** Open a terminal and set the environment variable `PWN` to a command that creates a file in the `/tmp` directory: `export PWN='$(touch /tmp/pwned_doxdocgen)'`
    6. **For Command Injection (Windows):** Open a command prompt as administrator and set the environment variable `PWN` to a command that creates a file in the `%TEMP%` directory: `setx PWN '"%TEMP%\\pwned_doxdocgen.txt"'` (restart VS Code might be needed).
    7. **For XSS:** Set environment variable `PWN` to `"><script>alert('XSS');</script><"`
    8. **For Information Disclosure:** Set environment variable `PWN` to `Sensitive API Key: your_api_key_here`
    9. Open a C++ file, place cursor above a function, type `/**` and press Enter.
    10. **For Command Injection:** Verify if `/tmp/pwned_doxdocgen` (Linux/macOS) or `%TEMP%\\pwned_doxdocgen.txt` (Windows) is created.
    11. **For XSS:** Generate documentation, then process it with Doxygen to HTML and open in browser. Check for alert box. Alternatively, inspect the generated comment in VS Code for unescaped `<script>` tag.
    12. **For Information Disclosure:** Inspect the generated comment in VS Code for the sensitive information "Sensitive API Key: your_api_key_here".


### 2. Doxygen Comment Injection via Function Name (Stored Cross–Site Scripting)

- **Vulnerability Name**: Doxygen Comment Injection via Function Name

- **Description**:
    1. An attacker introduces or modifies a C++ function declaration.
    2. The attacker crafts the function name to contain malicious HTML or JavaScript code, for example: `void Foo"><script>alert('XSS');</script>() {}`.
    3. When the "doxdocgen" extension processes the file, it extracts the function name to generate a Doxygen comment.
    4. The extension substitutes the raw, unsanitized function name into the comment template, such as the default `"@brief {text}"` template.
    5. No sanitization or HTML encoding is applied to the function name before substitution.
    6. The generated comment in the code file now contains the malicious HTML/JavaScript code verbatim.
    7. Later, when the documentation is processed by Doxygen or a similar tool to generate HTML documentation, the injected script is executed in the end-user's browser when viewing the documentation.

- **Impact**:
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Execution of injected JavaScript in the browser context can lead to compromised user sessions, credential theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The extension uses plain string substitutions without any character escaping or output–encoding of data that originated from the function name.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Output Encoding:** Apply output encoding (for example, escaping `<`, `>`, `&`, and quotes) for the function name before inserting it into the comment template to prevent interpretation as HTML.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate and restrict the allowed characters in function names to prevent injection of markup.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. The attacker must be able to submit or inject a malicious function declaration that is later parsed by the extension. This could be through direct code contribution, pull requests, or in collaborative coding environments.
    2. The documentation output produced by Doxygen (or another HTML-based renderer) is made available so that the injected payload runs in a browser.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **File: /code/src/templatedString.ts**: Functions like `getTemplatedString` perform raw replacement of placeholders without HTML encoding.
    2. **File: /code/src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts**: The generated comment, containing the unsanitized function name via template functions, is written to the editor.  Specifically, when generating brief descriptions or other tags that use the function name, these template functions are invoked.
    3. No layer of HTML output–encoding is applied before the substituted function name is written to the editor.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. Create a test C++ file.
    2. Declare a function with a malicious name: `void Foo"><script>alert('XSS-FunctionName');</script>() {}`
    3. Open the file in VS Code.
    4. Trigger comment generation (e.g., type `/**` above the function and press Enter).
    5. Inspect the generated comment in the code. It should contain the unescaped malicious `<script>` tag within the comment.
    6. Optionally, run Doxygen on the code to generate HTML output.
    7. Open the generated HTML documentation in a browser. Verify that an alert box with 'XSS-FunctionName' is displayed, confirming script execution.


### 3. Git Configuration Injection Leading to Stored Cross–Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Vulnerability Name**: Git Configuration Injection (XSS)

- **Description**:
    1. The "doxdocgen" extension is configured to use Git user information for author attribution (settings `useGitUserName` and/or `useGitUserEmail` are enabled).
    2. An attacker provides or convinces a user to adopt a malicious Git configuration.
    3. The attacker sets the `user.name` (or `user.email`) in the Git configuration to a string containing malicious HTML or JavaScript, like: `MaliciousUser"><script>alert('XSS-GitConfig');</script>`.
    4. When the extension generates documentation and includes author information, it retrieves the unsanitized `user.name` (or `user.email`) from the Git configuration.
    5. This unsanitized value is directly inserted into the documentation comment, typically in the `@author` tag, via template substitution.
    6. No output encoding or sanitization is applied to the Git configuration values before insertion.
    7. When the generated documentation is processed into HTML by Doxygen, the embedded script is executed in the viewer’s browser.

- **Impact**:
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Execution of injected JavaScript can lead to compromised user sessions, credential theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The extension directly substitutes Git configuration values into templates without any sanitization or encoding.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Output Encoding:** Sanitize Git configuration values by HTML–escaping dangerous characters before using them in templated strings.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the content of Git configuration entries to ensure that they do not include dangerous markup. For example, restrict allowed characters to alphanumeric and limited punctuation.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. The extension settings `useGitUserName` and/or `useGitUserEmail` must be enabled.
    2. The attacker must be able to influence the Git configuration values used by the extension. This could be through malicious `.git/config` files or by tricking the user into modifying local or global Git settings.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **File: /code/src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts**: The `getAuthorInfo()` function retrieves `authorName` and `authorEmail` from Git configuration when enabled.
    2. These values are passed unsanitized to template functions (`templates.getTemplatedString`, `templates.getMultiTemplatedString`).
    3. These template functions insert the unsanitized Git configuration values directly into the output comment.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. Enable Git user information in the workspace configuration of the extension.
    2. Modify the local Git configuration (e.g., using `git config user.name "MaliciousUser'><script>alert('XSS-GitConfig');</script>"`).
    3. Trigger documentation generation in a C++ file.
    4. Inspect the generated comment, particularly the `@author` tag. Verify that the malicious payload is present unsanitized.
    5. Optionally, process the comment with Doxygen and load the resulting HTML in a browser. Confirm that an alert box with 'XSS-GitConfig' is displayed.


### 4. File Name Injection Leading to Stored Cross–Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Vulnerability Name**: File Name Injection (XSS)

- **Description**:
    1. When generating file-level documentation, the "doxdocgen" extension uses the active document’s file name to populate tags (e.g., `@file`).
    2. An attacker creates or renames a file to include malicious HTML or JavaScript in the file name, such as `BadFile"><script>alert('FileXSS');</script>.cpp`.
    3. In `generateFilenameFromTemplate` in `CppDocGen.ts`, the file name is extracted (by stripping directory paths).
    4. The extracted file name is then inserted directly into the output comment template using string substitution via `templates.generateFromTemplate`, without sanitization.
    5. The generated comment in the code file now contains the malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
    6. When Doxygen or a similar tool processes the documentation to generate HTML output, the injected script is executed in the browser.

- **Impact**:
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Execution of injected JavaScript can lead to user data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The file name is used directly in template string generation without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Output Encoding:** Sanitize (HTML–encode) the file name before inserting it into the file documentation template.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the file name against an allowlist of safe characters or patterns before its inclusion in the output.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. The attacker must be able to influence the file name. This could be by committing files with malicious names in a repository, or in shared file systems.
    2. The generated documentation is later rendered by a tool (like Doxygen) which produces HTML output.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **File: /code/src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts**: The `generateFilenameFromTemplate` function extracts the file name using `this.activeEditor.document.fileName.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "")`.
    2. The extracted file name is passed directly to `templates.generateFromTemplate` using `cfg.File.fileTemplate`.
    3. No sanitization or output–encoding is applied to the file name before template substitution.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. In a repository, create or rename a file with a malicious name: `BadFile"><script>alert('FileXSS');</script>.cpp`.
    2. Open the file in VS Code.
    3. Trigger generation of the file header comment (e.g., ensure no header comment, save the file).
    4. Inspect the generated comment header in the code. Verify the malicious payload is present in the file name part.
    5. Optionally, process the comment with Doxygen and verify in a browser that an alert box with 'FileXSS' is displayed.
