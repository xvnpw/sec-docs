### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability 1: Environment Variable Injection in Templated Strings

- Description:
    - The `getEnvVars` function in `/code/src/util.ts` expands environment variables within strings used in configuration settings like `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag` and `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`.
    - An attacker who can control environment variables that are referenced in these settings can inject arbitrary text into the generated documentation.
    - While direct command injection is unlikely within the VS Code extension context, this can lead to information disclosure if environment variables contain sensitive data that is then included in the generated documentation.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker identifies that the Doxdocgen extension is in use and that it utilizes environment variables in its configuration, specifically in `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag` or `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`.
        2. The attacker gains control over the environment variables of the system where VS Code and the Doxdocgen extension are running. This could be achieved in various scenarios, such as in a CI/CD pipeline, a shared development environment, or by compromising the user's local system.
        3. The attacker sets a malicious environment variable, for example, `INJECT='Sensitive Info: <sensitive_data>'`.
        4. The attacker configures the Doxdocgen extension settings to include this environment variable in a tag, for example, setting `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` to `["@note ${env:INJECT}"]`.
        5. A developer using the Doxdocgen extension then triggers documentation generation in a C++ or C file (e.g., by typing `/**` above a function and pressing Enter).
        6. The `getEnvVars` function expands `${env:INJECT}` to the value of the `INJECT` environment variable, including the sensitive data in the generated comment.
        7. The generated documentation now unintentionally includes the sensitive information from the environment variable.

- Impact:
    - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information stored in environment variables can be inadvertently included in the generated documentation. This documentation might be committed to version control, shared with others, or exposed through documentation hosting, leading to unintended disclosure of sensitive data.
    - In scenarios where the generated documentation is processed further by other tools that might interpret the injected content (though unlikely in this specific extension context), there could be potential for further exploitation, but information disclosure is the primary and most realistic impact.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code directly retrieves and expands environment variables without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The extension should sanitize or encode the values retrieved from environment variables before including them in the generated documentation to prevent injection of potentially harmful content or disclosure of sensitive information in an uncontrolled manner.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid using environment variables for user-configurable settings, especially when these settings are used in templated strings that are directly inserted into the code. If environment variables are necessary, clearly document the security risks and advise users against storing sensitive information in environment variables that are used by the extension.
    - **Configuration Warnings:**  If environment variables are used in configuration, provide warnings to the user about the potential security implications, especially the risk of information disclosure if sensitive data is present in environment variables.

- Preconditions:
    1. The Doxdocgen extension must be installed and active in VS Code.
    2. The user must have configured `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag` or `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` to include environment variables using the `${env:VAR_NAME}` syntax.
    3. An attacker must be able to control the environment variables on the system where VS Code is running when documentation is generated.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/util.ts`
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }
            const m = match[1];
            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString();
            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }
        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    - The `getEnvVars` function uses a regular expression to find environment variable placeholders in a string and replaces them with the actual environment variable values.
    - There is no sanitization or validation of the environment variable values before they are inserted into the string.
    - File: `/code/src/templatedString.ts`
    ```typescript
    export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
        const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // Calls getEnvVars to expand env vars
        return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
    }
    export function getMultiTemplatedString(
        original: string,
        templates: ITemplate[],
    ): string {
        for (const template of templates) {
            original = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        }
        return getEnvVars(getIndentedTemplate(original)); // Calls getEnvVars to expand env vars
    }
    ```
    - `getTemplatedString` and `getMultiTemplatedString` both use `getEnvVars` to process the templated strings, making them vulnerable to environment variable injection.
    - File: `/code/src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts`
    ```typescript
    protected generateAuthorTag(lines: string[]) {
        if (this.cfg.Generic.authorTag.trim().length !== 0) {
            const authorInfo = this.getAuthorInfo();
            lines.push(
                ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // Uses getMultiTemplatedString
                    this.cfg.Generic.authorTag,
                    [
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.authorTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorName },
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.emailTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorEmail },
                    ],
                ).split("\n"),
            );
        }
    }

    protected generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file) {
        const targetTagArray = target === CommentType.file ? this.cfg.File.customTag : this.cfg.Generic.customTags;
        targetTagArray.forEach((element) => {
            if (element !== "custom") {
                lines.push(
                    ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // Uses getMultiTemplatedString
                        element,
                        [ /* ... */ ],
                    ).split("\n"),
                );
            }
        });
    }
    ```
    - `generateAuthorTag` and `generateCustomTag` in `CppDocGen.ts` use `getMultiTemplatedString` to process `authorTag` and `customTags` settings, making them vulnerable to environment variable injection.
    - The `CppDocGen.ts` file confirms that the configuration settings `cfg.Generic.authorTag` and `cfg.Generic.customTags` are processed using `templates.getMultiTemplatedString`, which in turn uses the vulnerable `getEnvVars` function. This reinforces the vulnerability identified.

- Security test case:
    1. Open VS Code and install the "Doxdocgen" extension.
    2. Open a C++ or C file in VS Code.
    3. In VS Code settings, navigate to "Extensions" -> "Doxdocgen" -> "Generic".
    4. Modify the "Custom Tags" setting (`doxdocgen.generic.customTags`) and add a new tag: `@note ${env:TEST_INJECTION}`.
    5. In your terminal or command prompt, set an environment variable named `TEST_INJECTION` with a harmless value, e.g., `export TEST_INJECTION="This is a test note"`. (or `set TEST_INJECTION="This is a test note"` on Windows).
    6. In the open C/C++ file, type `/**` above a function declaration and press Enter to trigger Doxygen comment generation.
    7. Observe the generated comment block. It should include a line like `* @note This is a test note`, confirming that the environment variable was successfully expanded.
    8. Now, in your terminal/command prompt, set the `TEST_INJECTION` environment variable to a potentially sensitive value, e.g., `export TEST_INJECTION="API_KEY=sensitive_api_key"`.
    9. Regenerate the Doxygen comment for another function or the same function (you might need to delete the existing comment and trigger it again).
    10. Observe the new generated comment block. It should now include `* @note API_KEY=sensitive_api_key`, demonstrating that sensitive information from environment variables can be injected into the documentation.
    11. To further illustrate risk, though harder to directly demonstrate in this context without deeper code execution analysis, consider if an attacker could inject formatting commands or special characters that might be misinterpreted by documentation rendering tools, although the primary risk remains information disclosure within comments.
