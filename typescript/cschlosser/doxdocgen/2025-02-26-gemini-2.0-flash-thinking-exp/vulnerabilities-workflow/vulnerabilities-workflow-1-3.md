### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Environment Variable Injection in Templated Strings
- Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the VSCode settings for the Doxdocgen extension.
    2. The attacker targets configuration settings that are used in templated strings, such as "doxdocgen.generic.customTags" or "doxdocgen.generic.authorTag".
    3. Within the setting value, the attacker injects a malicious payload using the syntax `${env:MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR}`, where `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR` is an environment variable they control or want to exploit.
    4. When the Doxdocgen extension generates Doxygen comments, it uses the `getEnvVars` function to expand these environment variables in the configuration settings.
    5. If the attacker-controlled environment variable contains a malicious string, this string is directly embedded into the generated Doxygen comments without sanitization.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker might be able to leak sensitive information from the user's environment by crafting environment variables that, when expanded, reveal system details or user-specific data within the generated comments. This information could be inadvertently exposed through documentation.
    - Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation: If the generated Doxygen comments are processed to create HTML documentation, and the injected payload includes malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript), it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities when users view the generated documentation in a web browser.
    - Supply Chain Risks: If the generated documentation is incorporated into larger software projects or distributed, the injected malicious content could propagate vulnerabilities downstream, posing supply chain risks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The `getEnvVars` function in `src/util.ts` expands environment variables without any sanitization or validation of the values.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization for the values retrieved from environment variables before including them in generated comments. This could involve stripping potentially harmful characters or encoding special characters to prevent unintended interpretation.
    - Context-Aware Output Encoding: If the generated comments are intended for specific documentation formats like HTML or LaTeX, apply context-aware encoding to the expanded environment variable values to prevent injection attacks in those contexts. For example, HTML encode special characters if the output is HTML.
    - Security Policy for Environment Variable Usage: Re-evaluate the necessity of expanding environment variables in user-configurable settings. If not essential, consider removing this feature to eliminate the risk. If necessary, clearly document the risks and advise users against using environment variables from untrusted sources.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the VSCode settings for the Doxdocgen extension. This could occur if the attacker has local access to the user's machine and can edit the VSCode settings file, or if there's another vulnerability that allows for settings modification.
- Source code analysis:
    - `src/util.ts`: The `getEnvVars` function is responsible for expanding environment variables within strings. It uses a regular expression to identify placeholders in the format `${env:VAR_NAME}` and replaces them with the corresponding environment variable values obtained using the `env-var` library. Crucially, it lacks any sanitization of the retrieved environment variable values before inserting them into the string.
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }

            const m = match[1];

            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString();

            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }

        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    - `src/templatedString.ts`: The `getTemplatedString` and `getMultiTemplatedString` functions utilize `getEnvVars` to process environment variables within template strings.
    ```typescript
    export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
        const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // Calling getEnvVars to expand env vars
        return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
    }
    ```
    - `src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts`: The `generateAuthorTag` and `generateCustomTag` methods in `CppDocGen.ts` call `getMultiTemplatedString`, thus indirectly using `getEnvVars` to expand environment variables in tags derived from user configurations.
    ```typescript
    protected generateAuthorTag(lines: string[]) {
        if (this.cfg.Generic.authorTag.trim().length !== 0) {
            const authorInfo = this.getAuthorInfo();
            // Allow substitution of {author} and {email} only
            lines.push(
                ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // Calling getMultiTemplatedString which calls getEnvVars
                    this.cfg.Generic.authorTag,
                    [
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.authorTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorName },
                        { toReplace: this.cfg.emailTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorEmail },
                    ],
                ).split("\n"),
            );
        }
    }

    protected generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file) {
        // ...
        targetTagArray.forEach((element) => {
            if (element !== "custom") { // Prevent recursive expansion
                // Allow any of date, year, author, email to be replaced
                lines.push(
                    ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString( // Calling getMultiTemplatedString which calls getEnvVars
                        element,
                        [
                            { toReplace: this.cfg.authorTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorName },
                            { toReplace: this.cfg.emailTemplateReplace, with: authorInfo.authorEmail },
                            { toReplace: this.cfg.dateTemplateReplace, with: moment().format(dateFormat) },
                            { toReplace: this.cfg.yearTemplateReplace, with: moment().format("YYYY") },
                            { toReplace: "{file}", with: this.activeEditor.document.fileName.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "")},
                        ],
                    ).split("\n"),
                );
            }
        });
    }
    ```
- Security test case:
    1. Open VS Code and navigate to the settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
    2. Switch to the "JSON" settings editor by clicking the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top-right corner.
    3. In your `settings.json` file (either User or Workspace settings), add or modify the Doxdocgen custom tags to include an environment variable with a potential malicious payload. For instance, to test for XSS in HTML documentation, add the following configuration:
        ```json
        "doxdocgen.generic.customTags": [
            "@note Malicious Payload: ${env:XSS_PAYLOAD}"
        ]
        ```
    4. In your operating system's environment variables, set the environment variable `XSS_PAYLOAD` to a JavaScript alert payload. For example, in a terminal:
        - On Linux/macOS: `export XSS_PAYLOAD='<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`
        - On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:XSS_PAYLOAD = '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>'`
    5. Open a C or C++ file in VS Code.
    6. Place your cursor on a line where you want to generate a Doxygen comment (e.g., before a function declaration).
    7. Type `/**` and press Enter to trigger the Doxygen comment generation.
    8. Observe the generated comment block. It should contain the line `* @note Malicious Payload: <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`.
    9. Generate Doxygen documentation for your project (this step assumes you have Doxygen configured to generate HTML output. This step is outside of VSCode extension, and relies on external tool).
    10. Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser.
    11. Check if the JavaScript alert "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the environment variable payload was successfully injected and interpreted as HTML/JavaScript in the documentation output, thus demonstrating the Environment Variable Injection vulnerability.
