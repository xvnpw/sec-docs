- **Vulnerability Name**: Doxygen Comment Injection Leading to Stored Cross–Site Scripting (XSS)
  **Description**:
  The extension generates documentation comments by taking data from external or user–controlled sources (for example, function names, workspace configuration templates, etc.) and inserting these values into comment templates via simple placeholder substitutions. Because the replacement functions (such as those in templatedString.ts) do not perform output encoding or sanitization, a maliciously crafted function declaration (or configuration change) can inject HTML or JavaScript into the generated comment. Later, if the documentation is processed into HTML (e.g. by Doxygen), the payload is executed in the end–user’s browser.
  - *Step by step exploitation example*:
    1. An attacker introduces a C++ function whose name contains embedded HTML/JavaScript (for example,
       `void Foo"><script>alert('XSS');</script>() {}`)
    2. When the extension processes the file to generate a Doxygen comment, it substitutes the raw function name into the template (for example, using the default `"@brief {text}"` template).
    3. Since no sanitization or HTML encoding is applied to the function name before substitution, the malicious code appears verbatim in the output comment.
    4. Later, when Doxygen converts the comment into an HTML page, the injected script is executed.

  **Impact**:
  An injected script running in the context of the documentation viewer may steal session data, credentials, or redirect users to malicious websites.

  **Vulnerability Rank**: High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  The extension uses plain string substitutions (via functions such as getTemplatedString and getMultiTemplatedString) without any character escaping or output–encoding of data that originated from untrusted sources.

  **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Apply output encoding (for example, escaping `<`, `>`, `&`, and quotes) for every inserted data element that originates from external or user–controlled sources.
  - Validate and restrict the allowed characters in function names and workspace configuration values used for templating.

  **Preconditions**:
  - The attacker must be able to submit or inject a malicious function declaration (or modify configuration values) that is later parsed by the extension.
  - The documentation output produced by Doxygen (or another HTML-based renderer) is made available so that the injected payload runs in a browser.

  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In **templatedString.ts**, functions such as `getTemplatedString` simply perform a raw replacement of template placeholders (e.g. replacing `{text}` with external input) and then pass the result to `getIndentedTemplate`.
  - In **CppDocGen.ts**, the unsanitized return value of these templated functions is used to generate the full Doxygen comment.
  - No layer of HTML output–encoding is applied before the substituted values are written to the editor.

  **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a test C++ file that declares a function with a malicious name, for example:
     ```cpp
     void Foo"><script>alert('XSS');</script>() {}
     ```
  2. Open the file in VS Code so that the extension is activated, and trigger the comment generation (e.g. by typing the trigger sequence such as `/**` followed by Enter).
  3. Inspect the generated comment – it should contain the unescaped malicious `<script>` tag.
  4. Optionally, run Doxygen on the code to generate HTML output and confirm that the injected script executes in a browser.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Environment Variable Injection Leading to Comment Output Manipulation
  **Description**:
  The extension supports substituting environment variable values into its documentation templates using a placeholder syntax (e.g. `${env:VARIABLE}`). In the function `getEnvVars` (in util.ts), the placeholder is replaced by the environment value with no sanitization or output encoding. If an environment variable’s value contains dangerous sequences (such as comment–closing symbols or HTML/JavaScript payloads), those characters are embedded directly into the generated comment.
  - *Step by step exploitation example*:
    1. An attacker arranges for (or convinces a victim to set) an environment variable (for example, `MY_SECRET`) to a value such as:
       ```
       */<script>alert('env injection');</script>/**
       ```
    2. The workspace or user configuration contains a custom template that uses this variable (e.g. `"@note ${env:MY_SECRET}"`).
    3. When the extension expands the template through `getEnvVars`, it performs a direct string substitution without escaping the dangerous characters.
    4. Later, when Doxygen processes the generated comment, the malicious script executes in the viewer’s browser.

  **Impact**:
  As with the direct function name injection, unsanitized insertion of environment variable data into documentation comments can lead to execution of arbitrary JavaScript, jeopardizing the integrity of user sessions and exposing sensitive data.

  **Vulnerability Rank**: High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  The code uses the “env-var” package to perform the raw substitution but does not apply additional sanitization or output–encoding to the substituted value.

  **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize and HTML–encode the value of any environment variable expanded into a comment.
  - Validate the content of substituted environment variable values to ensure that they do not include dangerous sequences (such as closing comment markers or HTML tags).

  **Preconditions**:
  - The attacker must be able to control (or influence) the environment variables that the extension uses for template substitution (for example, by setting a malicious value in a multi–user or compromised environment or tricking a user into setting an unsafe value).
  - The configuration template must include an environment variable placeholder (such as `${env:MY_SECRET}`) so that the payload is expanded.

  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In **util.ts**, the `getEnvVars` function uses a regular expression to match and replace environment variable placeholders within the input string.
  - Since no output encoding is applied, an environment variable’s value that includes HTML or dangerous comment–terminating characters is inserted directly into the generated comment.

  **Security Test Case**:
  1. In the workspace configuration (or via another method available to the extension), set up a custom comment template that uses an environment variable placeholder (e.g.:
     ```json
     "doxdocgen.file.customTag": ["@note ${env:MY_SECRET}"]
     ```
  2. In the shell (or environment in which VS Code is running), set the environment variable `MY_SECRET` to a test payload such as:
     ```
     */<script>alert('env injection');</script>/**
     ```
  3. Trigger the comment generation (for example, by saving a file to cause the header comment to be generated).
  4. Inspect the generated comment to verify that the environment variable’s malicious value appears unescaped.
  5. Optionally, process the generated comment through Doxygen (or view in an HTML preview) and verify that the injected script is present and active.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Git Configuration Injection Leading to Stored Cross–Site Scripting (XSS)
  **Description**:
  The extension is configured to inject author information into generated documentation comments. In doing so, it may use Git configuration values (such as the Git user name and email) if the settings (`useGitUserName` and `useGitUserEmail`) are enabled. These values are retrieved by the GitConfig module and are then inserted directly into the comment (e.g. via the `@author` tag) without any sanitization or output encoding.
  - *Step by step exploitation example*:
    1. An attacker provides (or convinces a user to adopt) a malicious Git configuration in which the `user.name` is set to a string like:
       ```
       MaliciousUser"><script>alert('GitXSS');</script>
       ```
    2. With the extension configured to use Git credentials for author attribution, the unsanitized Git user name is injected into the documentation comment.
    3. When the generated documentation is processed into HTML (for example, by Doxygen), the embedded script is executed in the viewer’s browser.

  **Impact**:
  Execution of injected JavaScript in the browser context can lead to compromised user sessions, credential theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

  **Vulnerability Rank**: High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  The extension merely substitutes Git configuration values into predefined templates. No output encoding or sanitization is applied to these values before inclusion in the generated comment.

  **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize Git configuration values by HTML–escaping dangerous characters before using them in templated strings.
  - Validate the content of Git configuration entries (for example, ensuring that only alphanumeric and limited punctuation are allowed) to prevent injection of markup.

  **Preconditions**:
  - The extension is set to use Git user information (i.e. `useGitUserName` and/or `useGitUserEmail` are enabled).
  - The attacker must be able to influence the Git configuration values used by the extension (for example, by supplying a malicious `.git/config` file or tricking the user into modifying local Git settings).

  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In **CppDocGen.ts**, the `getAuthorInfo()` function assigns `authorName` and `authorEmail` based on Git configuration values when the corresponding settings are enabled.
  - These unsanitized values are then passed to the template functions (e.g. `templates.getTemplatedString` and `templates.getMultiTemplatedString`) and are inserted directly into the output comment.

  **Security Test Case**:
  1. Enable Git user information in the workspace configuration.
  2. Modify (or simulate) the local Git configuration so that `user.name` is set to a payload such as:
     ```
     MaliciousUser"><script>alert('GitXSS');</script>
     ```
  3. Trigger the documentation generation process (for example, by invoking comment generation in a C++ file).
  4. Verify that the generated comment includes the malicious payload in the author tag unsanitized.
  5. Optionally, process the comment with Doxygen and load the resulting HTML in a browser to confirm that the script executes.

- **Vulnerability Name**: File Name Injection Leading to Stored Cross–Site Scripting (XSS)
  **Description**:
  When generating file–level documentation, the extension uses the active document’s file name to populate certain tags (for example, via the `@file` tag). In the function `generateFilenameFromTemplate` (in **CppDocGen.ts**), the file name is extracted from the editor object (by stripping directory paths) and is then inserted directly into the output comment template using a simple string substitution, with no sanitization applied. If an attacker can supply a file name that includes HTML or JavaScript payloads, this unsanitized input will be embedded directly in the generated comment.
  - *Step by step exploitation example*:
    1. An attacker commits a file with a name crafted to include malicious code—for instance:
       ```
       MockDocument.h"><script>alert('FileXSS');</script>.h
       ```
    2. When the extension generates the file header comment, it extracts the malicious file name and substitutes it into the template defined in `cfg.File.fileTemplate`.
    3. Since no output encoding is applied, the resulting comment includes the malicious payload verbatim.
    4. Later, when Doxygen renders the documentation as HTML, the injected script executes in the browser.

  **Impact**:
  The execution of injected code in the documentation’s HTML view could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing user data, hijacking sessions, or redirecting users to malicious destinations.

  **Vulnerability Rank**: High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  The file name is retrieved and used directly in the templated string generation process via `templates.generateFromTemplate` without any sanitization or encoding of potentially dangerous characters.

  **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize (HTML–encode) the file name before inserting it into the file documentation template.
  - Validate the file name against an allowlist of safe characters or patterns before its inclusion in the output.

  **Preconditions**:
  - The attacker must be able to influence the file name, for example by contributing source files with attacker–controlled names in a public repository.
  - The generated documentation is later rendered by a tool (such as Doxygen) which produces HTML output.

  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In **CppDocGen.ts**, the `generateFilenameFromTemplate` function extracts the file name with:
    ```javascript
    this.activeEditor.document.fileName.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "")
    ```
    and then passes the result directly into the template function `templates.generateFromTemplate` using `cfg.File.fileTemplate`.
  - There is no further sanitization or output–encoding applied to the file name.

  **Security Test Case**:
  1. In a repository, create (or rename) a file with a name that embeds an XSS payload (for example,
     `BadFile"><script>alert('FileXSS');</script>.cpp`).
  2. Open the file in VS Code so that the extension picks it up for file comment generation.
  3. Trigger generation of the file header comment (for example, by ensuring the file has no prior header and then saving it).
  4. Inspect the generated comment header to verify that the malicious payload is present as part of the file name.
  5. Optionally, process the generated comment with Doxygen and verify in a browser that the injected script executes.
