### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Environment Variable Injection in Doxygen Comment Templates

- **Description:**
    The Doxdocgen extension allows users to define templates for Doxygen comments, which can include environment variables using the syntax `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}`. The extension uses the `env-var` library to expand these variables. If a user configures the extension with a template that includes an environment variable, and if an attacker can control the environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment, the attacker can inject arbitrary text into the generated Doxygen comments.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An attacker gains control over environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment. For example, by compromising the user's `.bashrc` or setting environment variables within VSCode launch configuration.
    2. The attacker sets a malicious environment variable, for example, `MALICIOUS_TEXT` to contain: `\";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**`. This attempts to inject a new Doxygen note and prematurely close the comment block.
    3. A user has configured Doxdocgen to use an environment variable in one of the comment templates, for example, in `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`: `["@note ${env:MALICIOUS_TEXT}"]`.
    4. The user triggers Doxygen comment generation in VS Code, for instance, by typing `/**` before a function and pressing Enter.
    5. The extension expands the environment variable `MALICIOUS_TEXT` in the comment template using `getEnvVars` function.
    6. The generated Doxygen comment will now include the attacker-controlled text from the environment variable.

- **Impact:**
    An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the generated Doxygen comments. While this does not directly lead to code execution, it can be used for:
    - **Information Spoofing:** Injecting misleading or false information into the documentation.
    - **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation (potential):** If the generated documentation is processed by a system vulnerable to XSS (e.g., a web-based documentation viewer), the injected content could potentially execute malicious scripts, although this is less likely in typical Doxygen usage but theoretically possible if custom Doxygen processing is in place.
    - **Social Engineering:** Injecting messages to mislead users or developers who read the documentation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The extension directly expands environment variables as configured in the settings.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization/Validation:** The extension should sanitize or validate environment variable values before including them in the generated comments. For example, it could restrict allowed characters or escape special characters that could break the Doxygen comment structure or cause unintended formatting.
    - **Warning to Users:**  The extension could display a warning to users when environment variables are used in templates, highlighting the potential security risks.
    - **Configuration Option to Disable Expansion:** Provide a configuration setting to disable environment variable expansion altogether for users who are concerned about this risk.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have Doxdocgen extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    2. The user must have configured Doxdocgen to use environment variables in at least one of the comment templates (e.g., `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, etc.).
    3. An attacker must be able to control environment variables on the user's system or VSCode environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/util.ts:getEnvVars(replace: string)`:** This function is responsible for expanding environment variables in a given string `replace`.
    ```typescript
    export function getEnvVars(replace: string): string {
        let replacement = replace;
        const regex = /\$\{env\:([\w|\d|_]+)\}/m;
        let match: RegExpExecArray;

        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-conditional-assignment
        while ((match = regex.exec(replacement)) !== null) {
            if (match.index === regex.lastIndex) {
                regex.lastIndex++;
            }

            const m = match[1];

            const envVar: string = env.get(m, m).asString(); // <-- Environment variable is fetched without sanitization

            replacement = replacement.replace("${env:" + m + "}", envVar);
        }

        return replacement;
    }
    ```
    The `env.get(m, m).asString()` fetches the environment variable value without any sanitization.
    2. **`src/templatedString.ts:getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate)`:** This function calls `getEnvVars`.
    ```typescript
    export function getTemplatedString(original: string, template: ITemplate): string {
        const replacedTemplate = original.replace(template.toReplace, template.with);
        const replacedWithEnv = getEnvVars(replacedTemplate); // <-- getEnvVars is called here
        return getIndentedTemplate(replacedWithEnv);
    }
    ```
    3. **`src/Lang/Cpp/CppDocGen.ts:generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file)` and other `generate*Tag` methods:** These methods use `getMultiTemplatedString` or `getTemplatedString` to process templates, which ultimately leads to the call of `getEnvVars`. For example in `generateCustomTag`:
    ```typescript
    protected generateCustomTag(lines: string[], target = CommentType.file) {
        // ...
        targetTagArray.forEach((element) => {
            if (element !== "custom") { // Prevent recursive expansion
                // Allow any of date, year, author, email to be replaced
                lines.push(
                    ...templates.getMultiTemplatedString(
                        element,
                        [ /* ... */ ],
                    ).split("\n"), // <-- getMultiTemplatedString is called here
                );
            }
        });
    }
    ```
    4. **Configuration Settings:** User-configurable settings like `doxdocgen.generic.customTags`, `doxdocgen.generic.authorTag`, `doxdocgen.file.copyrightTag`, etc., are read from VS Code settings and used as templates.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the Doxdocgen extension in VS Code.
        - Configure `doxdocgen.generic.customTags` in VS Code settings to include `["@note ${env:MALICIOUS_INJECT}"]`.
    2. **Set Malicious Environment Variable:**
        - In your terminal or VS Code launch configuration, set the environment variable `MALICIOUS_INJECT` to: `\";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**`.
        - For example, in a terminal (Linux/macOS): `export MALICIOUS_INJECT='";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**'`
        - On Windows: `set MALICIOUS_INJECT=";\n * @note Injected Text by Attacker \n * Vulnerability Triggered \n * malicious code here \n/**"`
    3. **Create a C++ file and type `/**` before a function definition, then press Enter to trigger Doxygen comment generation.**
        ```cpp
        /**
         *
         */
        void testFunction() {
        }
        ```
    4. **Observe the generated Doxygen comment.** It will contain the injected text from the `MALICIOUS_INJECT` environment variable, demonstrating the environment variable injection vulnerability. You should see something like:
        ```cpp
        /**
         *  *
         * @note ";
         *  * Injected Text by Attacker
         *  * Vulnerability Triggered
         *  * malicious code here
         *  */
         * /
         * @brief
         *
         */
        void testFunction() {
        }
        ```
        Note that the injected text is included within the comment block, and the comment is prematurely closed due to the injected `/**`.
