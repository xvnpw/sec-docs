# Threat Model Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack on ES Modules](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_on_es_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as an internal, unpublished module used by the application.  The attacker crafts the malicious package to have a higher version number than the internal module.  During development or build, the package manager (used by `@web/dev-server` or other tooling) might resolve to the malicious package instead of the intended internal module.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, complete system compromise, or installation of backdoors. This is a *direct* threat because `@modernweb-dev/web` relies heavily on ES Modules and their resolution.
*   **Affected Component:** ES Module resolution, `import` statements, `package.json` dependencies, `@web/dev-server` (if it handles module resolution).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Scoped Packages:** Use scoped packages (e.g., `@my-org/my-module`) for all internal modules.
    *   **Private Registry:** Host internal modules on a private package registry.
    *   **Dependency Locking:**  Use strict dependency locking and *regularly* review/update lockfiles.
    *   **Integrity Checks:**  Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for externally loaded modules.
    *   **Explicit Imports:** Avoid dynamic imports with untrusted paths.

## Threat: [Service Worker Cache Poisoning](./threats/service_worker_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (even a temporary XSS) or misconfiguration to inject malicious content into the service worker's cache.  This content is then served to users, even offline.  This is *direct* because `@modernweb-dev/web` facilitates service worker usage.
*   **Impact:** Persistent XSS, data exfiltration, denial of service, or complete application takeover. The attack persists even after the original vulnerability is patched.
*   **Affected Component:** `@web/dev-server` (if used with service workers), Service Worker API, application's service worker implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Serve the application and service worker script exclusively over HTTPS.
    *   **Strict Scope:** Define a narrow `scope` for the service worker.
    *   **Cache Hygiene:** Implement careful cache management (versioning, clearing old caches).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a strong CSP, especially the `worker-src` directive.
    *   **Update Mechanism:** Implement a robust update/unregister mechanism for compromised service workers. Use `clients.claim()`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize any user input processed by the service worker.
    *   **Network-First Strategy:** Prefer network-first caching for critical resources.

## Threat: [Development Server Exposure](./threats/development_server_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses the `@web/dev-server` running on a developer's machine or a publicly accessible staging environment. The attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the dev server to access source code, configuration, or other sensitive data. This is *direct* because it involves the `@web/dev-server` component.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of source code, API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information. Potential for code modification or injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Affected Component:** `@web/dev-server`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Restrictions:** Configure the dev server to listen only on `localhost` or a trusted network interface.
    *   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS even during development.
    *   **Authentication:**  Implement authentication if remote access is needed.
    *   **Configuration Review:**  Regularly review and update the dev server's configuration.
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Disable directory listing.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Use environment variables for sensitive configuration, *not* in source code.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the development server with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Web Component](./threats/malicious_third-party_web_component.md)

* **Description:** The application uses a third-party Web Component that contains malicious code. This is *direct* because `@modernweb-dev/web` promotes the use of Web Components. The malicious code could perform XSS or other harmful actions.
* **Impact:** XSS, data theft, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
* **Affected Component:** Third-party Web Components integrated into the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vetting:** Thoroughly vet third-party components before use.
    *   **Reputable Sources:** Obtain components from trusted sources.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep third-party components updated.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing components using iframes.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict component actions.
    * **Code Review:** If possible, review the component's source code.

## Threat: [Over-reliance on Client-Side Validation (Bypassing Server-Side Checks)](./threats/over-reliance_on_client-side_validation__bypassing_server-side_checks_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer, encouraged by the ease of client-side development with `@modernweb-dev/web`, implements input validation and authorization checks *only* on the client-side. An attacker bypasses these checks. This is *indirectly* related, as the framework's focus might lead to this, but it's a *critical* general practice to avoid.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or other server-side attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** All application components handling user input or authorization, especially those interacting with server-side APIs.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** *Always* perform thorough validation and authorization on the server-side.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security (client-side *and* server-side).
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input on the server.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode all output from the server.
    *   **Secure API Design:** Design APIs with security in mind (authentication, authorization).
