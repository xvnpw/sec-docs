# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Control of Exposed Web Component Parts](./mitigation_strategies/strict_control_of_exposed_web_component_parts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Essential Styling Hooks:** Carefully analyze your web component's design and determine which parts *absolutely must* be stylable from outside the Shadow DOM.  Avoid exposing internal elements unnecessarily.
2.  **Minimize `::part` and `::theme` Usage:** Use `::part` to expose only specific, named parts of your component's internal structure.  Use `::theme` sparingly, primarily for high-level theming variables.
3.  **Document Exposed Parts:** Create clear documentation for each web component, listing all exposed parts (using `::part`) and theme variables (using `::theme`).  Explain the intended purpose and usage of each.
4.  **Code Review:** During code reviews, specifically check for any new uses of `::part` or `::theme` and ensure they adhere to the established guidelines.
5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically (e.g., every few months or after major refactoring) review all web components to ensure that exposed parts are still necessary and documented.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shadow DOM Piercing (High Severity):** Malicious actors could inject custom styles through exposed `::part` or `::theme` selectors, potentially altering the component's appearance, layout, or even behavior (e.g., by hiding elements, overlapping content, or triggering unintended actions).
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Exposing internal implementation details through `::part` could reveal information about the component's structure, which could be used to craft more targeted attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shadow DOM Piercing:** Significantly reduces the risk. By limiting exposed parts, the attack surface is drastically reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk by minimizing the amount of internal information exposed.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `src/components/MyComponent.js` (documentation and minimal `::part` usage).
    *   Fully implemented in `src/components/AnotherComponent.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing comprehensive documentation for all components in `src/components/`.
    *   Missing regular audit process.
    *   `src/components/LegacyComponent.js` needs review for excessive `::part` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Web Component Template Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/web_component_template_sanitization.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Dynamic Content:** Identify all instances within your web components where user-provided data or data from external sources is inserted into the DOM (e.g., within template literals).
2.  **Choose a Sanitization Library:** Select a robust and well-maintained HTML sanitization library, such as DOMPurify.  Install it as a project dependency.
3.  **Implement Sanitization:** Before inserting any dynamic content into the DOM, pass it through the sanitization library's cleaning function (e.g., `DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)`).  This removes any potentially malicious HTML tags, attributes, or JavaScript code.
4.  **Configure Sanitizer (if needed):**  Configure the sanitization library to allow specific, safe HTML elements and attributes that your component requires.  Be as restrictive as possible.
5.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the sanitization with various inputs, including known XSS payloads, to ensure it effectively removes malicious content.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Web Components (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into the component's Shadow DOM, which could be used to steal user data, hijack sessions, or deface the application.
    *   **DOM Clobbering (Medium Severity):** Sanitization can help prevent DOM clobbering attacks, where attackers manipulate the DOM structure to overwrite or interfere with existing elements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Very high impact.  Proper sanitization is the primary defense against XSS.
    *   **DOM Clobbering:** Moderate impact. Sanitization helps, but other defenses (like avoiding global variable names) are also important.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in `src/components/CommentComponent.js` using DOMPurify.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in `src/components/UserProfileComponent.js` where user-provided bio is displayed.
    *   Missing in `src/components/NewsFeedItem.js` where external content is loaded.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Development Server Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_development_server_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Localhost Binding:** Configure the `modernweb-dev/web` development server to bind *only* to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) or a specific local IP address.  This prevents external access to the server. Use the appropriate command-line flags or configuration options (e.g., `--host 127.0.0.1`, `--open none`).
2.  **Disable Public Access:** Ensure that the development server is *not* accessible from the public internet or other networks.  Double-check firewall settings and network configurations.
3.  **HTTPS in Development (Optional but Recommended):** Use a tool like `mkcert` to generate self-signed certificates for local development.  Configure the development server to use HTTPS. This helps prevent mixed-content warnings and simulates the production environment more closely.
4.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If the development server provides features you don't need (e.g., live reloading on a specific component), disable them to reduce the potential attack surface. Review the server's documentation for available options.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Development Server (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing the development server and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the server itself or the application code.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information (e.g., source code, API keys) that might be accessible through the development server.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Low Severity - if using HTTPS):** Using HTTPS in development helps prevent MitM attacks, although the risk is lower on a local network.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Very high impact.  Restricting access to `localhost` is essential.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderate impact.  Depends on what information is accessible through the server.
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Low impact (with HTTPS).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Development server configured to bind to `localhost` using `--host 127.0.0.1`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   HTTPS not currently used in development.
    *   Need to review and potentially disable unnecessary server features.
