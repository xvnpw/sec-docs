*   **2.1. Dependency Confusion/Substitution:**
    *   **2.1.1. Publish Malicious Package with Similar Name to Internal Dependency CRITICAL:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package to a public registry (e.g., npm) with a name similar to an internal, private package used by the application.  If the build system is misconfigured, it might install the malicious package instead of the intended internal one.

        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

            *   Use a private package registry for internal packages.
            *   Configure the package manager (npm, yarn) to prioritize the private registry.
            *   Use scoped packages (@scope/package-name) to further reduce the risk of name collisions.

*   **2.2. Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies CRITICAL:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker compromises a legitimate dependency (either direct or transitive) of the application, injecting malicious code that will be executed when the application is built or run.

    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly update all dependencies.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
