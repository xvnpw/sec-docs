## Deep Analysis of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Attack Surface

This analysis delves into the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attack surface within the context of an application utilizing the `modernweb-dev/web` library. While `web` itself doesn't inherently introduce SSTI vulnerabilities, its role in handling HTTP requests and responses makes it a crucial component to consider when evaluating this attack surface.

**Understanding the Interplay: `modernweb-dev/web` and Templating Engines**

The `modernweb-dev/web` library is a lightweight and flexible HTTP request multiplexer and middleware handler for Go. It provides the foundation for building web applications by routing requests to specific handlers. However, it doesn't dictate *how* those handlers generate responses. This is where templating engines come into play.

Developers often use templating engines (like Go's built-in `html/template`, `text/template`, or external libraries like `Pongo2`, `Ace`, etc.) to dynamically generate HTML or other textual content for responses. SSTI vulnerabilities arise when user-controlled data is directly embedded into these templates without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that is then executed on the server.

**Deep Dive into the Attack Surface:**

1. **Entry Points for User-Controlled Data:**

   * **Request Parameters (GET/POST):**  Data submitted through URL parameters or form submissions is a primary source of user input. If this data is directly used within template rendering without sanitization, it becomes a potential SSTI vector.
   * **Request Headers:** While less common, certain request headers could be incorporated into templates for logging or personalization. If not handled carefully, this could be exploited.
   * **Cookies:** Similar to headers, cookie values could be used in templates.
   * **Database Content:**  If data fetched from a database (which might have originated from user input) is directly rendered in a template without proper escaping, it can be a source of SSTI, especially if the database itself is vulnerable to injection attacks.
   * **External APIs/Services:** Data retrieved from external sources, if incorporated into templates without sanitization, can introduce vulnerabilities if those external sources are compromised or return malicious data.

2. **How `web` Facilitates the Attack:**

   * **Handler Functions:** `web` routes incoming requests to specific handler functions. These functions are responsible for processing the request, potentially retrieving data, and then rendering the response, often using a templating engine. If a handler directly embeds unsanitized user input into a template, `web` facilitates the execution of the vulnerable code.
   * **Middleware:** Middleware functions in `web` can also play a role. If middleware modifies request or response data in a way that introduces unsanitized user input into the templating process, it can contribute to the attack surface.
   * **Context (`web.C`):** The `web.C` context provides access to request information. If developers directly access and use user-provided data from the context within template rendering without sanitization, it creates an SSTI vulnerability.

3. **Templating Engine Specifics:**

   * **Syntax and Features:** Different templating engines have different syntax and features. Understanding the specific engine being used is crucial for identifying potential injection points. Features like function calls, variable access, and control flow within templates are prime targets for exploitation.
   * **Auto-escaping:** Some templating engines offer automatic escaping of output by default, which can significantly reduce the risk of SSTI. However, developers might disable this feature or use "raw" output functionalities, reintroducing the vulnerability.
   * **Security Considerations:**  Each templating engine has its own security considerations and best practices. Developers need to be aware of these and follow them diligently.

4. **Attack Vectors and Payloads:**

   Attackers will attempt to inject code snippets that can be interpreted and executed by the templating engine on the server. The specific payloads will depend on the templating engine being used. Common techniques include:

   * **Accessing Object Properties and Methods:**  Injecting code to access and invoke methods of objects available within the template context, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
   * **Executing System Commands:**  Attempting to execute operating system commands through template expressions.
   * **Reading Sensitive Files:**  Injecting code to read files from the server's file system.
   * **Modifying Application State:**  Injecting code to manipulate application data or settings.

**Detailed Example Scenarios:**

Let's consider an application using `modernweb-dev/web` and Go's `html/template` package:

**Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"html/template"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/modernweb-dev/web"
)

func main() {
	app := web.New()

	app.Get("/hello/:name", func(c web.C, w http.ResponseWriter) {
		name := c.URLParams["name"]
		tmpl, err := template.New("hello").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{.}}</h1>")
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		tmpl.Execute(w, name) // Directly embedding user input
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", app)
}
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could send a request like: `/hello/{{ .Getenv "HOSTNAME" }}`

In this case, the `{{ .Getenv "HOSTNAME" }}` payload will be interpreted by the `html/template` engine, and the server's hostname will be executed and displayed in the HTML output. This demonstrates a simple form of SSTI. More complex payloads could lead to remote code execution.

**Impact Assessment (Beyond the Initial Description):**

* **Data Breaches:** Attackers could access sensitive data stored on the server, including configuration files, database credentials, and user data.
* **Server Takeover:** Remote code execution allows attackers to gain complete control of the server, potentially installing malware, creating backdoors, and pivoting to other internal systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive commands, causing the server to become unresponsive.
* **Lateral Movement:**  A compromised server can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful SSTI attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Data breaches, service disruptions, and recovery efforts can lead to significant financial losses.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the nature of the data accessed, SSTI attacks can lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

**Enhanced Mitigation Strategies:**

**Developers:**

* **Treat User Input as Untrusted:**  Adopt a security mindset where all user-provided data is considered potentially malicious.
* **Contextual Output Escaping:**  Escape output based on the context in which it's being used (HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL encoding, etc.). Leverage the auto-escaping features of the chosen templating engine where available, but understand its limitations.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected client-side scripts (which can be a consequence of SSTI).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the web application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage an attacker can cause if they gain code execution.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep templating engine libraries and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SSTI, validating and sanitizing user input can help prevent other types of attacks and reduce the overall attack surface.
* **Consider Logic-less Templating Languages (with caution):** While logic-less templates reduce the risk of direct code execution within the template, developers still need to be careful about how data is prepared and passed to the template.
* **Secure Configuration of Templating Engines:** Review the configuration options of the chosen templating engine and ensure they are set to the most secure defaults.

**Development Team Practices:**

* **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews with a focus on identifying potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can automatically identify potential SSTI flaws in the codebase.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Employ DAST tools to test the running application for SSTI vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads.
* **Security Training:**  Provide regular security training to developers to raise awareness about SSTI and other common web application vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.

**Detection and Prevention in the Context of `modernweb-dev/web`:**

* **Middleware for Sanitization:**  Consider implementing middleware functions in `web` that automatically sanitize or escape user input before it reaches the templating engine. However, be cautious about over-generalizing sanitization, as it might break legitimate use cases. Contextual escaping within the template rendering logic is generally preferred.
* **Centralized Templating Logic:**  If possible, centralize the template rendering logic to make it easier to review and secure.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging to detect suspicious activity, such as attempts to inject malicious code into templates.

**Conclusion:**

While `modernweb-dev/web` provides the framework for building web applications, the risk of Server-Side Template Injection primarily stems from how developers integrate and utilize templating engines in conjunction with user-provided data. A thorough understanding of the chosen templating engine's features and security implications, coupled with diligent implementation of mitigation strategies, is crucial to prevent this critical vulnerability. The development team must adopt a security-conscious approach throughout the development lifecycle, from design to deployment, to effectively minimize the SSTI attack surface. Regular security assessments and penetration testing are essential to identify and address any potential weaknesses.
