## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using modernweb-dev/web [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_modernweb-devweb__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and serves as the root of all potential attack paths. Successful compromise means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access and control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This path involves targeting weaknesses in how the `modernweb-dev/web` library handles routing of incoming requests. Successful exploitation can lead to bypassing security checks, accessing unintended functionalities, or even executing arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Route Hijacking/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__route_hijackingspoofing.md)

Attackers attempt to manipulate the application's routing logic to redirect requests to malicious handlers or to execute unintended code. This can involve injecting new route definitions or exploiting weaknesses in how routes are matched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Route Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_route_definitions__critical_node_.md)

If the `modernweb-dev/web` library allows for dynamic route registration based on configuration or user-controlled input, attackers can inject malicious route definitions. This allows them to intercept traffic intended for legitimate endpoints and redirect it to attacker-controlled handlers, potentially executing arbitrary code or serving malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Unauthorized Access to Protected Routes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__unauthorized_access_to_protected_routes__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms to access routes that should be restricted to specific users or roles.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Authentication/Authorization Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_authenticationauthorization_middleware__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to circumvent the middleware responsible for verifying user identity and permissions. This can be achieved by exploiting flaws in the middleware's implementation, its execution order, or by manipulating request parameters to bypass checks. Successful bypass grants access to protected resources and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This path targets weaknesses within the middleware components of the `modernweb-dev/web` library or custom middleware built on top of it. Exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including bypassing security checks, manipulating data, or even achieving arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Middleware Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__malicious_middleware_injection__critical_node_.md)

Attackers attempt to inject their own malicious middleware into the application's processing pipeline. This injected middleware can intercept requests, modify responses, or execute arbitrary code before the intended application logic is reached, granting significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (if web provides one) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_templating_engine_vulnerabilities__if_web_provides_one___critical_node_.md)

If the `modernweb-dev/web` library integrates a templating engine, this path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within that engine, particularly Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

When user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization or escaping, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server by the templating engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical outcome of successful SSTI. By injecting malicious code into templates, attackers can gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to full server compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This path involves targeting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that the `modernweb-dev/web` project depends on. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application if the dependencies are not properly managed and updated.
