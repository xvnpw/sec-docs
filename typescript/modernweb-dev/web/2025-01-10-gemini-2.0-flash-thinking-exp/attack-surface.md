# Attack Surface Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in custom middleware functions added to the request processing pipeline.
    *   **How `web` Contributes:** `modernweb-dev/web` provides a mechanism to define and chain middleware functions. Any vulnerabilities introduced within these custom middleware functions become part of the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware might have a flaw allowing bypass under certain conditions.
    *   **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, authorization failures, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the middleware's purpose)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware functions for security vulnerabilities.
            *   Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware.
            *   Consider using well-vetted and established middleware libraries where possible.
            *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding within middleware.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of User Input in Handlers](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_user_input_in_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**  Handler functions directly using data received from requests (query parameters, request body) without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   **How `web` Contributes:** While `modernweb-dev/web` facilitates receiving request data, it's the responsibility of the handler functions to process this data securely. The lack of built-in input sanitization within the core library means developers must implement this themselves.
    *   **Example:** A handler processing a search query from a URL parameter might directly use this parameter in a database query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, etc.), cross-site scripting (XSS) if output is not properly encoded.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation for all data received from requests.
            *   Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
            *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Encode output appropriately based on the context (HTML encoding, URL encoding, etc.) to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**  Allowing user-controlled data to be directly embedded in templates without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **How `web` Contributes:** If the application uses a templating engine in conjunction with `modernweb-dev/web` and doesn't properly handle user input within templates, it can be vulnerable to SSTI. The `web` library itself doesn't introduce SSTI, but its usage in conjunction with templating engines requires careful attention.
    *   **Example:** A user-provided name might be directly inserted into a template like `<h1>Hello, {{.Name}}</h1>`. If `.Name` is not properly escaped and the templating engine allows code execution, an attacker could inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid allowing user input directly into template expressions.
            *   Use templating engines that provide automatic escaping of output by default.
            *   If dynamic template generation is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate user input before embedding it in templates.
            *   Consider using logic-less templating languages to reduce the risk.
