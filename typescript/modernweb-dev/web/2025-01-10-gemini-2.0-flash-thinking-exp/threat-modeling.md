# Threat Model Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploitation in Request Handling](./threats/malicious_input_exploitation_in_request_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within HTTP requests that specifically targets vulnerabilities in how the `modernweb-dev/web` library parses and handles this data. This could exploit weaknesses in the library's request handling logic to cause errors, bypass security checks implemented by the library, or lead to unexpected behavior within the framework itself.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) of applications built with `modernweb-dev/web` due to the library crashing or becoming unresponsive.
*   Circumvention of security measures implemented within the `modernweb-dev/web` framework.
*   Potential for triggering vulnerabilities in other parts of the application due to the library's flawed input processing.

**Affected Component:** Request Handling Module (core component responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests within the `modernweb-dev/web` library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize the input validation and sanitization mechanisms provided by the `modernweb-dev/web` library, if available, and ensure they are correctly implemented.
*   Review the `modernweb-dev/web` library's documentation and code to understand its input handling behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement additional input validation layers within the application logic to supplement the library's capabilities.

## Threat: [Route Hijacking/Bypass](./threats/route_hijackingbypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL or request path to exploit vulnerabilities in the `modernweb-dev/web` library's routing mechanism. This could allow them to access routes or functionalities that are not intended to be accessible or to bypass authorization checks implemented by the framework's routing logic.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the application managed by the `modernweb-dev/web` routing.
*   Circumvention of authentication and authorization mechanisms enforced by the framework.
*   Potential for executing unintended actions or accessing restricted resources due to flawed route matching within the library.

**Affected Component:** Routing Module (the component within `modernweb-dev/web` responsible for mapping incoming requests to specific handlers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define clear and unambiguous route patterns when using the `modernweb-dev/web` library's routing features.
*   Avoid using overly broad or wildcard route definitions that could lead to unintended matches.
*   Thoroughly test the application's routing configuration to ensure that access controls are enforced as expected by the `modernweb-dev/web` framework.

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Injection/Exploitation](./threats/malicious_middleware_injectionexploitation.md)

**Description:** If the `modernweb-dev/web` library supports middleware or interceptors, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how the library manages or executes this middleware. This could allow them to inject malicious code into the request processing pipeline managed by the `modernweb-dev/web` framework, potentially intercepting or modifying requests and responses.

**Impact:**
*   Complete compromise of the application as the attacker's injected code executes within the context of the `modernweb-dev/web` application.
*   Data interception, modification, or theft occurring within the request/response cycle managed by the framework.
*   Privilege escalation if the injected middleware can bypass authorization checks enforced by the `modernweb-dev/web` framework.

**Affected Component:** Middleware Handling Mechanism (the component within `modernweb-dev/web` responsible for managing and executing middleware functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that the `modernweb-dev/web` library's middleware registration and loading mechanisms are secure and prevent unauthorized injection.
*   If the library allows for dynamic middleware registration, strictly validate the source and integrity of any dynamically added middleware.
*   Implement strong access controls for modifying the middleware configuration within the `modernweb-dev/web` framework.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults and Configuration](./threats/insecure_defaults_and_configuration.md)

**Description:** The `modernweb-dev/web` library might have default configurations that are insecure or require explicit hardening. If developers rely on these defaults without proper configuration, it could introduce vulnerabilities directly stemming from the library's setup.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of sensitive data or functionalities due to insecure default settings within the `modernweb-dev/web` framework.
*   Increased attack surface if security features provided by the library are disabled or weakly configured by default.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management (how the `modernweb-dev/web` library's settings and options are managed and initialized).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review the `modernweb-dev/web` library's documentation regarding security-related configuration options.
*   Ensure that all necessary security features provided by the library are explicitly enabled and configured securely.
*   Avoid relying on default configurations without understanding their security implications.
*   Implement a secure configuration management process for applications built with `modernweb-dev/web`.
