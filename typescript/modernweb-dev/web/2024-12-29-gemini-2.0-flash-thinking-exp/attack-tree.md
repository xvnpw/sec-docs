## High-Risk Attack Sub-Tree for Application Using modernweb-dev/web

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data or functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced or facilitated by the `modernweb-dev/web` project.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using modernweb-dev/web **CRITICAL NODE**
    * OR
        * **HIGH-RISK PATH** Exploit Misconfigured Security Headers (Introduced/Recommended by web) **CRITICAL NODE**
            * AND
                * Identify Missing Security Header (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
                * Exploit Missing Header Vulnerability (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle downgrade attack, Clickjacking, MIME confusion)
            * AND
                * Identify Weak Security Header Configuration (e.g., overly permissive CSP, insecure Referrer-Policy)
                * Exploit Weak Configuration (e.g., bypass CSP to inject malicious scripts, leak sensitive information via Referrer)
        * **HIGH-RISK PATH** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Recommended Dependencies (Indirectly introduced by web's recommendations) **CRITICAL NODE**
            * AND
                * Identify Vulnerable Dependency Recommended by web (e.g., outdated library with known security flaws)
                * Exploit Dependency Vulnerability (e.g., Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS))

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Compromise Application Using modernweb-dev/web**

* This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other significant harm.

**High-Risk Path and Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigured Security Headers (Introduced/Recommended by web)**

* **High-Risk Path:** This path is considered high-risk because:
    * **Likelihood:** Misconfiguring security headers is a common developer oversight, making this attack path relatively likely.
    * **Impact:** Successfully exploiting missing or weak security headers can lead to significant vulnerabilities like Man-in-the-Middle attacks, Clickjacking, Cross-Site Scripting (via CSP bypass), and information leakage.
    * **Effort:** Identifying missing headers or weak configurations can be done with readily available automated tools, requiring low effort from the attacker. Exploiting these vulnerabilities generally requires medium effort.
    * **Skill Level:** Identifying missing headers requires a low skill level. Exploiting the resulting vulnerabilities requires a medium skill level.
* **Critical Node:** This node is critical because it represents a fundamental security weakness. If security headers are not properly configured, it opens the door to a range of attacks.

    * **Identify Missing Security Header (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options):**
        * Attackers can use simple tools or browser developer consoles to identify the absence of crucial security headers.
    * **Exploit Missing Header Vulnerability (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle downgrade attack, Clickjacking, MIME confusion):**
        * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Downgrade Attack:** Without HSTS, attackers can intercept the initial HTTP request and prevent the upgrade to HTTPS, allowing them to eavesdrop on communication.
        * **Clickjacking:** Without X-Frame-Options, attackers can embed the application within an `<iframe>` on a malicious website, tricking users into performing unintended actions.
        * **MIME Confusion:** Without X-Content-Type-Options, browsers might misinterpret file types, potentially executing malicious scripts disguised as other content.
    * **Identify Weak Security Header Configuration (e.g., overly permissive CSP, insecure Referrer-Policy):**
        * Attackers can analyze the `Content-Security-Policy` and `Referrer-Policy` headers to identify overly permissive directives.
    * **Exploit Weak Configuration (e.g., bypass CSP to inject malicious scripts, leak sensitive information via Referrer):**
        * **CSP Bypass:** Attackers can craft payloads that exploit weaknesses in the CSP, such as `unsafe-inline` being allowed or overly broad source whitelists, to inject and execute malicious JavaScript.
        * **Referrer Leakage:** Attackers can analyze the `Referer` header sent by the browser to understand the user's navigation and potentially extract sensitive information if the `Referrer-Policy` is not configured securely.

**High-Risk Path and Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Recommended Dependencies (Indirectly introduced by web's recommendations)**

* **High-Risk Path:** This path is considered high-risk because:
    * **Likelihood:**  Dependencies can become outdated and contain known vulnerabilities. If the `modernweb-dev/web` project recommends specific dependencies, and those recommendations are not kept up-to-date, the application becomes vulnerable.
    * **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies can have a severe impact, often leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
    * **Effort:** Identifying vulnerable dependencies is relatively easy using automated vulnerability scanning tools. Exploiting these vulnerabilities might require medium effort, especially if public exploits are available.
    * **Skill Level:** Identifying vulnerable dependencies requires a low skill level. Exploiting them might require a medium skill level.
* **Critical Node:** This node is critical because it highlights the risk associated with using third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can have a direct and significant impact on the application's security.

    * **Identify Vulnerable Dependency Recommended by web (e.g., outdated library with known security flaws):**
        * Attackers can use publicly available vulnerability databases (like CVE) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the application, especially if the `modernweb-dev/web` project recommends specific versions that are outdated.
    * **Exploit Dependency Vulnerability (e.g., Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS)):**
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can leverage known exploits for vulnerable dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities that cause the application or server to crash or become unresponsive, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
