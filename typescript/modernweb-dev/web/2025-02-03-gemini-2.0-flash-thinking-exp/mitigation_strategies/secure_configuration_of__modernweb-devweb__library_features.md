*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Identify Security-Sensitive Defaults:**  Specifically focus on default settings related to:
        *   **Secret Keys/Salts:** For encryption, session management, CSRF protection, etc.
        *   **Session Timeouts:**  Default session lengths might be too long.
        *   **Error Handling Verbosity:**  Default error messages might reveal sensitive information.
        *   **Default Ports/Paths:**  If configurable and security-relevant.
        *   **Logging Levels:** Default logging might be too verbose or insufficient for security auditing.
    *   **Generate Strong Secrets:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators to create strong, unique secret keys and salts.
    *   **Implement Secure Session Management:** Configure appropriate session timeouts, secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags), and consider session invalidation mechanisms.
    *   **Customize Error Handling:** Implement custom error pages that are user-friendly but avoid revealing sensitive technical details. Log detailed errors securely for debugging.
    *   **Review Default Documentation:** Carefully review the `modernweb-dev/web` library's documentation for recommended secure configuration practices and deviations from defaults.

**4. Secure Storage of Secrets for `web` Library:**

*   **Analysis:** Hardcoding secrets directly in configuration files or code is a major security vulnerability.  This step emphasizes the importance of secure secret management using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools. This prevents secrets from being easily discovered in version control systems, configuration files, or application deployments.
*   **Strengths:**  Significantly reduces the risk of secret exposure and credential compromise. Aligns with industry best practices for secret management.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Requires implementing and integrating a secure secret management solution, which can add complexity to the deployment process.  Developers need to be trained on secure secret handling practices.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Prioritize Environment Variables:** For simpler applications, environment variables are a good starting point for separating secrets from code and configuration files.
    *   **Consider Dedicated Secret Management Tools:** For more complex applications or production environments, utilize dedicated secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. These tools offer features like secret rotation, access control, and auditing.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding:**  Strictly prohibit hardcoding secrets in any configuration files, code, or version control systems.
    *   **Secure Access Control:** Implement proper access control mechanisms for secret management tools to restrict access to sensitive credentials to authorized personnel and applications only.
    *   **Secret Rotation:**  Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets, especially for long-lived credentials, to limit the impact of potential compromises.

**5. Regularly Review `web` Library Configurations:**
