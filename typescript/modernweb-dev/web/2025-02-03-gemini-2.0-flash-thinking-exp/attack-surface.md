# Attack Surface Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters due to insufficient sanitization within the `web` library's routing component, leading to malicious code injection or altered application behavior.
*   **How web contributes:** The `web` library's routing mechanism is the entry point for route parameters. If it lacks built-in sanitization or guidance for secure parameter handling, it directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A route defined using `web` like `/items/{itemId}` is vulnerable if `itemId` is directly used in a database query without validation. An attacker could inject `1 UNION SELECT password FROM users --` as `itemId` to attempt SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potentially server-side code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Input Validation within Application Logic:** Developers must implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters *after* they are parsed by the `web` library's routing.
    *   **Utilize Parameterized Queries/ORMs:**  Ensure database interactions use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection, regardless of how `web` handles routing.
    *   **Consult `web` Documentation:** Review `web` library's documentation for recommended practices on secure route parameter handling and any built-in sanitization features (if available).

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions if `web` integrates or provides a template engine and user-controlled data is embedded in templates without proper escaping.
*   **How web contributes:** If `web` includes a template engine or provides utilities for template integration, and doesn't enforce or guide developers towards secure template rendering practices (like automatic escaping), it directly contributes to SSTI risk.
*   **Example:** Using `web`'s templating feature, a template like `<h1>{{ userData.name }}</h1>` is vulnerable if `userData.name` is directly derived from user input and not escaped. An attacker could inject `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` as `userData.name` to execute JavaScript. In more severe cases, server-side code execution is possible.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, complete control over the application and server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Choose Secure Templating Practices:** If `web` offers templating, prioritize using secure templating practices. Ideally, use a template engine with automatic output escaping enabled by default.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Developers must always escape user-provided data before embedding it into templates, using context-aware encoding appropriate for the template engine and output format.
    *   **Avoid Raw Template Evaluation of User Input:**  Never directly evaluate user-provided input as template code within the application logic using `web`'s templating features.
    *   **Review `web` Templating Security:**  Thoroughly review `web` library's documentation regarding template engine security and recommended usage patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in `web`'s middleware pipeline implementation allow attackers to bypass security middleware, such as authentication or authorization, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **How web contributes:** If `web`'s middleware pipeline has logical vulnerabilities or allows for misconfigurations that lead to bypasses, the library itself is the direct contributor to this attack surface. The structure and implementation of the middleware system within `web` are key.
*   **Example:**  An authentication middleware is registered within `web`'s middleware pipeline to protect `/admin` routes. If a vulnerability in `web`'s middleware handling allows an attacker to craft a request that skips this middleware, they can access `/admin` without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, bypassing critical security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Middleware Configuration:** Developers must carefully configure middleware within `web`'s framework, ensuring correct order and application to intended routes.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Middleware Pipeline:**  Extensively test the middleware pipeline configuration and logic within applications using `web` to identify potential bypass scenarios.
    *   **Review `web` Middleware Implementation:**  If possible, review the source code or documentation of `web`'s middleware implementation to understand its limitations and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Middleware):** Design middleware to be specific and apply only to the routes they are intended to protect within the `web` application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations Leading to Information Exposure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_leading_to_information_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** `web` library's default settings might include insecure configurations that, if not overridden by developers, expose sensitive information or create vulnerabilities in deployed applications.
*   **How web contributes:** If `web` ships with defaults like verbose error logging in production, enabled debug modes, or overly permissive settings, it directly introduces this attack surface. The library's default configuration choices are the source of the risk.
*   **Example:** `web` might default to displaying detailed error messages in production, revealing internal paths, database connection strings, or other sensitive information to potential attackers.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, which can aid further attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in scenarios leading to significant information exposure)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Override Insecure Defaults:** Developers must explicitly override any insecure default configurations provided by `web` before deploying applications to production.
    *   **Secure Configuration Practices:** Follow secure configuration practices when using `web`, ensuring production environments have hardened settings (e.g., disabled debug modes, minimal error logging, strong security headers).
    *   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit the configuration of applications using `web` to ensure they adhere to security best practices and have overridden insecure defaults.
    *   **`web` Configuration Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review `web`'s documentation for recommended production configurations and security hardening guidelines.
