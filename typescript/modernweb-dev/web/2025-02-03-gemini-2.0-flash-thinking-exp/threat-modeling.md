# Threat Model Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependency_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used by `modernweb-dev/web`. This could be achieved by crafting malicious input that triggers the vulnerability, or by exploiting a publicly known exploit for the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impact can range from information disclosure, denial of service, to remote code execution on the client's browser or potentially the server if the vulnerability extends beyond the client-side library.
*   **Affected Component:**  `modernweb-dev/web` library and its dependencies (e.g., `npm` modules, browser APIs polyfilled by the library).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `modernweb-dev/web` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in the development pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for dependencies used by `modernweb-dev/web`.
    *   If a vulnerability is found and an update is not immediately available, consider workarounds or mitigations suggested by security advisories or the dependency maintainers.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Implementation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_component_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application through a vulnerability in a custom web component built using `modernweb-dev/web`. This could be done by exploiting insufficient input validation or improper output encoding in the component's code. The injected script then executes in the victim's browser when they interact with the component.
*   **Impact:**  XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially gaining access to sensitive user data or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom Web Components developed using `modernweb-dev/web` (specifically component templates, event handlers, and data binding mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation for all user inputs processed by web components.
    *   Use secure output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML escaping) when rendering user-provided data within components to prevent script injection.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews of custom web components, specifically looking for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Threat: [Client-Side Injection via API Misuse](./threats/client-side_injection_via_api_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a misused API or feature of `modernweb-dev/web` to inject malicious content or code into the client-side application. This could involve using library features in an insecure way that allows for DOM manipulation leading to injection, or improper handling of events that allows for event handler injection.
*   **Impact:** Similar to XSS, client-side injection can lead to script execution, data theft, session hijacking, and application defacement. The specific impact depends on the nature of the injected content and the attacker's goals.
*   **Affected Component:**  `modernweb-dev/web` library APIs related to DOM manipulation, event handling, data binding, or any feature that allows dynamic content rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (High severity is considered for this list).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand the security implications of all `modernweb-dev/web` APIs used.
    *   Follow the library's documentation and best practices for secure API usage.
    *   Avoid using APIs in ways that could lead to dynamic HTML construction from untrusted sources without proper sanitization.
    *   Implement input validation and output encoding even when using library-provided APIs, especially when dealing with user-provided data.
