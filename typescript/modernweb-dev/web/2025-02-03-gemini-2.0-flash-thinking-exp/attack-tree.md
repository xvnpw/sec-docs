## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Weaknesses Introduced by 'web' Template](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_weaknesses_introduced_by_'web'_template.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root of the high-risk attack tree. It signifies the attacker's primary focus on exploiting vulnerabilities that are specifically related to the `modernweb-dev/web` template itself, rather than general web application weaknesses. Success here means the attacker has found and leveraged a flaw stemming from the template's design, code, or configurations.
*   **Attack Vectors (leading to this node):**
    *   Exploiting Default Configurations (detailed below)
    *   Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities (detailed below)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_exploit_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because default configurations are often overlooked by developers and can contain significant security flaws. It's a high-risk path because it's often easy for attackers to identify and exploit these misconfigurations. Templates, designed for quick setup, may prioritize ease of use over secure defaults.
*   **Attack Vectors (within this path):**
    *   **Identify Default Credentials:**
        *   **Find Hardcoded Credentials in Code/Config Files:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers search configuration files (like `.env`, `config.js`, etc.) and source code for hardcoded usernames, passwords, API keys, database credentials, or other secrets left in by the template developers as examples or defaults.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Templates often include example configurations, and developers may forget to change them.
            *   **Impact:** High - Full application compromise if admin credentials or database access is obtained.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Simple file inspection.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic scripting or manual file searching.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Hardcoded secrets can be missed in code reviews and are not always logged.
    *   **Exploit Default API Keys/Secrets:**
        *   **Description:** Templates might include default API keys for services (e.g., cloud services, third-party APIs) for demonstration purposes. If these are not changed, attackers can use them to access the application's resources or associated services.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Templates might include example API integrations with default keys.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Unauthorized access to specific functionalities or data depending on the API.
        *   **Effort:** Low - Configuration file inspection.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of APIs.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Usage of default API keys might blend in with legitimate traffic initially.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node and a high-risk path because modern web applications rely heavily on third-party libraries and packages (dependencies). Templates might include outdated or vulnerable dependencies. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can lead to severe compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors (within this path):**
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers identify outdated dependencies in the `package.json` (or equivalent) file of the template. They then check public vulnerability databases (like CVE, NVD, or `npm audit` reports) for known vulnerabilities in those specific versions. If vulnerabilities exist, they research and attempt to exploit them in the context of the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Templates might not always be updated with the latest dependency versions.
        *   **Impact:** High - Ranging from code execution to data breaches, depending on the vulnerability.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires dependency analysis and exploit research.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Understanding of dependency management and vulnerability exploitation.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Vulnerability scanners can detect outdated dependencies, but exploit attempts might be harder to detect initially without proper intrusion detection systems.
