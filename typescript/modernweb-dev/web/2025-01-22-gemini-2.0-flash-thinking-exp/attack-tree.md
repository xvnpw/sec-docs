## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weaknesses Introduced by 'web' Template](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_weaknesses_introduced_by_'web'_template.md)

**Description:** This is the root of the attack tree and represents the overall goal of exploiting vulnerabilities specifically arising from the use of the `modernweb-dev/web` template. It's critical because it encompasses all template-related attack vectors.
*   **Attack Vectors (summarized from sub-tree):**
    *   Exploiting Default Configurations
    *   Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   (And other potential template-specific weaknesses, though Default Configurations and Dependencies are identified as high-risk)
*   **Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Templates, by nature, provide a common starting point, making template-specific vulnerabilities potentially widespread across applications using them.
*   **Mitigation:** Thorough security review of the template, providing security guidance to users, and regular updates to the template itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Default Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_default_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting insecure default settings that might be present in the `modernweb-dev/web` template. It's critical because default configurations are often overlooked by developers and can provide easy access for attackers.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify Default Credentials -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Find Hardcoded Credentials in Code/Config Files:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Attacker analyzes configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.js`) and source code (especially backend initialization scripts) within the template or generated application.
            *   Attacker searches for hardcoded usernames, passwords, API keys, database credentials, or other secrets that might be left as default values.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Unauthorized access to administrative panels, databases, APIs, or other sensitive parts of the application. Full system compromise if admin credentials are obtained.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Default credentials are notoriously easy to find and exploit. Templates often include placeholder credentials for demonstration purposes, which can be accidentally left in production. Low effort and skill required for attackers.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Mandatory Password Changes:** Force users to change default passwords upon initial setup.
            *   **Remove Default Credentials:** Ensure the template does not include any default, hardcoded credentials in configuration files or code.
            *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Guide users to use environment variables or secure secrets management for sensitive configuration.
            *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit configuration files and code for accidentally hardcoded secrets.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Default API Keys/Secrets:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Attacker locates default API keys or secrets within configuration files of the template or generated application.
            *   Attacker uses these default API keys to access protected API endpoints or resources, bypassing intended authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to API functionalities, data manipulation, data exfiltration, potentially leading to broader system compromise depending on API access levels.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Similar to default credentials, default API keys are easily discoverable and can grant significant access. Templates might include example API keys for testing or demonstration, which should never be used in production.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **No Default API Keys:**  Template should not include any default API keys.
            *   **API Key Rotation and Management:**  Guide users on secure API key generation, rotation, and management practices.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure API keys only grant necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by the `modernweb-dev/web` template. It's critical because dependency vulnerabilities are common, often severe, and can be easily exploited if dependencies are not kept up-to-date.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify Outdated Dependencies -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Attacker analyzes the `package.json` (or equivalent dependency manifest) of the template or generated application to identify dependency versions.
            *   Attacker compares these versions against public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, npm audit reports) to find known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies.
            *   Attacker researches and obtains exploits for the identified vulnerabilities.
            *   Attacker attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities within the context of the application built using the template.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, privilege escalation, depending on the specific vulnerability. Dependency vulnerabilities can be very severe and impact core application functionality.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Dependency vulnerabilities are prevalent and well-documented. Tools like `npm audit` make it easy to identify outdated and vulnerable dependencies. Exploits are often publicly available. Low skill and effort for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning in development and CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using `npm audit`, Snyk, or similar tools).
            *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies to the latest secure versions.
            *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies used by the application.
            *   **Dependency Review:**  Review dependencies before adding them to the project, considering their security track record and maintenance status.
