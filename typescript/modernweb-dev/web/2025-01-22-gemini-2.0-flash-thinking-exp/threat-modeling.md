# Threat Model Analysis for modernweb-dev/web

## Threat: [Framework Code Bugs leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/framework_code_bugs_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the `modernweb-dev/web` framework's core code, such as in its routing logic, request handling, or internal modules. By sending a specially crafted request, the attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be due to buffer overflows, injection flaws within framework components, or logic errors in core functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the server, steal sensitive data, modify application functionality, install malware, or cause complete service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Core Framework (Routing, Request Handling, Module System, potentially core utilities)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately update `modernweb-dev/web` to the latest version upon release, especially security patches.
    *   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for `modernweb-dev/web`.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data handled by the application, even if processed by the framework.
    *   Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing focusing on framework-specific functionalities and potential code vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Framework Logic Bugs leading to Authentication or Authorization Bypass](./threats/framework_logic_bugs_leading_to_authentication_or_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit logical flaws within the `modernweb-dev/web` framework's (or framework-influenced) authentication or authorization mechanisms. This could involve manipulating request parameters in a way that bypasses access control checks defined by the framework or application, exploiting session management weaknesses introduced by the framework, or finding loopholes in the framework's permission handling logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data, modify user accounts, perform administrative actions, or escalate their privileges within the application without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication/Authorization Modules (if provided or influenced by framework), Routing System (if routing rules impact authorization), Middleware (if framework encourages auth middleware with vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement and rigorously test authentication and authorization logic, ensuring it adheres to security best practices and is not easily bypassed.
    *   Carefully review and understand the framework's security features and limitations related to authentication and authorization, avoiding reliance on potentially flawed framework-specific mechanisms if better alternatives exist.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege and enforce strong, role-based access control policies within the application, independent of framework defaults.
    *   Utilize well-established and security-audited authentication and authorization libraries or middleware, rather than relying on custom or potentially less secure framework-specific implementations.

## Threat: [Framework-Specific Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/framework-specific_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit specific features or inefficiencies within the `modernweb-dev/web` framework to cause a Denial of Service. This might involve crafting requests that trigger computationally expensive operations within the framework's routing system, middleware pipeline, or server-side rendering engine, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) and making the application unresponsive to legitimate users. For example, inefficient routing algorithms or resource-intensive default middleware could be targeted.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability for legitimate users, resulting in business disruption, reputational damage, and potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Affected Component:** Routing System (inefficient route matching), Middleware (resource-intensive default middleware), Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Engine (unoptimized SSR processes if part of framework), Request Handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Optimize application code and framework configurations for performance and resource efficiency, paying special attention to areas potentially impacted by framework design choices (e.g., SSR, routing).
    *   Implement robust rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe, mitigating abuse.
    *   Employ caching mechanisms, especially for server-side rendered content if applicable, to reduce server load and response times.
    *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts to detect and respond to unusual spikes in resource consumption that might indicate a DoS attack.
    *   Conduct performance testing and stress testing to identify potential DoS vulnerabilities related to framework features and application logic.

## Threat: [Server-Side XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in SSR Output](./threats/server-side_xss__cross-site_scripting__in_ssr_output.md)

*   **Description:** If `modernweb-dev/web` encourages or utilizes server-side rendering (SSR) and user-provided data is not properly handled during the SSR process, it could lead to Server-Side XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through user input that is then rendered directly into the HTML output on the server. When a user's browser receives and renders this server-generated HTML, the injected script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users, or deface the application. This is especially relevant if the framework's templating engine or SSR utilities do not enforce proper output escaping by default.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information, defacement of the application, and potential spread of malware.
*   **Affected Component:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Engine (if framework provides), Templating Engine (if used by framework or recommended), Data Handling within SSR components/views.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mandatory and robust output encoding and sanitization for all user-provided data that is rendered on the server-side during SSR.
    *   Utilize templating engines with built-in, context-aware XSS protection and ensure they are correctly configured and used.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for SSR, treating all user input as untrusted and explicitly escaping it before including it in the rendered HTML.
    *   Implement and enforce a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
