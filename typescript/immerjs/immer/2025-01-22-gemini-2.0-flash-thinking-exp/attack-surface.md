# Attack Surface Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:** Prototype pollution allows attackers to modify the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects (like `Object.prototype`), potentially causing application-wide disruptions and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Immer Contribution:** Immer's use of JavaScript proxies to enable mutable operations on immutable data introduces a potential attack surface. Vulnerabilities in Immer's proxy handling or change tracking logic, especially when processing user-controlled input, could be exploited to pollute prototypes.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when processed by Immer during an update operation, exploits a vulnerability in Immer's proxy mechanism to inject a property like `__proto__.polluted = true` into `Object.prototype`. This could lead to all objects in the application inheriting the `polluted` property, causing unexpected behavior or security bypasses.
*   **Impact:** Application-wide disruption, potential security bypasses (e.g., authentication or authorization), information disclosure, or even remote code execution in severe cases depending on the polluted property and application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Immer Updated:** Regularly update Immer to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before it is processed by Immer, especially data influencing object keys or property names. Restrict allowed characters and data structures.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of prototype pollution by limiting JavaScript execution capabilities and preventing loading of external resources.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make an application unavailable by overwhelming it with requests or consuming excessive resources.
*   **Immer Contribution:** Immer's change detection and patching mechanisms can become resource-intensive when processing extremely large or deeply nested objects, particularly with complex update operations. Maliciously crafted input can exploit this to cause DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a very large JSON payload with deeply nested objects to an endpoint that uses Immer to process and update application state. This could force Immer to perform extensive deep copying and change detection, consuming excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to application slowdown or crash.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, degraded performance for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size and complexity of input data processed by Immer. Reject requests exceeding predefined thresholds.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe, preventing attackers from overwhelming the application with malicious payloads.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure resource quotas (CPU, memory) for the application to prevent a single process from consuming all available resources and impacting other services.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor application performance and resource usage to detect anomalies and potential DoS attacks early.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Bugs in Immer's Core Logic](./attack_surfaces/logic_bugs_in_immer's_core_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Immer, like any software, might contain undiscovered logic bugs in its core implementation related to proxy handling, change detection, patching, or other internal mechanisms. These bugs could be exploited to cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Immer Contribution:** The complexity of Immer's internal logic, especially around proxy management and change tracking, increases the potential for subtle logic errors that could be exploited.
*   **Example:** A specific sequence of Immer operations, combined with a particular data structure, triggers an unexpected edge case in Immer's change detection algorithm. This could lead to data corruption, incorrect state updates, or even security vulnerabilities if it bypasses intended access controls or data validation logic within the application.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, unexpected behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if logic bugs lead to unintended data manipulation or access control bypasses.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Immer updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the Immer maintainers.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing of the application's integration with Immer, especially with complex data structures, edge cases, and various update scenarios. Include fuzzing and property-based testing where applicable.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Perform code reviews to identify potential logic flaws in the application code that interacts with Immer and ensure correct usage of the Immer API.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential logic errors and vulnerabilities in code that uses Immer.
