# Threat Model Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Threat: [Threat 1: Malicious Draft Mutation After Immer Finalization](./threats/threat_1_malicious_draft_mutation_after_immer_finalization.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Draft Mutation After Immer Finalization
*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., XSS, prototype pollution) to gain control and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context. This malicious code then intentionally obtains a reference to an Immer draft object (perhaps through memory inspection or by exploiting a vulnerability that leaks draft references) *after* Immer has finalized the state and mutates it.
    *   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to inject and execute malicious JavaScript. This code then targets Immer's draft mechanism to manipulate application state outside of intended Immer operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of application state integrity.
    *   Potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized actions if state manipulation leads to bypassing security checks.
    *   Data breaches or manipulation of sensitive information if stored in the application state.
*   **Affected Immer Component:** `produce` function, Draft object (proxy), potentially Immer's internal memory management if exploited to leak draft references.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Prevent XSS and other injection vulnerabilities that could allow execution of malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS risks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to inject malicious code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the impact of compromised code by limiting the privileges and access rights of the application.
    *   **Developer Education:** Educate developers on common web security vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
