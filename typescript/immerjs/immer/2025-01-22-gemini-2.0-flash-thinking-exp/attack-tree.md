## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities Amplified by Immer](./attack_tree_paths/1___high_risk_path__1__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities_amplified_by_immer.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path represents exploiting vulnerabilities that are fundamentally within the application's own logic, but are made more relevant or impactful due to the way Immer is used for state management.  Immer doesn't introduce these logic flaws, but it provides a framework where these flaws can lead to state manipulation and potential compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. Logic Errors in Producer Functions](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__1_1__logic_errors_in_producer_functions.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path focuses on errors within the producer functions that are central to Immer's operation.  If producer functions contain flawed logic, they can be manipulated to cause unintended state changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Incorrect State Updates due to flawed logic](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__1_1_1__incorrect_state_updates_due_to_flawed_logic.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path is a specific type of logic error in producer functions where the logic for updating the state is flawed, leading to incorrect or unintended state modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.1.1. Manipulate input data to trigger unintended state changes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__1_1_1_1__manipulate_input_data_to_trigger_unintended_state_changes__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector Description:**

*   An attacker crafts malicious input data designed to be processed by a producer function.
*   The producer function, due to flawed logic or lack of input validation, processes this malicious data in a way that causes unintended and potentially harmful changes to the application state.
*   This could lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, bypassing security checks, or other forms of compromise depending on the application's logic and state structure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium-High
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test producer functions with varied and potentially malicious inputs.
    *   Implement robust input validation *before* data reaches producer functions.
    *   Design producer functions to be resilient to unexpected or malformed data.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.2. Incorrect Assumptions about Immutability and Draft Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/5___high_risk_path__1_1_2__incorrect_assumptions_about_immutability_and_draft_behavior.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path arises from developers misunderstanding or incorrectly applying the principles of immutability and Immer's draft mechanism.  Incorrect assumptions can lead to coding errors that create vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.2.1. Modifying original state directly (bypassing Immer) leading to inconsistencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node__1_1_2_1__modifying_original_state_directly__bypassing_immer__leading_to_inconsist_fcf75717.md)

**Attack Vector Description:**

*   Developers mistakenly modify the original immutable state object directly, instead of using Immer's producer functions.
*   This bypasses Immer's change tracking and structural sharing, breaking immutability and leading to inconsistent state.
*   If state consistency is critical for security or application logic, this inconsistency can be exploited to cause vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce immutability principles throughout the application development process.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews to identify and prevent direct state mutations.
    *   Utilize linters or static analysis tools to detect potential direct state modifications.
    *   Educate developers on the importance of immutability and proper Immer usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.2.2. Incorrectly applying patches or using `applyPatches` leading to state corruption](./attack_tree_paths/7___high_risk_path__1_2_2_2__incorrectly_applying_patches_or_using__applypatches__leading_to_state_c_1c7171c8.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path focuses on the risks associated with Immer's patch functionality. Incorrectly generated, manipulated, or unsanitized patches can corrupt the application state when applied.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. [CRITICAL NODE] Likelihood: Low, Impact: Medium-High (Data Corruption), Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Medium, Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Data Integrity Checks Needed) [HIGH RISK] at 1.2.2.2.](./attack_tree_paths/8___critical_node__likelihood_low__impact_medium-high__data_corruption___effort_medium__skill_level__98b36975.md)

**Attack Vector Description:**

*   An attacker provides malicious or malformed patches to the application.
*   The application, without proper validation or sanitization, applies these patches using `applyPatches`.
*   The malicious patches corrupt the application state, potentially leading to data integrity issues, logic errors, or even security vulnerabilities if the corrupted state is used in security-sensitive operations.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Data Corruption)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires Data Integrity Checks)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all patches before applying them using `applyPatches`.
    *   Implement robust error handling for patch application to prevent state corruption in case of invalid patches.
    *   If patches are received from untrusted sources, exercise extreme caution and consider alternative approaches to state updates if possible.
    *   Implement data integrity checks to detect state corruption after patch application.
