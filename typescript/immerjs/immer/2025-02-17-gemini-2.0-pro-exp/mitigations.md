# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Restrict Immer to Plain Objects and Arrays](./mitigation_strategies/1__restrict_immer_to_plain_objects_and_arrays.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Code Review Policy:** Enforce a code review policy that requires careful scrutiny of *any* usage of Immer with non-plain objects (objects with custom classes, getters/setters, Proxies).  The `produce` function should ideally only receive plain JavaScript objects and arrays.
2.  **Data Transformation (Pre-Immer):** If you *must* work with complex objects, transform them into plain object representations *before* passing them to Immer's `produce` function. This might involve extracting the necessary data into a new plain object or creating a simplified data structure.  Do *not* pass the complex object directly to `produce`.
3.  **Alternative State Management (If Necessary):** If managing the state of complex objects is a frequent and unavoidable requirement, strongly consider using a different state management solution that is explicitly designed for handling complex object graphs and their specific behaviors. Immer is optimized for plain data.
4.  **Documentation:** If, after careful consideration, you *must* use Immer with a non-plain object (and have exhausted all other options), clearly document this exception. Explain the rationale, the specific non-plain object type, and any potential risks or limitations. This documentation should be easily discoverable.
5.  **Unit Tests (Targeted):** If you are forced to use Immer with non-plain objects, create dedicated unit tests that specifically target the interaction between Immer and that specific object type. These tests should cover edge cases and potential interactions with the object's internal methods (getters, setters, etc.).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Non-Plain Objects:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents Immer from behaving unpredictably due to interactions with complex object features (getters/setters, Proxies, custom methods). Immer's internal logic might not correctly handle these features, leading to incorrect state updates or unexpected side effects.
    *   **Potential Security Loopholes (Indirect):** (Severity: Low-Medium) - Reduces the risk of subtle security vulnerabilities that might arise from unexpected interactions between Immer and the internal logic of complex objects. If the complex object's methods have security implications, Immer's handling (or mishandling) of them could create vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Significantly improves the predictability and reliability of Immer by limiting its usage to its intended domain (plain objects and arrays).
    *   **Potential Security Loopholes:** Reduces the risk of subtle security vulnerabilities, although this is a secondary benefit compared to the primary goal of preventing unexpected behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Informal guideline to prefer plain objects.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review policy specifically addressing this issue.
    *   Consistent and enforced data transformation for complex objects *before* they reach Immer.
    *   Standardized documentation for any exceptions.
    *   Targeted unit tests for any non-plain object interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. `setAutoFreeze(false)` and `enablePatches(true)` Review and Control](./mitigation_strategies/2___setautofreeze_false___and__enablepatches_true___review_and_control.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Usage:** Systematically search the entire codebase for any instances of `setAutoFreeze(false)` and `enablePatches(true)` in calls to Immer's configuration functions.
2.  **Justify and Document (Strictly):** For *each* instance found, there must be a clear, detailed, and easily discoverable justification for disabling auto-freezing or enabling patches. The documentation *must* explain:
    *   *Why* the default Immer behavior is being overridden.
    *   The specific risks associated with this deviation.
    *   The alternative approaches considered and why they were rejected.
    *   The expected behavior and any limitations.
3.  **Minimize Usage (Refactor if Possible):** Actively try to refactor the code to *avoid* disabling auto-freezing or enabling patches. Explore alternative code designs and data structures that allow you to use Immer with its default (and safer) settings.
4.  **Mandatory Code Review:** Enforce a *mandatory* code review for *any* code change that involves `setAutoFreeze(false)` or `enablePatches(true)`. This review should be performed by a senior developer with a strong understanding of Immer and its security implications.
5.  **Unit Tests (Targeted and Comprehensive):** If these features *must* be used, write comprehensive unit tests that specifically target the modified behavior. These tests should:
    *   Verify the intended behavior when auto-freezing is disabled or patches are enabled.
    *   Ensure that no unintended side effects or vulnerabilities are introduced.
    *   Cover edge cases and potential interactions with other parts of the application.
6.  **Patch Handling (Strict Validation, if `enablePatches(true)`):** If patches are enabled, implement *strict* validation and sanitization of *any* patches received from external sources (e.g., user input, API responses) *before* applying them using `applyPatches`. Treat patches as completely untrusted input.  This validation should include:
    *   **Schema Validation:** Define a schema for the expected structure of patches and validate incoming patches against this schema.
    *   **Content Sanitization:** Sanitize the contents of the patches to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters or code.
    *   **Origin Verification:** If possible, verify the origin of the patches to ensure they come from a trusted source.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Mutations (with `setAutoFreeze(false)`):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents accidental modifications to the draft state *outside* of the `produce` callback.  Disabling auto-freezing removes Immer's built-in protection against this, increasing the risk of bugs and potential vulnerabilities if the draft state is inadvertently modified elsewhere.
    *   **Malicious Patches (with `enablePatches(true)`):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or modifying the application's state in unintended ways by manipulating the contents of patches. If patches are enabled and not properly validated, they can be a powerful attack vector.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Mutations:** Reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities caused by accidental state mutations, restoring the safety guarantees that Immer normally provides.
    *   **Malicious Patches:** Significantly reduces the risk of attacks that exploit the patch mechanism, making it much harder for attackers to compromise the application through this vector.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None of these features are currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review policy and strict documentation requirements for these features are not in place (proactive measure, even though they are not currently used).
    *   Targeted and comprehensive unit tests are not present (proactive).
    *   Robust patch validation and sanitization procedures are not defined (relevant only if `enablePatches(true)` were to be used).

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Input Validation Specific to Immer's `produce`](./mitigation_strategies/3__input_validation_specific_to_immer's__produce_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify all entry points:** Find all places in the code where `produce` is called.
2.  **Schema Definition:** For each entry point, define a strict schema that describes the expected shape and types of the *initial state* passed to `produce`. Use TypeScript interfaces, JSON Schema, or a similar validation mechanism.
3.  **Pre-`produce` Validation:** *Before* calling `produce`, validate the initial state against the defined schema. If the validation fails, reject the input and handle the error appropriately (e.g., log the error, return an error response). Do *not* call `produce` with invalid data.
4.  **Deep Copy (Defensive):** Even after validation, create a deep copy of the initial state using a reliable deep-copying library (like `lodash.clonedeep`) *before* passing it to `produce`. This provides an extra layer of defense against potential mutations or exploits.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (Indirect, via Malformed Input):** (Severity: High) - By ensuring that only well-formed and validated data is passed to `produce`, you reduce the likelihood of triggering vulnerabilities in Immer's internal handling of object structures. Maliciously crafted input designed to exploit such vulnerabilities would be rejected.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Due to Invalid Input):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents Immer from behaving unpredictably due to malformed or invalid input data. This improves the overall reliability and stability of the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that only validated data interacts with Immer's core logic.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Improves the reliability and predictability of Immer by preventing it from processing invalid data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type checking with TypeScript is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal data schemas are not defined for all `produce` entry points.
    *   Dedicated validation library is not used for pre-`produce` validation.
    *   Deep copying before `produce` is not consistently implemented.
