## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Craft Malicious Recipe Function [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__craft_malicious_recipe_function__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the input to the `produce` function's recipe to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior. This is a critical attack vector because recipe functions often receive user-controlled data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for Code Execution or Data Corruption)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Sanitize all inputs to the recipe function.
    *   Use schema validation to enforce the expected structure of the state and inputs.
    *   Avoid using user-provided data directly within the recipe without thorough validation.
    *   Be extremely cautious about dynamic code generation within the recipe.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Craft Malicious Patches [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__craft_malicious_patches__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `applyPatches`, an attacker could craft malicious patches to modify the state in unauthorized ways. This is critical if patches come from untrusted sources or are not properly validated.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Data Corruption, potentially Code Execution if combined with other vulnerabilities)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Validate the structure and content of *all* patches before applying them.
    *   Do *not* apply patches from untrusted sources.
    *   Use a schema to define the expected format of patches.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization to control who can submit patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.2. Cause Denial of Service via Large/Complex Patches [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2__cause_denial_of_service_via_largecomplex_patches__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends very large or computationally expensive patches to the `applyPatches` function, overwhelming the application and causing a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict limits on the size and complexity of patches.
    *   Use rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the application with patch requests.
    *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) to detect potential DoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Disable Auto-Freezing and Mutate State Directly [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__disable_auto-freezing_and_mutate_state_directly__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers disable Immer's `setAutoFreeze` feature and then accidentally (or intentionally) mutate the state directly, bypassing Immer's immutability protections.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Corruption, Unexpected Behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with linting and testing)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid disabling `setAutoFreeze` unless absolutely necessary and with a very clear, documented reason.
    *   Use linting rules (e.g., ESLint with Immer-specific plugins) to detect direct mutations.
    *   Thoroughly test any code where auto-freezing is disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Leak Sensitive Information in Patches [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__leak_sensitive_information_in_patches__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** If `enablePatches` is used, and patches are transmitted over a network or stored, sensitive information included in the patches could be exposed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Breach)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if monitoring network traffic or patch storage)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Be extremely careful about what data is included in patches.
    *   Avoid including sensitive data in patches if possible.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within patches if necessary.
    *   Implement proper access controls for patch storage and transmission.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2. Replay Attacks with Patches [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2__replay_attacks_with_patches__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and re-applies previously valid patches to manipulate the application state.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Corruption, Unexpected Behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with logging and auditing)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to prevent patch replay, such as:
        *   Unique identifiers for each patch.
        *   Timestamps and sequence numbers.
        *   Server-side tracking of applied patches.
    *   Validate that patches are applied in the correct order and only once.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Accidental Mutation of Draft Outside Recipe [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__accidental_mutation_of_draft_outside_recipe__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally modify the draft state *outside* of the `produce` function's recipe, breaking Immer's immutability guarantees.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Corruption, Unexpected Behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with linting and testing)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly adhere to the pattern of *only* modifying the draft state *within* the recipe function.
    *   Use linting rules to detect accidental mutations outside the recipe.
    *   Thorough code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2. Returning Modified Draft Directly [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2__returning_modified_draft_directly__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers return the modified draft object directly from the recipe function, instead of letting Immer handle the return value. This breaks immutability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Corruption, Unexpected Behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with linting and testing)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Always* allow Immer to handle the return value of the recipe function.  Never return the draft directly.
    *   Use linting rules to enforce this pattern.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.3. Storing References to Draft Objects [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_3__storing_references_to_draft_objects__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers store references to objects *inside* the draft state outside of the recipe function. These references become invalid after the recipe completes.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected Behavior, Potential Data Corruption)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with careful code review and debugging)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Do *not* store references to objects within the draft state outside the recipe.
    *   If you need to access data from the draft, copy it out explicitly.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Incorrect Serialization/Deserialization of Immer-Managed State [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__incorrect_serializationdeserialization_of_immer-managed_state__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** When serializing Immer-managed state (e.g., for storage or network transmission), using a method that doesn't correctly handle frozen objects and proxies can lead to data corruption or loss of immutability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Data Corruption, Unexpected Behavior)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with thorough testing)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a serialization library that is known to be compatible with Immer (and frozen objects/proxies in general).
    *   Thoroughly test the serialization/deserialization process to ensure that immutability is preserved.
    *   Consider using Immer's `original` function to get a plain JavaScript copy of the state *before* serialization, if necessary and appropriate.  Be aware that this breaks the connection to the original Immer-managed state.
