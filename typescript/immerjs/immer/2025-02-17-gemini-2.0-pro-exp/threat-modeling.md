# Threat Model Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Threat: [produce Function Hijacking](./threats/produce_function_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** `produce` Function Hijacking

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context (this pre-existing vulnerability is a prerequisite, but the *target* of the attack is Immer). They overwrite or monkey-patch the `immer.produce` function (or crucial internal functions like those handling freezing or patching) with malicious code. This malicious code intercepts all state updates, allowing the attacker to:
        *   Modify the data being passed to the reducer function.
        *   Alter the resulting state before it's finalized.
        *   Steal sensitive information from the draft state.
        *   Cause arbitrary application behavior by manipulating the state in unexpected ways.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of state management integrity.
        *   Data manipulation leading to incorrect application behavior, potential authorization bypasses, or data corruption.
        *   Information disclosure if sensitive data is exfiltrated from the draft.
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution *within the context of state updates*.
    *   **Immer Component Affected:** `produce` function, core internal functions related to freezing and patching.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but requires a pre-existing vulnerability to inject the malicious code).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** A robust CSP is the *primary* defense. It should prevent the execution of any unauthorized JavaScript, making it extremely difficult to modify Immer's functions.  Specifically, disallow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If Immer is loaded from a CDN, use SRI to verify the integrity of the loaded script. This ensures that the attacker cannot tamper with the Immer library itself *in transit*.
        *   **Secure Build Process:** Ensure the build process is secure and dependencies are verified to prevent compromised versions of Immer from being included.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Evaluation:** Eliminate any use of `eval` or `new Function` in the application, as these are common injection vectors.
        *   **Code Signing (where applicable):** For environments like browser extensions, code signing can prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Incorrect `produce` Usage - Bypassing Intended State Update Logic (Leading to Security Issues)](./threats/incorrect__produce__usage_-_bypassing_intended_state_update_logic__leading_to_security_issues_.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect `produce` Usage - Bypassing Intended State Update Logic (Leading to Security Issues)

    *   **Description:** While *technically* a misuse, this is included because it directly interacts with Immer's core functionality and can have *high* security implications. A developer, misunderstanding Immer's intended workflow, introduces code that bypasses the normal `produce` callback mechanism for modifying the draft. This might involve:
        1.  Passing the `draft` to an external, untrusted function that modifies it in ways that violate application invariants or security constraints.
        2.  Creating complex logic *within* the `produce` callback that circumvents intended validation or authorization checks that *should* have been part of the state update process. The developer mistakenly believes Immer's immutability guarantees are sufficient, neglecting higher-level security logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   State corruption, leading to inconsistent application behavior.
        *   *Bypass of security checks* (e.g., authorization, input validation) that were intended to be part of the state update process. This can lead to privilege escalation or other security vulnerabilities.
        *   Difficult-to-debug issues, as the state modifications are happening in an unexpected way.
    *   **Immer Component Affected:** `produce` function (incorrect usage and interaction with the `draft`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it can directly lead to security vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TypeScript:** Using TypeScript with Immer is *crucial*.  It provides strong type checking that can prevent many common errors related to draft manipulation.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Rigorous code reviews are essential. Reviewers should specifically look for:
            *   Any code that passes the `draft` to external functions.
            *   Complex logic within the `produce` callback that might be circumventing intended security checks.
            *   Any direct mutation of the `draft` outside the intended update flow.
        *   **Unit and Integration Testing:** Tests should specifically verify that:
            *   Security checks are correctly enforced during state updates.
            *   The `draft` is not being modified in unexpected ways.
            *   Application invariants are maintained after all state transitions.
        *   **Linter Rules:** Consider custom linter rules to:
            *   Forbid passing the `draft` to external functions.
            *   Flag overly complex logic within `produce` callbacks.
        *   **Clear Coding Guidelines:** Document best practices for using Immer, emphasizing the importance of keeping state update logic simple and secure.
