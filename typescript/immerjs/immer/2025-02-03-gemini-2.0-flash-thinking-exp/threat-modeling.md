# Threat Model Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested or Extremely Large State Structures](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_or_extremely_large_state_structures.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or injects input data designed to create extremely large or deeply nested state structures within the application. When Immer's `produce` function processes this data, it can lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption due to Immer's proxying and structural sharing mechanisms. This resource exhaustion can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash, denying service to legitimate users.
**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, leading to business disruption, loss of service, and potential reputational damage. In critical systems, DoS can have severe consequences.
**Immer Component Affected:** `produce` function, Proxy mechanism, Structural Sharing
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to reject or limit the size and nesting depth of data that becomes part of the application state.
* **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Implement resource limits (memory, CPU) for processes handling Immer operations. Monitor resource usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
* **Performance Testing and Optimization:** Conduct thorough performance testing with large and complex state structures to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks related to Immer. Consider alternative state management strategies if Immer proves to be a performance bottleneck for very large datasets.
* **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:** Implement rate limiting or request throttling to limit the frequency of requests that could potentially trigger resource-intensive Immer operations.

## Threat: [Incorrect Handling of Patches Leading to State Desynchronization (Critical in Collaborative/Critical Systems)](./threats/incorrect_handling_of_patches_leading_to_state_desynchronization__critical_in_collaborativecritical__1551e192.md)

**Description:** In applications utilizing Immer's patch functionality for critical operations like collaborative editing, data replication, or audit trails, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the patch handling logic. This could involve injecting malicious patches, manipulating patch order, or causing patch application failures. If not handled correctly, this can lead to critical state desynchronization between different parts of the system or users.
**Impact:** Inconsistent data across the application, data corruption in critical systems, potential for data breaches or unauthorized modifications in collaborative environments, failure of audit trails, and loss of data integrity. In critical systems, state desynchronization can lead to catastrophic failures.
**Immer Component Affected:** `produce` function (patch generation), `applyPatches` function
**Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical in systems with high data integrity requirements or collaborative features with security implications)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Highly Robust and Audited Patch Application Logic:** Implement extremely robust and rigorously audited patch application logic. Ensure proper error handling, patch ordering, and validation.
* **Cryptographic Integrity Checks for Patches:** For critical systems, consider using cryptographic signatures or checksums to ensure patch integrity and authenticity, especially if patches are transmitted over networks or from untrusted sources.
* **Secure Patch Transmission Channels:** Use secure communication channels (HTTPS, WSS) for transmitting patches to prevent tampering in transit.
* **Comprehensive Testing and Security Reviews:** Conduct extensive testing of patch generation and application logic, including security-focused penetration testing and code reviews by security experts.
* **Rollback and Recovery Mechanisms:** Implement robust rollback and recovery mechanisms to revert to a consistent state in case of patch application failures or suspected malicious patch injection.
