# Attack Surface Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution via Proxy Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution_via_proxy_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in JavaScript proxy handling or Immer's proxy implementation to inject properties into built-in JavaScript prototypes (like `Object.prototype`). This can lead to application-wide vulnerabilities.

    *   **How Immer Contributes:** Immer heavily relies on JavaScript proxies. If there's a flaw in how Immer sets up or manages these proxies, or if the underlying JavaScript engine's proxy implementation has vulnerabilities that Immer's usage exposes, it could be exploited. Immer's complex proxy usage increases the surface area for potential proxy-related issues.

    *   **Example:**  Hypothetically, a vulnerability in Immer's proxy creation allows manipulation of the proxy's `[[Set]]` trap. By crafting specific input, an attacker bypasses Immer's intended behavior and sets a property on `Object.prototype` through the proxy. Setting `Object.prototype.isAdmin = true` could grant unauthorized admin privileges application-wide.

    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Prototype pollution can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial of service, potentially compromising the entire application and environment.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical. While direct prototype pollution in Immer is less likely, the potential impact is severe if such a vulnerability were to exist due to Immer's core proxy mechanism.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Immer Updated:** Regularly update Immer to the latest version for bug fixes and security patches addressing proxy-related vulnerabilities.
        *   **JavaScript Engine Updates:** Ensure the JavaScript engine (Node.js or browser) is up-to-date, as engine-level proxy vulnerabilities could indirectly affect Immer.
        *   **Static Analysis and Security Audits:** Use static analysis tools and conduct security audits to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities, especially around Immer usage and data handling.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Structures](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion_and_denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_structures.md)

*   **Description:**  Causing excessive memory consumption and CPU usage by providing extremely deeply nested data structures as input to Immer's producer function, leading to application slowdown or crash (DoS).

    *   **How Immer Contributes:** Immer's structural sharing, while efficient, can become computationally expensive with extreme nesting. Creating and modifying deep structures within Immer's producer requires traversing and potentially copying parts, consuming significant resources.

    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with thousands of levels of nested objects to an API endpoint using Immer for state updates. Immer processing this payload within its producer function leads to excessive memory allocation and CPU usage, slowing down or crashing the server/client.

    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Denial of Service disrupts application availability and impacts legitimate users, potentially leading to server crashes and data loss in severe cases.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (escalating to High in critical applications). DoS attacks are impactful, especially for critical applications exposed to untrusted input.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Limits:** Implement strict input validation and limits on the depth and size of data structures processed by Immer. Reject excessively nested/large payloads before Immer processing.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Limits:** Monitor server/client resource usage (CPU, memory) and set limits to prevent resource exhaustion. Implement rate limiting to mitigate DoS attempts.
