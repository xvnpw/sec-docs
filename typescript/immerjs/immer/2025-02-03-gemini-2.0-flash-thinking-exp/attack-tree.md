## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities Amplified by Immer (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities_amplified_by_immer__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that are primarily within the application's own logic, but are made more relevant or impactful by the use of Immer for state management. Immer itself doesn't introduce these logic flaws, but it provides a framework where these flaws can manifest in state manipulation, which is often central to application security.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Logic Errors in Producer Functions (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__logic_errors_in_producer_functions__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path specifically targets errors in the logic implemented within Immer producer functions. Producer functions are where state updates are defined, and flaws in their logic can directly lead to unintended and potentially exploitable state changes.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Incorrect State Updates due to flawed logic (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__incorrect_state_updates_due_to_flawed_logic__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path is a refinement of the previous one, focusing on the outcome of logic errors in producers: incorrect state updates. These incorrect updates can be the direct cause of vulnerabilities if they lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or bypassing security checks.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Manipulate input data to trigger unintended state changes (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__manipulate_input_data_to_trigger_unintended_state_changes__critical_node_-_high_risk_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious input data that, when processed by a flawed producer function, causes unintended modifications of the application state. This is a classic vulnerability pattern applicable to many applications, and Immer's producer functions are a potential point of entry if not carefully designed.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium-High
* **Effort:** Low-Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Mitigation:**
    * Thoroughly test producer functions with varied inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs.
    * Implement robust input validation *before* data reaches producer functions.
    * Apply principle of least privilege in state updates - only update what is strictly necessary and validate the changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Incorrect Assumptions about Immutability and Draft Behavior (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__incorrect_assumptions_about_immutability_and_draft_behavior__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path highlights vulnerabilities arising from developers' misunderstanding or incorrect application of Immer's immutability and draft concepts.  Incorrect assumptions can lead to code that unintentionally breaks immutability or misuses drafts, creating unexpected state behavior.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Modifying original state directly (bypassing Immer) leading to inconsistencies (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__modifying_original_state_directly__bypassing_immer__leading_to_inconsistencies__critical_no_d1dd1283.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly modify the original immutable state directly, bypassing Immer's mechanisms. This breaks immutability guarantees and can lead to unpredictable application behavior, especially if state consistency is critical for security.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Mitigation:**
    * Enforce immutability principles throughout the application development process.
    * Conduct regular code reviews to specifically look for and prevent direct state mutations outside of Immer producers.
    * Utilize linters and static analysis tools to detect potential direct state modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Incorrectly applying patches or using `applyPatches` leading to state corruption (HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__incorrectly_applying_patches_or_using__applypatches__leading_to_state_corruption__high_risk_b2494f3e.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on the risks associated with Immer's patch functionality. If patches are generated, transmitted, or applied incorrectly, or if malicious patches are introduced (especially from untrusted sources), it can lead to state corruption. State corruption can have wide-ranging and severe consequences for application security and functionality.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** Medium-High (Data Corruption)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires Data Integrity Checks)
* **Mitigation:**
    * Thoroughly validate and sanitize patches *before* applying them, especially if patches originate from external or untrusted sources.
    * Implement robust error handling for patch application to prevent cascading failures and state corruption in case of invalid patches.
    * Consider using cryptographic signatures or checksums to ensure patch integrity if patches are transmitted over networks or stored persistently.
    * Implement data integrity checks within the application to detect and potentially recover from state corruption if it occurs.
