# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Immer project is a JavaScript library that simplifies working with immutable data. Its primary goal is to enhance developer productivity and code maintainability by providing a more convenient and less error-prone way to manage immutable state in JavaScript applications.

* Business priorities:
  * Developer Experience: Make immutable state management easier and more intuitive for JavaScript developers.
  * Performance: Ensure the library is performant and does not introduce significant overhead to applications using it.
  * Reliability: Provide a stable and well-tested library that developers can depend on.
  * Community Adoption: Encourage widespread adoption within the JavaScript development community.

* Business goals:
  * Increase developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code for immutable updates.
  * Improve code readability and maintainability by simplifying immutable state logic.
  * Minimize errors related to mutable operations on immutable data.
  * Grow the user base and community around the Immer library.

* Most important business risks:
  * Security vulnerabilities in the library could impact applications that depend on it.
  * Performance issues could deter adoption or cause problems in production applications.
  * Bugs or instability could lead to developer frustration and decreased adoption.
  * Lack of community support or maintenance could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The Immer project is an open-source JavaScript library. As such, its security posture relies heavily on community review, secure development practices, and the broader JavaScript ecosystem security.

* Security controls:
  * security control: Open Source Code: The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  * security control: Unit Tests: The project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the code and prevent regressions. (Implemented: Test suite in the repository)
  * security control: Linting: Code linting is likely used to enforce code style and catch potential errors. (Likely Implemented: Configuration files in the repository, CI pipeline)
  * security control: GitHub Security Features: GitHub provides features like Dependabot for dependency vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub platform features)

* Accepted risks:
  * accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: As a JavaScript library, Immer depends on other packages, which may have vulnerabilities.
  * accepted risk: Open Source Security Model: Reliance on community contributions and reviews for security.
  * accepted risk: Supply Chain Risks: Risks associated with the npm registry and the build/publish process.

* Recommended security controls:
  * security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  * security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Regularly perform SCA to identify known vulnerabilities in the library's codebase and dependencies.
  * security control: Security Audits: For critical releases or to increase confidence, consider periodic security audits by external security experts.
  * security control: Secure Development Practices Documentation: Document secure coding practices followed in the project.

* Security requirements:
  * Authentication: Not applicable. Immer is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication.
  * Authorization: Not applicable. Immer does not manage access control or authorization.
  * Input Validation: Important for the Immer API to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to malformed input. Input validation should be implemented within the library's core functions to ensure robustness.
  * Cryptography: Not directly applicable. Immer does not handle sensitive data or cryptographic operations. However, if future features involve data handling, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical business process:
  * Development of JavaScript applications that rely on efficient and reliable immutable state management.
  * Distribution of the Immer library to the JavaScript developer community.

* Data we are trying to protect:
  * Source code of the Immer library (intellectual property, prevent tampering).
  * Integrity of the Immer package published to npm (prevent supply chain attacks).
  * Indirectly, the security and stability of applications that depend on Immer.

* Data sensitivity:
  * Immer source code: Publicly available, but integrity is important.
  * Immer npm package: Publicly available, integrity is critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
  * Data handled by applications using Immer: Sensitivity depends on the application itself, Immer itself does not handle sensitive application data directly.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
  * Are there any specific security incidents or concerns related to Immer or similar libraries that are driving this threat modeling exercise?
  * What is the risk appetite of the organization using Immer? Is it a startup or a large enterprise? (Assuming a general assessment for a broad audience).
  * Are there any specific compliance requirements that need to be considered for libraries used in projects?

* Assumptions:
  * The primary concern is the security of applications that *use* Immer, and ensuring Immer itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.
  * The target audience for this document is developers and security professionals interested in understanding the security aspects of using Immer.
  * Immer is intended for use in client-side JavaScript applications and does not directly handle server-side or backend security concerns.
  * The focus is on the open-source nature of Immer and the associated security considerations.
