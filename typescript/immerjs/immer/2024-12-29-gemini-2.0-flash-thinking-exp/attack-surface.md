### High and Critical Immer-Specific Attack Surfaces

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Weaknesses in Producer Functions Amplified by Immer
    *   **Description:** While the logic within producer functions is the developer's responsibility, Immer's draft mechanism can amplify the impact of vulnerabilities within these functions.
    *   **How Immer Contributes:** Immer provides a mutable draft, making it easier for developers to write complex update logic. However, if this logic contains vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input handling), the draft's mutability can make exploitation more direct.
    *   **Example:** A producer function might use user-provided data to index into an array within the draft without proper bounds checking. An attacker could provide an out-of-bounds index, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, or potential for further exploitation depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the producer function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat producer functions as critical security components and apply secure coding practices.
        *   Thoroughly test producer functions with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within producer functions.
        *   Consider using type checking and static analysis tools to identify potential issues in producer logic.
