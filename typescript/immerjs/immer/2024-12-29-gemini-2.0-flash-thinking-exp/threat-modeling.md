### High and Critical Immer.js Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Immer.js library:

*   **Threat:** Draft Object Exposure leading to Malicious Modification
    *   **Description:** An attacker, through a separate vulnerability (e.g., XSS), gains access to the mutable Immer draft object before Immer finalizes the state. The attacker then directly manipulates this draft object to inject malicious data or alter the intended state changes. This directly exploits the mutable nature of the Immer draft before it's finalized.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application logic bypass, potential for privilege escalation if the manipulated state controls access or permissions, introduction of vulnerabilities that can be further exploited.
    *   **Affected Immer Component:** The `draft` object provided within the `produce` function's callback.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prioritize preventing client-side vulnerabilities like XSS that could grant access to in-memory objects.
        *   Minimize the scope and lifetime of draft objects. Avoid storing or passing them outside the immediate `produce` callback if possible.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious data that could be used to target the draft object.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Excessive Immer Operations
    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers actions that cause a large number of complex Immer `produce` calls or mutations on very large state trees. This directly overloads Immer's processing capabilities, consuming excessive server or client-side resources, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, temporary unavailability, increased resource consumption and costs, potential for complete denial of service.
    *   **Affected Immer Component:** The `produce` function and the underlying mechanisms for creating and managing drafts and new states.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on actions that trigger Immer operations.
        *   Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent the creation of excessively large or complex state updates that burden Immer.
        *   Monitor resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks related to Immer operations.
        *   Optimize state structure to avoid unnecessary deep nesting or overly large objects that increase Immer's processing time.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Immer Library Itself
    *   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the Immer library code itself. An attacker could directly exploit this vulnerability through various means, depending on the nature of the flaw within Immer's implementation.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service due to a bug in Immer's processing to potentially more severe issues if a flaw allows for unintended state manipulation or other security breaches within the library's scope.
    *   **Affected Immer Component:** Any part of the Immer library's codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Immer library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches released by the maintainers.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues specifically related to Immer.
        *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies like Immer.
