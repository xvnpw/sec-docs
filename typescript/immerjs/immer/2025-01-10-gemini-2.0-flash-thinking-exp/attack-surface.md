# Attack Surface Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Immer's Internal Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_immer's_internal_implementation.md)

* **Description:** Like any software, Immer itself could contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its internal code.
* **How Immer Contributes:** As a dependency, any vulnerability in Immer's core logic directly impacts applications using it.
* **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability within Immer's proxy handling mechanism could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
* **Impact:**  Can range from application crashes and data corruption to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be **Critical**, High, or Medium). *Including here as it can be Critical.*
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Immer updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues in Immer.
    * Consider using static analysis tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
