## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Immer's Internal Mechanisms (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_immer's_internal_mechanisms__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Bypass Proxy Logic (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE):**
*   Description: Find ways to directly modify the original state without triggering Immer's change detection.
*   Actionable Insight: Thoroughly review Immer's proxy implementation for potential bypass scenarios. Ensure Immer is updated to the latest version with known bug fixes.
*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: High
*   Skill Level: Expert
*   Detection Difficulty: Very High

**Interfere with Proxy Traps (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE):**
*   Description: Manipulate the behavior of Immer's proxy traps (get, set, deleteProperty, etc.) to cause unintended side effects or prevent change tracking.
*   Actionable Insight: Understand the limitations and potential edge cases of Immer's proxy trap implementation. Avoid relying on assumptions about proxy behavior in security-sensitive logic.
*   Likelihood: Very Low
*   Impact: Critical
*   Effort: Very High
*   Skill Level: Expert
*   Detection Difficulty: Extremely High

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application's Immer Usage (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application's_immer_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

**Retain Draft References (HIGH RISK):**
*   Description: Application code unintentionally retains a reference to a draft object after the producer function has finished, allowing for direct mutation of the finalized state.
*   Actionable Insight: Implement code reviews and static analysis to identify potential instances of retaining draft references. Educate developers on the importance of not holding onto drafts.
*   Likelihood: Medium to High
*   Impact: Medium to High
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium

**Share Drafts Improperly (HIGH RISK):**
*   Description: Application code shares a draft object between different parts of the application, leading to unexpected side effects and race conditions when multiple parts attempt to modify the same draft.
*   Actionable Insight: Enforce strict rules against sharing draft objects. Emphasize the immutability of the final state and the intended single-use nature of drafts within a producer function.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: Medium to High
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Immer.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_immer_js__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of an attacker targeting vulnerabilities introduced by Immer. Successful exploitation along any of the high-risk paths will lead to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Immer's Internal Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_immer's_internal_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation here directly undermines the core security principles of Immer, allowing attackers to bypass its intended behavior and directly manipulate the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Proxy Logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_proxy_logic__critical_node_.md)

This specific attack vector is critical because it allows attackers to circumvent Immer's change tracking mechanism entirely, enabling direct and undetected modification of the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Interfere with Proxy Traps (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/interfere_with_proxy_traps__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector is critical as it involves manipulating the fundamental building blocks of Immer's change detection. Successful interference can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous state modifications.
