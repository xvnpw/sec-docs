# Threat Model Analysis for immerjs/immer

## Threat: [Excessive Draft Creation Leading to Memory Exhaustion](./threats/excessive_draft_creation_leading_to_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions within the application that cause the creation of a large number of nested or unnecessary Immer draft objects. This could be achieved by manipulating input parameters or exploiting application logic flaws that feed into state updates managed by Immer. The attacker aims to consume excessive memory through Immer's draft creation mechanism, leading to application slowdowns or crashes.
*   **Impact:** Application performance degradation, potential denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion on the client or server.
*   **Affected Immer Component:** `produce` function, internal proxy mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent the creation of excessively complex state structures that lead to numerous drafts.
    *   Review application logic to identify and optimize areas where state updates within `produce` could lead to excessive draft creation.
    *   Implement timeouts or resource limits on operations that could potentially trigger uncontrolled draft creation.
    *   Monitor application memory usage to detect anomalies related to Immer's memory consumption.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Patches in Applications Using `produceWithPatches` and `applyPatches`](./threats/manipulation_of_patches_in_applications_using__producewithpatches__and__applypatches_.md)

*   **Description:** If an application uses `produceWithPatches` and `applyPatches` to transmit or store state changes, an attacker might intercept and manipulate these patch objects. By altering the patches generated by Immer, they could introduce unintended and potentially malicious changes to the application's state when the patches are applied using Immer's `applyPatches`.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential for injecting malicious data or logic into the application's state.
*   **Affected Immer Component:** `produceWithPatches` function, `applyPatches` function, patch objects.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure secure transmission of patch data (e.g., using HTTPS) to prevent interception.
    *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of received patch data before applying it using `applyPatches`.
    *   Consider using cryptographic signatures or other integrity checks to verify the authenticity and integrity of patches before application.
    *   Limit the exposure of patch generation and application logic to trusted environments.
