### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Ant Design Pro

Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical security risks that directly involve the Ant Design Pro framework.

*   **Threat:** Component-Level Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application through vulnerabilities in specific Ant Design Pro components if they are not used correctly or if a vulnerability exists within the component itself. This could involve submitting crafted data through forms rendered by `<ProForm>` or manipulating data displayed in `<ProTable>` components.
    *   **Impact:** Successful XSS attacks can allow the attacker to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Form components (`<ProForm>`) and their individual input fields provided by Ant Design.
        *   Table components (`<ProTable>`) when rendering custom columns or data using renderers.
        *   Potentially other components that render user-provided or dynamically generated content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user inputs before rendering them within Ant Design components.
        *   Utilize Ant Design's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS where available in component configurations.
        *   Be extremely cautious when using features that allow rendering of raw HTML within Ant Design Pro components.
        *   Regularly review and test custom components or customizations made to Ant Design Pro components for XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Vulnerabilities within Ant Design Pro
    *   **Description:** Insecure default configurations or misconfigurations specific to Ant Design Pro's features or how it utilizes underlying Ant Design components could expose vulnerabilities. This might involve leaving development-specific features enabled in production or misconfiguring security-related settings within Ant Design components used by Ant Design Pro.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information, bypass security measures, or cause unexpected application behavior due to misconfigurations within the framework's setup or usage of its underlying components.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Configuration files or settings related to Ant Design Pro's layout, theming, or other features.
        *   Potentially the configuration of specific Ant Design components used within Ant Design Pro layouts and views.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific misconfiguration).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden default configurations provided by Ant Design Pro.
        *   Ensure that any development-specific features or debugging options are disabled in production environments.
        *   Carefully configure security-related settings of Ant Design components used within the application.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls within the application's features built using Ant Design Pro.

*   **Threat:** Outdated Ant Design Pro Version with Known Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated version of Ant Design Pro that contains known security vulnerabilities makes the application susceptible to exploits targeting those specific flaws within the framework's code.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage publicly known vulnerabilities present in the older version of Ant Design Pro to compromise the application, potentially leading to XSS, data breaches, or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core Ant Design Pro library files and components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Ant Design Pro updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Regularly check the official Ant Design Pro release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for promptly updating the framework when security patches are released.
