### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Malicious File Path (Linux)

* Description:
    1. The VS Code extension "Open in Browser" uses the `opn` library to open files in a browser.
    2. On Linux systems, `opn` utilizes the `xdg-open` command.
    3. The `xdg-open` command is known to be vulnerable to command injection if the file path argument is not properly sanitized.
    4. If a user opens a file with a maliciously crafted name containing shell command injection characters (e.g., backticks, dollar signs, etc.), this could lead to arbitrary command execution on the user's system when the extension attempts to open the file in a browser.
    5. An attacker could trick a user into opening a file with a malicious name, thereby exploiting this vulnerability when the user uses the "Open in Browser" extension.

* Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's system. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's machine, steal sensitive data, or install malware.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The code directly passes the file path to the `opn` library without any sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    The `path` parameter should be sanitized before being passed to the `opn` function, especially on Linux systems. This could involve escaping shell-sensitive characters in the file path to prevent command injection.

* Preconditions:
    * The user must be using a Linux operating system where `xdg-open` is used by the `opn` library.
    * The user must open a file that has a malicious name containing shell command injection characters.
    * The user must trigger the "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Specified Browser" command for the malicious file.

* Source code analysis:
    1. In `/code/src/extension.ts`, the `activate` function registers two commands: `extension.openInDefaultBrowser` and `extension.openInSpecifyBrowser`.
    2. These commands are handled by `openDefault` and `openBySpecify` functions in `/code/src/index.ts`.
    3. Both `openDefault` and `openBySpecify` functions retrieve the file path (`uri.fsPath`) of the currently active text editor or from the argument passed to the command.
    4. In `/code/src/util.ts`, the `open` function is defined as:
    ```typescript
    export const open = (path: string, browser: string = '') => {
      opn(path, { app: browser })
        .catch(_ => {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Open browser failed!! Please check if you have installed the browser ${browser} correctly!`);
        });
    };
    ```
    5. This function directly passes the `path` variable to the `opn` library without any sanitization.
    6. On Linux, `opn` uses `xdg-open` which is vulnerable to command injection via filename.

* Security test case:
    1. **Preparation:** Ensure you are on a Linux system. Create a new file with the following malicious name: `testfile\`touch /tmp/pwned\`.html` (or similar command injection payload).
    2. **Step 1:** Open VS Code and open the newly created file `testfile\`touch /tmp/pwned\`.html`.
    3. **Step 2:** Use the shortcut `Alt + B` (or right-click in the editor and select "Open in Default Browser") to trigger the "Open in Default Browser" command.
    4. **Step 3:** Check if the command injection was successful. In this case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created. You can use the command `ls /tmp/pwned` in the terminal.
    5. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created, indicating that the `touch /tmp/pwned` command was executed due to command injection through the malicious file name.
