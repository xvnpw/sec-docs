## Vulnerability List

After reviewing the project and applying the specified filters for external attacker scenarios targeting a VSCode extension, no vulnerabilities with a rank of 'high' or above have been identified that meet the inclusion criteria and are not excluded by the given conditions.

Specifically:

- The analysis focused on potential vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.
- Vulnerabilities arising from insecure coding practices within project files by developers are excluded as per instructions.
- Vulnerabilities that are solely due to missing documentation are excluded.
- Denial of Service vulnerabilities are also excluded from this list.

The remaining analysis considered vulnerabilities that are valid, not already mitigated, and ranked 'high' or above. Based on this refined analysis, no such vulnerabilities were found in the project.

Therefore, the updated vulnerability list remains empty for vulnerabilities ranked 'high' or above that meet the specified criteria.
