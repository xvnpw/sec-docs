## Combined Vulnerability List

This list details a command injection vulnerability found in the VS Code extension "Open in Browser". Duplicate entries from the provided lists have been removed, and the information has been combined for clarity and completeness.

### Vulnerability: Command Injection via Malicious File Path

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a workspace and includes a file with a malicious filename. This filename is designed to contain shell command injection sequences, using characters such as backticks (`), dollar signs ($), parentheses (), semicolons (;), and others that are interpreted by the shell.
    2. A user opens this attacker-crafted workspace in VS Code.
    3. The user navigates to and opens the malicious file within the VS Code editor, making it the currently active text editor.
    4. The user then triggers the "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Specified Browser" command provided by the extension. This can be done via the context menu, command palette, or a keyboard shortcut (like `Alt + B` for default browser or `Shift + Alt + B` for specified browser).
    5. The extension, upon receiving the command, retrieves the file path of the active text editor. Critically, this path includes the malicious filename created by the attacker.
    6. The extension utilizes the `opn` library to open this retrieved file path in a web browser.
    7. The `opn` library, depending on the user's operating system, executes a system command to open the file. On Linux, this command is often `xdg-open`. On macOS, it's typically `open`, and on Windows, it's `start`.
    8. Due to the lack of proper sanitization of the file path within the extension before it's passed to `opn`, the operating system's shell interprets the malicious command injection sequences embedded within the filename. As a result, the shell executes these injected commands in addition to the intended action of opening the file in the browser.

* **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary command execution on the user's machine. The commands are executed with the same privileges as the VS Code process. This high-severity impact allows an attacker to:
    - **Gain full control of the user's machine:** Execute commands to create new user accounts, modify system settings, or install persistent backdoors.
    - **Steal sensitive data:** Access and exfiltrate sensitive files, environment variables, credentials, or API keys stored on the user's system.
    - **Install malware:** Download and execute malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - **System compromise:**  Modify critical system files, potentially leading to data corruption or system instability.
    - **Indirect Denial of Service:** While direct DoS is excluded from the initial scope, command injection could be leveraged to execute resource-intensive commands, degrading system performance and indirectly causing a denial of service.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** high

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None. A review of the extension's source code reveals that the file path, obtained directly from VS Code's API, is passed to the `opn` library without any sanitization or validation. This direct and unsanitized path handling leaves the application vulnerable to command injection.

* **Missing mitigations:**
    To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the following mitigations are crucial:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of the file path before it is passed to the `opn` library. This should involve:
        - **Escaping shell-sensitive characters:**  Identify and escape or remove all characters that have special meaning in shell commands, such as backticks (`), dollar signs ($), parentheses (), semicolons (;), ampersands (&), pipes (|), angle brackets (<, >), etc.
        - **Path validation:** Validate the file path to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain command injection patterns. Consider using allowlists for characters or path structures, rather than blocklists which can be bypassed.
    - **Alternative API Exploration:** Investigate if there are safer, cross-platform APIs for opening files in browsers that do not rely on shell command execution. Explore APIs that directly interact with the operating system's browser handling mechanisms without invoking a shell, which would inherently avoid command injection risks.

* **Preconditions:**
    To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the following conditions must be met:
    1. **Linux Operating System (for `xdg-open` specific vulnerability):** While the vulnerability is present across operating systems, the initial report highlighted Linux systems due to the `opn` library's use of `xdg-open`. The user needs to be on a system where `opn` might utilize shell commands susceptible to injection (Linux, and potentially macOS in certain configurations). Windows is also vulnerable via the `start` command.
    2. **Malicious Workspace and Filename:** The attacker must be able to deliver or trick the user into opening a VS Code workspace that contains a file with a maliciously crafted filename. This could be achieved through social engineering, malicious repositories, or supply chain attacks.
    3. **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious file within VS Code, making it the active editor, and subsequently trigger either the "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Specified Browser" command.

* **Source code analysis:**
    1. **`src/extension.ts`**: The `activate` function in `extension.ts` registers the commands `extension.openInDefaultBrowser` and `extension.openInSpecifyBrowser`, linking them to the `openDefault` and `openBySpecify` functions in `index.ts`.
    2. **`src/index.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        export const openDefault = (path: any): void => {
          let uri;
          if (path) {
            uri = path.fsPath; // [ vulnerable code ] Path from argument (context menu)
          } else {
            const _path = currentPageUri();
            uri = _path && _path.fsPath; // [ vulnerable code ] Path from current file
          }
          const browser = standardizedBrowserName(defaultBrowser());
          open(uri, browser); // Calls util.open with potentially unsafe path
        };

        export const openBySpecify = (path: any): void => {
          // ... similar path retrieval ...
          open(uri, item.standardName); // Calls util.open with potentially unsafe path
        };
        ```
        - The functions `openDefault` and `openBySpecify` retrieve the file path using `uri.fsPath`. This path is obtained either from the argument passed to the command (e.g., from context menu) or from the currently active text editor (`currentPageUri()`).  Crucially, no sanitization is performed on this `uri.fsPath` in `index.ts`.

    3. **`src/util.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        const opn = require('opn');

        export const open = (path: string, browser: string = '') => {
          opn(path, { app: browser }) // [ vulnerable code ] Calls opn directly with unsanitized path
            .catch(_ => {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Open browser failed!! Please check if you have installed the browser ${browser} correctly!`);
            });
        };
        ```
        - The `open` function in `util.ts` is the core of the vulnerability. It directly invokes the `opn` library, passing the unsanitized `path` argument. The `opn` library then handles opening the path in the browser, potentially using shell commands like `xdg-open` on Linux, `open` on macOS, or `start` on Windows.  This direct invocation without sanitization is the point where command injection becomes possible.

    ```

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure you are using an operating system where `opn` might use shell commands vulnerable to injection (Linux, macOS, or Windows). For Linux, the test case will specifically target `xdg-open`.
    2. **Malicious File Creation:**
        - Create a new directory, for example, `vscode-open-browser-test`.
        - Inside this directory, create a file with a malicious name designed for command injection.
            - **Linux Example:** `test_$(touch /tmp/pwned).html` - This filename attempts to execute `touch /tmp/pwned` when interpreted by the shell.
            - **Windows Example:** `test_%2528echo pwned>%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\pwned.txt%2529.html` - This example attempts to create a file `pwned.txt` on the Desktop. (Note: Windows command injection syntax can be more complex and may require adjustments based on the shell and encoding).
    3. **Open Workspace in VS Code:** Open VS Code and open the `vscode-open-browser-test` directory as a workspace.
    4. **Open Malicious File:** Open the newly created malicious file (e.g., `test_$(touch /tmp/pwned).html`) in the VS Code editor, making it the active editor.
    5. **Trigger "Open in Default Browser":** Execute the "Open in Default Browser" command. This can be done using the default shortcut `Alt + B`, right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Open in Default Browser", or via the command palette.
    6. **Verify Command Execution (Default Browser):**
        - **Linux:** Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created. Use the command `ls /tmp/pwned` in the terminal. If the file exists, command injection was successful.
        - **Windows:** Check if the file `pwned.txt` has been created on your Desktop.
    7. **Trigger "Open in Specified Browser":** Repeat steps 4 and 5, but this time, execute the "Open in Specified Browser" command (using `Shift + Alt + B` or the command palette). Select any browser from the list.
    8. **Verify Command Execution (Specified Browser):**
        - **Linux:** Again, check for the creation of `/tmp/pwned` using `ls /tmp/pwned`.
        - **Windows:** Check for the creation of `pwned.txt` on your Desktop.
    9. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability is present, triggering either "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Specified Browser" with the malicious file open will result in the execution of the injected command. This is evidenced by the creation of the test files (`/tmp/pwned` on Linux or `pwned.txt` on Windows), confirming arbitrary command execution.

This security test case clearly demonstrates how an attacker can leverage malicious filenames and the "Open in Browser" extension to achieve command injection, highlighting the severity and exploitability of this vulnerability.
