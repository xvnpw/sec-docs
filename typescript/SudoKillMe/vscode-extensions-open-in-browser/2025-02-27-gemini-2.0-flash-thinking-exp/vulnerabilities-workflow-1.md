### Combined Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Unvalidated File Path**
  - **Description:**
    The extension’s core commands (registered as “extension.openInDefaultBrowser” and “extension.openInSpecifyBrowser”) obtain a file path from either the command argument or the active editor. They then extract the “fsPath” property and pass it directly to the third‑party library (opn) without any validation or sanitization. An external attacker who can influence the “path” argument might supply a crafted object (for example, one whose “fsPath” value embeds shell metacharacters or additional command fragments) so that when opn builds and executes the external process command, it runs the injected payload.
    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. The attacker arranges for the extension command to be invoked with a malicious object (e.g. `{ fsPath: "C:\\malicious\\file && echo hacked > C:\\temp\\poc.txt" }`) instead of a normal file URI.
    2. The registered command (in files such as “src/index.ts” or “out/index.js”) checks for a “path” argument and sets `uri = path.fsPath` without sanitization.
    3. This unsanitized URI is passed to the helper function (in “src/util.ts”/“out/util.js”) which calls `opn(uri, { app: browser })`.
    4. If the underlying opn routine processes the string in a context that permits shell command interpretation, the malicious payload is executed.
  - **Impact:**
    If successfully exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s system, leading to full system compromise, data theft, or further lateral movement.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None—there is no validation or sanitization of the “fsPath” input before it is passed to opn.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and strictly type‑check the “path” argument ensuring it is a well‑formed file URI.
    - Whitelist allowed path patterns (for example, ensuring the string conforms to expected directory structures) before passing it to an external process.
    - Use child‑process execution methods that do not allow shell interpolation, thereby avoiding inadvertent command concatenation.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able either to influence how the extension command is invoked (for example, through a compromised invocation via the VS Code command API or via a malicious workspace configuration) or supply a custom “path” object with a crafted “fsPath” value.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In “src/index.ts” (and similarly in “out/index.js”), the function `openDefault` determines the file path as follows:
      ```ts
      let uri;
      if (path) {
        uri = path.fsPath;
      } else {
        const _path = currentPageUri();
        uri = _path && _path.fsPath;
      }
      ```
      The resulting “uri” is then passed to the helper function in “src/util.ts”:
      ```ts
      opn(uri, { app: browser })
          .catch(_ => { … });
      ```
      There is no sanitization of `uri` before it is provided to opn, opening a potential avenue for injection.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled VS Code testing environment, craft a malicious object such as:
       ```js
       const maliciousPath = { fsPath: "C:\\malicious\\file && echo hacked > C:\\temp\\poc.txt" };
       ```
    2. Invoke the command “extension.openInDefaultBrowser” by using VS Code’s command API (or via the Developer Tools console), passing the malicious object as the argument.
    3. Monitor the system (for example, check whether the file “C:\temp\poc.txt” is created with the expected output or observe any unintended external commands being executed).
    4. Confirm that without proper sanitization the injected payload is processed, thereby validating the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Execution via Unrestricted File Opening**
  - **Description:**
    The extension is designed with the explicit feature (as documented in the README) to “open *any* type of file with the default program.” There is no filtering or validation to restrict the types of files that may be launched. An attacker with influence over the project files (for example, via a malicious pull request or by compromising a repository that is loaded as a workspace) can include a malicious file (such as an executable script or binary). When a user inadvertently triggers the “open in default browser” command on that file, the file will be launched by the operating system using its associated (and potentially dangerous) program.
    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. The attacker inserts or commits a malicious file into the repository (knowing that the extension makes no file‑type checks).
    2. The user, trusting the workspace, opens the file in VS Code.
    3. When the user activates “extension.openInDefaultBrowser” (or uses the right‑click command), the extension simply retrieves the file’s path via `fsPath` and passes it to opn.
    4. The system then launches the file using its default application association—even if that file is an executable or script containing harmful logic.
  - **Impact:**
    This could result in the execution of malicious code if the associated default application runs the file without prompting the user, thus leading to arbitrary code execution and potential full system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There are no file‑type validations or safety prompts implemented. The behavior is as designed per the README, but it leaves a dangerous “open‑any‑file” attack surface.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed file extensions (such as HTML or text files) that are safe to display in a browser.
    - For file types that could lead to execution (e.g. executables, scripts), add a confirmation prompt before opening the file.
    - Alternatively, ensure that any file opened in a “browser” context is subject to content type verification.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to insert a malicious file into the workspace (for example, via a malicious commit or repository compromise).
    - The user must then trigger the open command on that file.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In both “src/index.ts” and “out/index.js” the extension retrieves the file path by:
      ```ts
      if (path) {
        uri = path.fsPath;
      } else {
        const _path = currentPageUri();
        uri = _path && _path.fsPath;
      }
      ```
      No further inspection is done on the actual file type or its safety before calling:
      ```ts
      opn(uri, { app: browser })
      ```
    - As such, any file—even those that are executable or otherwise dangerous—is opened without scrutiny.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test workspace, add a file with a potentially dangerous extension (for example, a script file or a simple benign executable with a harmless payload that logs an event).
    2. Open the file in VS Code and then trigger the “open in default browser” command on that file.
    3. Observe that the file is launched immediately with its default associated handler.
    4. Verify that adding file‑type filtering (or a confirmation prompt) prevents or warns about opening files that could execute code.

- **Vulnerability Name: Dependency on Deprecated and Potentially Vulnerable “opn” Library**
  - **Description:**
    The extension directly imports and uses the “opn” library (in both “src/util.ts” and “out/util.js”) to launch external applications. “opn” has been deprecated in favor of the more actively maintained “open” library. Relying on a deprecated dependency can be risky if vulnerabilities are later discovered in it—especially given that the extension passes user‑influenced inputs (such as file paths and application names) directly into opn’s API.
    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An attacker studies the dependency tree and identifies that “opn” is used for launching external processes.
    2. If vulnerabilities (for example, related to command injection or unsafe child‑process handling) are found in opn, an attacker might craft inputs—as in the first vulnerability—to exploit those issues.
    3. The exploitation would occur when the extension calls opn with unsanitized inputs.
  - **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution or other forms of system compromise via vulnerabilities in the opn library.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations exist in the extension regarding the choice of external library; the opn module is used as is.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Replace the deprecated “opn” dependency with a maintained and secure alternative (such as “open”).
    - Regularly audit third‑party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Implement input sanitization before passing user‑influenced parameters to any external library.
  - **Preconditions:**
    An attacker must be able to trigger the extension’s open commands and supply inputs that interact with the opn’s vulnerable code paths.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Both “src/util.ts” and “out/util.js” contain the lines:
      ```js
      const opn = require('opn');
      …
      opn(path, { app: browser })
          .catch(_ => { … });
      ```
    - No additional safeguards or sanitization logic is applied before these calls, meaning that any weakness in opn is directly exposed through the extension.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Identify the version of the opn library in use and search for any documented vulnerabilities against that version.
    2. In a controlled test, simulate supplying malicious input (as described in the test case for arbitrary command execution) to verify whether opn handles it safely or replicates the vulnerability.
    3. Replace opn with the “open” library and rerun the test to confirm that the updated dependency neutralizes the threat.
    4. Verify that dependency auditing tools report no high‑risk vulnerabilities after the replacement.
