### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Unexpected Code Reformatting via Malicious Configuration

*   **Description:**
    An attacker can create a project containing a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` configuration file with unexpected or disruptive formatting settings. When a victim opens this project in VS Code with the "Beautify" extension installed and uses the beautifier (either manually or on save), the extension will apply the malicious formatting settings from the `.jsbeautifyrc` file. This can lead to significant and unexpected changes in the victim's code, potentially introducing subtle bugs, hindering code readability, and disrupting the development process.

    **Steps to trigger:**
    1.  Attacker creates a new project or modifies an existing one.
    2.  Attacker places a `.jsbeautifyrc` file in the root directory of the project (or any directory in the path tree of the files to be beautified).
    3.  Attacker crafts the `.jsbeautifyrc` file with malicious or disruptive formatting configurations. For example, setting extreme indentation, unusual line breaks, or disabling newline at the end of file. An example of malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` content:
        ```json
        {
            "indent_size": 10,
            "indent_char": " ",
            "end_with_newline": false,
            "preserve_newlines": false
        }
        ```
    4.  Attacker tricks a victim into opening this project in VS Code with the "Beautify" extension installed. This could be done by sharing the project repository or any other means of project distribution.
    5.  Victim opens a code file (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS) within the project in VS Code.
    6.  Victim triggers the beautification command, either manually (e.g., using "Beautify File" command or shortcut) or automatically (if "editor.formatOnSave" is enabled).
    7.  The "Beautify" extension reads the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file and applies the defined formatting rules to the victim's code.
    8.  The victim's code is now unexpectedly and potentially disruptively reformatted according to the attacker's malicious configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Integrity**: Unexpected and unwanted code reformatting can make the code harder to read and understand, potentially leading to subtle bugs being introduced or overlooked.
    *   **Development Disruption**:  Developers may waste time trying to understand and revert the unexpected formatting changes. Code reviews become more difficult due to large, formatting-related diffs.
    *   **Loss of Productivity**: The unexpected changes and the effort to fix them can significantly reduce developer productivity.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   **Configuration File Search Order**: The extension searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` files in the file's path tree, up to the project root, and also in the home directory. This is documented in the `README.md`. However, it does not prevent malicious files from being loaded if they are placed in the project structure.
    *   **User Awareness (Implicit)**: Users who are familiar with VS Code extensions and configuration files might be aware that extensions can read configuration files from the project. However, this is not an explicit mitigation provided by the extension itself.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Warning on Configuration File Detection**: The extension should display a warning message when a `.jsbeautifyrc` file is detected within the workspace, especially if it significantly overrides user or workspace settings. This warning could inform the user about the configuration file and prompt them to review its content.
    *   **Configuration File Validation**: The extension could implement validation for `.jsbeautifyrc` files to detect potentially harmful settings or setting combinations. This could be complex, as "harmful" formatting is subjective. However, detecting extremely large indentation sizes or disabling essential formatting rules might be possible.
    *   **Option to Ignore Project `.jsbeautifyrc` Files**: Provide a setting to allow users to ignore `.jsbeautifyrc` files found in the project and only rely on user or workspace settings. This would give users more control over the formatting process, especially when working with untrusted projects.
    *   **Secure Defaults and Limits**: While not directly preventing the vulnerability, having more secure default formatting settings and enforcing limits on certain parameters (e.g., maximum indentation size) could reduce the potential impact of malicious configurations.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Victim has VS Code installed.
    *   Victim has the "Beautify" extension installed.
    *   Victim opens a project containing a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in VS Code.
    *   Victim uses the beautifier command on a code file within the project.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **`options.js` - Configuration Loading:**
        The `options.js` file is responsible for loading beautifier options. The `module.exports` function in `options.js` is the entry point for retrieving options.

        ```javascript
        module.exports = (doc, type, formattingOptions) => {
          // ...
          let dir = doc.isUntitled ? root : path.dirname(doc.fileName);
          let configFile = dir ? findRecursive(dir, '.jsbeautifyrc', root) : null;
          // ...
          if (!configFile) {
            let beautify_config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('beautify')
              .config;
            // ...
          }
          if (!configFile && root) {
            configFile = findRecursive(path.dirname(root), '.jsbeautifyrc');
          }
          if (!configFile) {
            configFile = path.join(os.homedir(), '.jsbeautifyrc');
            if (!fs.existsSync(configFile)) return Promise.resolve(opts);
          }
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            fs.readFile(configFile, 'utf8', (e, d) => { // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Reading .jsbeautifyrc file
              // ...
              try {
                const unCommented = dropComments(d.toString());
                opts = JSON.parse(unCommented); // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Parsing .jsbeautifyrc content
                opts = mergeOpts(opts, type);
                resolve(opts);
              } catch (e) {
                // ...
              }
            });
          });
        };
        ```
        - The code uses `findRecursive` to search for `.jsbeautifyrc` starting from the directory of the opened document and going up to the workspace root.
        - If no project-level `.jsbeautifyrc` is found, it checks for a `beautify.config` setting in VS Code settings and then a `.jsbeautifyrc` in the home directory.
        - The vulnerability lies in the fact that if a `.jsbeautifyrc` file is found (especially in the project directory, controlled by the attacker), its content is read using `fs.readFile` and parsed using `JSON.parse`. There is no validation or sanitization of the configuration content before it's used by the beautifier.

    2.  **`extension.js` - Applying Options:**
        The `extension.js` file uses the options loaded by `options.js` to beautify the code.

        ```javascript
        const beautifyDocRanges = (doc, ranges, type, formattingOptions, isPartial) => {
          // ...
          return Promise.resolve(type ? type : getBeautifyType())
            .then(type => options(doc, type, formattingOptions) // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Loading options, potentially from malicious .jsbeautifyrc
              .then(config => removeNewLineEndForPartial(config, isPartial))
              .then(config => Promise.all(ranges.map(range =>
                beautify[type](doc.getText(range), config))))); // Applying beautifier with loaded config
        };
        ```
        - The `beautifyDocRanges` function calls `options(doc, type, formattingOptions)` to get the beautification configuration.
        - This configuration, potentially loaded from a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc`, is then directly passed to the `beautify[type]` function along with the code to be beautified.
        - The `js-beautify` library will then use these configuration options to reformat the code.

    Victim Opens Project in VS Code                                                                Code Reformatting with Malicious Config
    Victim Beautifies Code                                                                         (Unexpected and Disruptive Changes)
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    **Pre-requisites:**
    *   VS Code with "Beautify" extension installed.
    *   A test project directory.

    **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new directory named `test-project`.
    2.  Inside `test-project`, create a file named `.jsbeautifyrc` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "indent_size": 10,
            "indent_char": " ",
            "end_with_newline": false,
            "preserve_newlines": false
        }
        ```
    3.  Inside `test-project`, create a JavaScript file named `test.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        function testFunction() {
          var a = 1;
        }
        ```
    4.  Open VS Code and open the `test-project` directory as a workspace.
    5.  Open the `test.js` file in VS Code editor.
    6.  Execute the "Beautify File" command (e.g., by pressing `F1` and typing "Beautify File", or using a keyboard shortcut if configured).
    7.  **Observe the changes in `test.js`**.

    **Expected Result:**
    The `test.js` file should be reformatted according to the settings in `.jsbeautifyrc`. Specifically, you should observe:
    *   Indentation of 10 spaces.
    *   No newline character at the end of the file.
    *   Potentially other formatting changes depending on the default settings and the malicious configuration.

    **Verification:**
    After running the test case, the content of `test.js` should look like this (or similar, depending on platform line endings):
    ```javascript
    function testFunction() {
               var a = 1;
    }```
    This demonstrates that the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file has successfully overridden the default formatting settings and caused unexpected reformatting of the code.

This test case confirms that a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file can indeed influence the formatting behavior of the "Beautify" extension and cause unexpected code changes.
