### Vulnerabilities in js-beautify for VS Code

#### 1. Uncontrolled Configuration Lookup Scope Leading to Project-Wide or Global Configuration Injection and Symlink Attack

**Description:**
The js-beautify extension searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` configuration files in the directory of the file being beautified and recursively up through its parent directories. This search extends beyond the current VSCode workspace, potentially reaching the user's home directory or even the system root.  Furthermore, the extension does not validate if a found `.jsbeautifyrc` file is a regular file or a symbolic link. This combination of uncontrolled scope and lack of symlink validation allows for several attack scenarios. An attacker who can place a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a parent directory of a user's workspace (e.g., in the user's home directory), or create a symlink named `.jsbeautifyrc` within a project pointing to an external malicious configuration, could have this configuration loaded and applied to the user's projects opened within that workspace, without the user's explicit knowledge or consent. This can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful code formatting across different projects, as the malicious configuration would override project-specific or default settings.

**Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
1. **Scenario 1 (Parent Directory Configuration Injection):**
    1. Attacker creates a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file (e.g., setting extreme indentation or other disruptive formatting rules) and places it in a common parent directory of potential victim workspaces, such as the user's home directory (`~/.jsbeautifyrc`).
    2. Victim user opens a VSCode workspace or a file within a workspace whose path is a subdirectory of the directory containing the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    3. Victim user triggers the beautify command (e.g., "Beautify File" or "Beautify Selection").
    4. The extension's configuration lookup mechanism searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` files, starting from the file's directory and traversing upwards.
    5. The malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in the parent directory (e.g., home directory) is found and its configuration is loaded.
    6. The beautifier applies the settings from the malicious configuration file, leading to unexpected and potentially harmful formatting of the victim's code.
2. **Scenario 2 (Symlink Attack):**
    1. Attacker creates a malicious project and includes a symbolic link named `.jsbeautifyrc` in the project root.
    2. This symlink is configured to point to an arbitrary file outside of the workspace, which could be a malicious configuration file controlled by the attacker or a sensitive system file.
    3. Victim user opens the malicious project in VSCode.
    4. Victim user opens a supported document within the project and triggers the beautification process.
    5. The extension searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` and finds the symlink.
    6. The extension follows the symlink, reads the content of the target file, and attempts to parse it as a beautifier configuration.
    7. The beautifier applies the settings from the file pointed to by the symlink, leading to unexpected formatting or potentially disclosing information if a sensitive file was targeted.

**Impact:**
Unexpected and potentially harmful code formatting changes across multiple projects. This could lead to:
- Introduction of subtle bugs due to unexpected code modifications.
- Code obfuscation, making code harder to read and maintain.
- Developer frustration and reduced productivity due to unexpected beautifier behavior.
- Potential supply chain issues if developers unknowingly commit unintentionally modified code into version control systems.
- In the case of symlink attack, potential leakage of sensitive information if the symlink targets a sensitive file.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. The extension currently implements the configuration lookup as described, without restrictions on the scope, symlink checks, or warnings about configurations loaded from outside the workspace. The code verifies that a file exists using `fs.existsSync` before attempting to read it, but this does not prevent symlink following or reading files outside the intended scope.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Restrict `.jsbeautifyrc` lookup scope:** Limit the search for `.jsbeautifyrc` files to the current VSCode workspace folder and its subdirectories. Do not search in parent directories outside the workspace.
- **Workspace-level configuration precedence:** Ensure that workspace-level settings and `.jsbeautifyrc` files within the workspace always take precedence over any configurations found in parent directories outside the workspace (if parent directory lookup is to be retained at all).
- **User warning for external configurations:** If configuration files are loaded from outside the current workspace (e.g., from the home directory), display a warning message to the user, indicating that a global or external configuration is being applied and from where it is loaded.
- **Configuration scope setting:** Provide a user setting to control the scope of `.jsbeautifyrc` lookup (e.g., "workspace only", "workspace and parent directories", "workspace and home directory", "system-wide").
- **Symlink validation:**  When `.jsbeautifyrc` is found, check if it is a symbolic link using `fs.lstatSync` and reject symlinks to prevent following them.
- **Verification that `.jsbeautifyrc` is a regular file:** Ensure that the found `.jsbeautifyrc` is a regular file and not other types of files (like directories or special files).

**Preconditions:**
1. **Parent Directory Configuration Injection:**
    1. Attacker has the ability to place a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a directory that is a parent of the victim's workspace (e.g., user's home directory).
    2. Victim user opens a VSCode workspace or file within such a workspace.
    3. Victim user triggers the beautify command.
2. **Symlink Attack:**
    1. Attacker can influence the repository file structure (for example, in a malicious project) to include a symlink named `.jsbeautifyrc`.
    2. The symlink points to a file outside of the expected configuration directory.
    3. The victim opens the malicious repository in Visual Studio Code while the extension is active.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **`options.js:module.exports`**: This is the main function that determines beautification options.
2. **`options.js:getWorkspaceRoot(doc)`**: Determines the workspace root. If no workspace, it might return `vscode.workspace.rootPath` (deprecated) or undefined, potentially leading to system root being considered as root in some scenarios if not handled properly in `findRecursive`.
3. **`options.js:findRecursive(dir, fileName, root)`**: Recursively searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` starting from `dir` and going up to `root`.
    ```javascript
    const findRecursive = (dir, fileName, root) => {
      const fullPath = path.join(dir, fileName);
      const nextDir = path.dirname(dir);
      let result = fs.existsSync(fullPath) ? fullPath : null;
      if (!result && nextDir !== dir && dir !== root) { // Condition `dir !== root` controls the upward traversal limit.
        result = findRecursive(nextDir, fileName, root); // Recursive call to parent directory.
      }
      return result;
    };
    ```
    - The `root` variable, determined in `module.exports`, controls how far up the directory tree the search goes. If `root` is not strictly limited to the workspace, the search can go beyond the intended scope.
    - `fs.existsSync(fullPath)` returns true for symlinks, and there is no check to differentiate between regular files and symlinks.
4. **`options.js:module.exports`**: Calls `findRecursive` with the determined `dir`, filename `.jsbeautifyrc`, and `root`. If a `.jsbeautifyrc` (or symlink to it) is found in a parent directory (potentially outside the workspace), its settings are loaded and applied.
5. **`fs.readFile`**: Used to read the content of the found `.jsbeautifyrc` file (or the target of a symlink) without any validation of the file type or origin.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Malicious Configuration (Parent Directory Injection):**
    - Create a directory structure: `/tmp/malicious_config/.jsbeautifyrc` and `/tmp/victim_workspace/test.js`.
    - In `/tmp/malicious_config/.jsbeautifyrc`, place the following malicious configuration:
        ```json
        {
          "indent_size": 8,
          "indent_char": "\t"
        }
        ```
    - Ensure that `/tmp/malicious_config` is a parent directory of `/tmp/victim_workspace`.
    - Create a test Javascript file `/tmp/victim_workspace/test.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        function test(){
          var a = 1;
        }
        ```
2. **Setup Malicious Configuration (Symlink Attack):**
    - Create a directory `/tmp/symlink_attack_workspace`.
    - Inside `/tmp/symlink_attack_workspace`, create a symlink named `.jsbeautifyrc` pointing to `/tmp/malicious_config/.jsbeautifyrc` created in the previous test case, or to any other file containing malicious beautify configuration.
    - Create a test Javascript file `/tmp/symlink_attack_workspace/test.js` with the same content as above.
3. **VSCode Setup:**
    - Open VSCode.
    - Open the folder `/tmp/victim_workspace` (for parent directory injection) or `/tmp/symlink_attack_workspace` (for symlink attack) as a workspace in VSCode (`File -> Open Folder...`).
    - Open the file `test.js` in the editor.
4. **Trigger Beautify:**
    - Execute the "Beautify File" command.
5. **Verify Vulnerability:**
    - Observe the formatted content of `test.js`.
    - **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** The code in `test.js` will be formatted with an indent size of 8 tabs, as defined in the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file located in the parent directory or pointed to by the symlink.
    - **Expected Secure Behavior (Mitigated):** The code in `test.js` should be formatted using either default settings or workspace-specific settings, but *not* with the settings from the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file if the mitigation is to restrict lookup to workspace only and reject symlinks. If the mitigation is to warn, a warning should be displayed, and the formatting may or may not be as per the malicious config depending on precedence rules after mitigation.


#### 2. Arbitrary File Read via `beautify.config` Workspace Setting

**Description:**
The js-beautify extension allows users to specify a configuration file path using the `beautify.config` setting in VSCode's workspace or user settings. This setting is intended to point to a `.jsbeautifyrc` file. However, the extension does not sufficiently validate or restrict the file path provided in `beautify.config`. A malicious actor, by compromising workspace settings (e.g., through a crafted workspace configuration shared via a repository or social engineering), could set `beautify.config` to an absolute path pointing to any file on the user's file system that the VSCode process has permissions to read. When the extension attempts to load beautifier settings, it will read the file specified in `beautify.config`, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

**Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
1. Attacker crafts a malicious workspace configuration (e.g., `settings.json` in `.vscode` folder) that sets the `beautify.config` setting to point to a sensitive file on the user's system, such as `/etc/passwd` or a private key file (assuming VSCode process has read permissions). Example malicious setting: `"beautify.config": "/etc/passwd"`.
2. Attacker distributes this malicious workspace (e.g., by hosting it in a public repository or sending it to the victim).
3. Victim user opens the malicious workspace in VSCode. VSCode automatically loads the workspace settings, including the malicious `beautify.config` value.
4. Victim user triggers the beautify command on any file within the workspace.
5. The extension attempts to load beautifier options. It reads the `beautify.config` setting, which now points to the attacker-specified file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
6. The extension attempts to read and parse the content of the file specified in `beautify.config`. Although parsing might fail if the target file is not a valid JSON, the file content is still read by the extension.
7. While the extension might show an error message about parsing failure, the arbitrary file read has already occurred.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary file read. An attacker can potentially read any file on the user's system that the VSCode process has permissions to access. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as:
- System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` - if permissions allow).
- Private keys, API keys, or credentials stored in files.
- Source code or intellectual property.
- User data and personal information.
- Potential injection of untrusted configuration into the beautifier process if the attacker can provide a file with valid JSON.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- `options.js`: Checks if the configured path exists using `fs.existsSync(configFile)`. However, this only verifies existence and does not prevent reading arbitrary files if the path is valid and accessible to the VSCode process.
- The file is read only if the workspace setting (`beautify.config`) is provided by the user or workspace configuration.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Path validation and sanitization:** Validate the `beautify.config` path to ensure it is within the workspace directory or a designated safe configuration directory. Prevent absolute paths or paths that traverse outside the allowed scope.
- **Path restriction:** Restrict the `beautify.config` setting to only accept relative paths within the workspace. Resolve these paths relative to the workspace root to prevent access to locations outside the workspace.
- **User warning for external paths:** If an absolute path or an external path is provided in `beautify.config`, display a warning message to the user, indicating the potential security risk of loading configurations from arbitrary locations.
- **Input sanitization:** Sanitize the input path to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., by resolving and canonicalizing paths).

**Preconditions:**
1. Attacker can influence the `beautify.config` workspace setting (e.g., by providing a malicious workspace configuration).
2. Victim user opens the malicious workspace in VSCode.
3. Victim user triggers the beautify command.
4. The targeted file exists and is accessible by the user’s account.
5. The workspace is trusted or the security model does not enforce strict workspace–trust validation.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **`options.js:module.exports`**: Retrieves the `beautify.config` setting using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('beautify').config`.
2. **`options.js:module.exports`**: Handles the `beautify_config` string case:
    ```javascript
    if (typeof beautify_config === 'string') {
        if (path.isAbsolute(beautify_config)) configFile = beautify_config; // If absolute, directly use it. VULNERABLE!
        else configFile = path.resolve(root, beautify_config); // If relative, resolve against workspace root.

        configFile = fs.existsSync(configFile) ? configFile : null; // Check if file exists, but doesn't prevent reading if path is malicious.
    }
    ```
    - If `beautify_config` is a string and is an absolute path, it's directly assigned to `configFile` without validation. This allows specifying any absolute file path.
    - `fs.existsSync` only checks for file existence, not path security.
3. **`fs.readFile`**: Used to read the content of the `configFile` without validating if it's within the workspace or a safe location.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Malicious Workspace Configuration:**
    - Create a new directory, e.g., `/tmp/malicious_workspace`.
    - Inside `/tmp/malicious_workspace`, create a `.vscode` directory.
    - Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content. Replace `/etc/passwd` with a path to a sensitive file accessible to your VSCode process if `/etc/passwd` is not readable.
        ```json
        {
          "beautify.config": "/etc/passwd"
        }
        ```
    - Create a dummy Javascript file in `/tmp/malicious_workspace`, e.g., `test.js` with any Javascript content.
2. **VSCode Setup:**
    - Open VSCode.
    - Open the folder `/tmp/malicious_workspace` as a workspace in VSCode (`File -> Open Folder... -> /tmp/malicious_workspace`).
    - Open the file `test.js` in the editor.
3. **Trigger Beautify:**
    - Execute the "Beautify File" command.
4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
    - While you might see an error message in VSCode about failing to parse `/etc/passwd` as a JSON file, the vulnerability is confirmed if the extension attempts to read the content of `/etc/passwd`.
    - To more directly verify file read, you can use system monitoring tools (like `strace` on Linux or `Process Monitor` on Windows) to observe file system access by the VSCode process when beautifying. Look for file access to `/etc/passwd` or the file you specified in `beautify.config`.
    - Alternatively, modify `options.js` temporarily to log the `configFile` path before `fs.readFile` to confirm that the path is indeed set to `/etc/passwd`.


#### 3. Unexpected Code Reformatting via Malicious Project Configuration

**Description:**
An attacker can create a project containing a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` configuration file with unexpected or disruptive formatting settings. When a victim opens this project in VS Code with the "Beautify" extension installed and uses the beautifier, the extension will apply the malicious formatting settings from the `.jsbeautifyrc` file. This can lead to significant and unexpected changes in the victim's code, potentially introducing subtle bugs, hindering code readability, and disrupting the development process.

**Steps to trigger vulnerability:**
1. Attacker creates a new project or modifies an existing one.
2. Attacker places a `.jsbeautifyrc` file in the root directory of the project (or any directory in the path tree of the files to be beautified).
3. Attacker crafts the `.jsbeautifyrc` file with malicious or disruptive formatting configurations. For example, setting extreme indentation, unusual line breaks, or disabling newline at the end of file. An example of malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` content:
    ```json
    {
        "indent_size": 10,
        "indent_char": " ",
        "end_with_newline": false,
        "preserve_newlines": false
    }
    ```
4. Attacker tricks a victim into opening this project in VS Code with the "Beautify" extension installed.
5. Victim opens a code file (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS) within the project in VS Code.
6. Victim triggers the beautification command, either manually or automatically (if "editor.formatOnSave" is enabled).
7. The "Beautify" extension reads the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file and applies the defined formatting rules to the victim's code.
8. The victim's code is now unexpectedly and potentially disruptively reformatted according to the attacker's malicious configuration.

**Impact:**
- **Code Integrity**: Unexpected and unwanted code reformatting can make the code harder to read and understand, potentially leading to subtle bugs being introduced or overlooked.
- **Development Disruption**:  Developers may waste time trying to understand and revert the unexpected formatting changes. Code reviews become more difficult due to large, formatting-related diffs.
- **Loss of Productivity**: The unexpected changes and the effort to fix them can significantly reduce developer productivity.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- **Configuration File Search Order**: The extension searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` files in the file's path tree, up to the project root, and also in the home directory. This is documented in the `README.md`. However, it does not prevent malicious files from being loaded if they are placed in the project structure.
- **User Awareness (Implicit)**: Users who are familiar with VS Code extensions and configuration files might be aware that extensions can read configuration files from the project. However, this is not an explicit mitigation provided by the extension itself.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Warning on Configuration File Detection**: The extension should display a warning message when a `.jsbeautifyrc` file is detected within the workspace, especially if it significantly overrides user or workspace settings. This warning could inform the user about the configuration file and prompt them to review its content.
- **Configuration File Validation**: The extension could implement validation for `.jsbeautifyrc` files to detect potentially harmful settings or setting combinations. This could be complex, as "harmful" formatting is subjective. However, detecting extremely large indentation sizes or disabling essential formatting rules might be possible.
- **Option to Ignore Project `.jsbeautifyrc` Files**: Provide a setting to allow users to ignore `.jsbeautifyrc` files found in the project and only rely on user or workspace settings. This would give users more control over the formatting process, especially when working with untrusted projects.
- **Secure Defaults and Limits**: While not directly preventing the vulnerability, having more secure default formatting settings and enforcing limits on certain parameters (e.g., maximum indentation size) could reduce the potential impact of malicious configurations.

**Preconditions:**
- Victim has VS Code installed.
- Victim has the "Beautify" extension installed.
- Victim opens a project containing a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in VS Code.
- Victim uses the beautifier command on a code file within the project.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1.  **`options.js` - Configuration Loading:**
    The `options.js` file is responsible for loading beautifier options. The `module.exports` function in `options.js` is the entry point for retrieving options.
    ```javascript
    module.exports = (doc, type, formattingOptions) => {
      // ...
      let dir = doc.isUntitled ? root : path.dirname(doc.fileName);
      let configFile = dir ? findRecursive(dir, '.jsbeautifyrc', root) : null;
      // ...
      if (!configFile) {
        let beautify_config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('beautify')
          .config;
        // ...
      }
      if (!configFile && root) {
        configFile = findRecursive(path.dirname(root), '.jsbeautifyrc');
      }
      if (!configFile) {
        configFile = path.join(os.homedir(), '.jsbeautifyrc');
        if (!fs.existsSync(configFile)) return Promise.resolve(opts);
      }
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(configFile, 'utf8', (e, d) => { // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Reading .jsbeautifyrc file
          // ...
          try {
            const unCommented = dropComments(d.toString());
            opts = JSON.parse(unCommented); // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Parsing .jsbeautifyrc content
            opts = mergeOpts(opts, type);
            resolve(opts);
          } catch (e) {
            // ...
          }
        });
      });
    };
    ```
    - The code uses `findRecursive` to search for `.jsbeautifyrc` starting from the project directory.
    - If a `.jsbeautifyrc` file is found within the project, its content is read using `fs.readFile` and parsed using `JSON.parse`. There is no validation or sanitization of the configuration content before it's used by the beautifier.

2.  **`extension.js` - Applying Options:**
    The `extension.js` file uses the options loaded by `options.js` to beautify the code.
    ```javascript
    const beautifyDocRanges = (doc, ranges, type, formattingOptions, isPartial) => {
      // ...
      return Promise.resolve(type ? type : getBeautifyType())
        .then(type => options(doc, type, formattingOptions) // [POINT OF VULNERABILITY] Loading options, potentially from malicious .jsbeautifyrc
          .then(config => removeNewLineEndForPartial(config, isPartial))
          .then(config => Promise.all(ranges.map(range =>
            beautify[type](doc.getText(range), config))))); // Applying beautifier with loaded config
    };
    ```
    - The `beautifyDocRanges` function calls `options(doc, type, formattingOptions)` to get the beautification configuration.
    - This configuration, potentially loaded from a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc`, is then directly passed to the `beautify[type]` function along with the code to be beautified.

**Security Test Case:**
**Pre-requisites:**
- VS Code with "Beautify" extension installed.
- A test project directory.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new directory named `test-project`.
2. Inside `test-project`, create a file named `.jsbeautifyrc` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "indent_size": 10,
        "indent_char": " ",
        "end_with_newline": false,
        "preserve_newlines": false
    }
    ```
3. Inside `test-project`, create a JavaScript file named `test.js` with the following content:
    ```javascript
    function testFunction() {
      var a = 1;
    }
    ```
4. Open VS Code and open the `test-project` directory as a workspace.
5. Open the `test.js` file in VS Code editor.
6. Execute the "Beautify File" command.
7. **Observe the changes in `test.js`**.

**Expected Result:**
The `test.js` file should be reformatted according to the settings in `.jsbeautifyrc`. Specifically, you should observe:
- Indentation of 10 spaces.
- No newline character at the end of the file.

**Verification:**
After running the test case, the content of `test.js` should be reformatted with the malicious configuration applied, demonstrating the vulnerability.
