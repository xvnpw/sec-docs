Okay, I understand the instructions.

You've provided a response saying "No vulnerabilities found" for the js-beautify VS Code extension after applying the filters for external attacker scenarios and high/critical severity.

**Given your response "No vulnerabilities found", and assuming you have correctly applied the filtering criteria as described, then the appropriate output is indeed "No vulnerabilities found".**

This indicates that after analyzing potential vulnerabilities and filtering based on the instructions, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank, exploitable by an external attacker in the VSCode extension context, were identified that meet the inclusion criteria.

Therefore, the provided response is consistent with the instructions if no qualifying vulnerabilities exist after filtering.

**Final Answer:**

**No vulnerabilities found.**
