Okay, I understand. It seems there was a misunderstanding and you haven't provided the lists of vulnerabilities yet. Based on your analysis and conclusion "No vulnerabilities found" for the js-beautify VS Code extension after some filtering, I will provide a markdown output reflecting this conclusion.

If you intended to provide vulnerability lists later, please provide them and I will combine them as requested in the initial instructions.

For now, based on the provided context and your conclusion, here is the markdown output indicating "No vulnerabilities found":

```markdown
### Combined Vulnerability List for js-beautify VSCode Extension

Based on the analysis and filtering process, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were found in the js-beautify VSCode extension.

**No vulnerabilities found.**
```

If you have the actual vulnerability lists you want me to combine, please provide them, and I will process them according to your initial instructions.
