## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Umi Version (Server-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_umi_version__server-side_.md)

*   **1a. Known CVEs -> HIGH RISK ->**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) in specific versions of the UmiJS framework. Exploit code for these vulnerabilities is often readily available.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on update frequency. Higher if updates are infrequent.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to complete server compromise, data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Publicly available exploits often exist.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Script kiddie level, if exploits are readily available.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can often detect known CVE exploits, but not always. Timely patching is crucial.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly update UmiJS to the latest stable version.
        *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process (e.g., using tools that check for known CVEs).
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block known exploit attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Umi Plugin (Server-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_umi_plugin__server-side_.md)

*   **2a. Exposed Dev Tools -> HIGH RISK ->**
    *   **Description:** UmiJS provides development tools (e.g., for debugging, inspecting the application state, etc.) that should *never* be accessible in a production environment. If these tools are exposed, attackers can gain access to sensitive information, manipulate the application's behavior, or potentially even execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake, especially in staging environments or due to misconfiguration.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can expose sensitive information, allow for application manipulation, and potentially lead to code execution.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simply accessing a specific URL or endpoint.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of web applications and how to use browser developer tools.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring access logs for requests to known development tool endpoints. Network traffic analysis can also reveal access to these tools.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure that the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` in the production environment. UmiJS automatically disables many development features in production mode.
        *   Verify that no development-only routes or endpoints are accessible in production.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or web server configuration to explicitly block access to development tool paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Server-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__server-side_.md)

*   **3a. Known CVEs in Umi or its Dependencies -> HIGH RISK ->**
    *   **Description:** UmiJS, like any framework, relies on numerous third-party libraries (dependencies). These dependencies may have their own vulnerabilities (CVEs). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, even if UmiJS itself is up-to-date.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the number of dependencies, their update frequency, and the overall security posture of the dependency ecosystem.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Varies depending on the vulnerable dependency. Could range from minor issues to complete server compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits may be publicly available, or some modification might be needed. Automated tools can often find and exploit these vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Script kiddie to intermediate, depending on exploit availability and complexity.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools and vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies. However, timely patching and dependency management are crucial.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and track vulnerabilities in all dependencies.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a dependency pinning strategy to prevent unexpected updates from introducing new vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Route Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_route_hijacking.md)

*   **4b. Bypass Auth Checks via Routes -> HIGH RISK ->**
    *   **Description:** If authentication and authorization checks are implemented *solely* on the client-side (e.g., using route guards in UmiJS), attackers can often bypass these checks by directly navigating to protected routes or manipulating client-side code. This allows them to access resources they should not have access to.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability if developers rely solely on client-side security.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Allows unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious actions.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simply navigating to a protected URL or using browser developer tools to modify client-side code.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of web applications and how to use browser developer tools.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring access logs for unauthorized access to protected resources. Server-side authentication failures can also indicate attempts to bypass client-side checks.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization checks. Client-side checks should be considered a secondary layer of defense, *not* the primary one.
        *   Use a well-established authentication and authorization library or framework.
        *   Ensure that all API endpoints that require authentication are properly protected on the server.
        *   Use techniques like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session management to securely track user authentication state on the server.
