# Deep Analysis: Build Process Manipulation (Compromised CI/CD - Umi Build)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Build Process Manipulation" threat specific to the Umi.js framework within a CI/CD environment.  This includes identifying specific attack vectors, potential vulnerabilities within the Umi build process, and refining mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level descriptions.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to significantly reduce the risk of this threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **Umi.js Build Process:**  Understanding how Umi compiles, bundles, and optimizes code, including the roles of `config/config.ts`, `package.json` scripts, and any other relevant configuration files.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**  Examining how the Umi build process is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI).  This includes identifying specific pipeline configuration files and scripts that control the build.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Analyzing how Umi manages dependencies (e.g., npm, yarn) and the potential for malicious packages to be introduced.
*   **Build Artifact Storage:**  Understanding where build artifacts are stored (e.g., artifact repositories, cloud storage) and the security controls in place.
*   **Umi Plugins and Extensions:**  Assessing the security implications of any custom or third-party Umi plugins used in the project.

This analysis *excludes* general CI/CD security best practices that are not directly related to Umi.js.  For example, while securing SSH keys for server access is important, it's outside the scope unless those keys are specifically used to manipulate the Umi build process.

### 1.3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough review of Umi.js official documentation, CI/CD platform documentation, and any relevant project-specific documentation.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Static analysis of the project's Umi configuration files (`config/config.ts`, `.umirc.ts`, etc.), `package.json` scripts, and CI/CD pipeline configuration files.
3.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examination of the project's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.  This will also include a review of the dependency lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`).
4.  **Threat Modeling (STRIDE/DREAD):**  Applying threat modeling techniques to identify specific attack vectors and assess their impact and likelihood.
5.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for known vulnerabilities in Umi.js, its dependencies, and related CI/CD tools.
6.  **Best Practice Comparison:**  Comparing the project's current implementation against industry best practices for secure CI/CD and Umi.js development.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors

An attacker could manipulate the Umi build process through several attack vectors:

*   **Compromised CI/CD Credentials:**  Gaining access to the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) through stolen credentials, phishing attacks, or leaked secrets.  This would allow the attacker to directly modify the pipeline configuration.
*   **Malicious Pull Request:**  Submitting a seemingly legitimate pull request that subtly modifies the Umi configuration or build scripts to inject malicious code.  This relies on insufficient code review processes.
*   **Dependency Poisoning:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in a project dependency or publishing a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency (typosquatting).  This could lead to the execution of malicious code during the build process.
*   **Compromised Build Server:**  Gaining direct access to the build server (e.g., through SSH vulnerabilities, weak passwords) and modifying files or configurations.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or compromised developer with legitimate access to the codebase or CI/CD pipeline intentionally injecting malicious code.
*   **Vulnerable Umi Plugin:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in a custom or third-party Umi plugin to execute arbitrary code during the build.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Dependency Downloads:**  Intercepting and modifying packages downloaded from npm or yarn during the build process.  This is less likely with HTTPS but still a potential risk.

### 2.2. Specific Umi.js Vulnerabilities

While Umi.js itself may not have specific, publicly known vulnerabilities that directly enable build process manipulation, the *configuration* and *usage* of Umi can introduce vulnerabilities:

*   **`config/config.ts` (or `.umirc.ts`) Manipulation:**  This file controls many aspects of the Umi build.  An attacker could:
    *   Modify `chainWebpack` to inject arbitrary code into the Webpack configuration.
    *   Change `publicPath` to point to a malicious CDN.
    *   Alter `proxy` settings to redirect API requests to a malicious server.
    *   Disable security features like `hash` (file hashing for cache busting) to make it easier to replace files with malicious versions.
    *   Modify `define` to inject malicious environment variables.
*   **`package.json` Script Manipulation:**  Attackers could modify the `scripts` section of `package.json` to execute arbitrary commands during the build process (e.g., `prebuild`, `postbuild`, `build`).
*   **Unsafe Plugin Usage:**  Using a poorly written or malicious Umi plugin that executes arbitrary code during the build process.  Plugins have significant power within the Umi build ecosystem.
*   **Dynamic Code Evaluation (Indirect):**  If the application uses `eval()` or similar functions, and the build process is manipulated to inject code into variables used by these functions, it could lead to runtime code execution. This is an indirect vulnerability related to the build process.

### 2.3. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deeper analysis, the following refined mitigation strategies are recommended:

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to CI/CD service accounts.  Avoid using overly permissive roles.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all users and service accounts with access to the CI/CD platform.
    *   **Secrets Management:**  Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions secrets) to store sensitive credentials and API keys.  *Never* hardcode secrets in configuration files.
    *   **Pipeline as Code:**  Treat CI/CD pipeline configuration as code, storing it in a version-controlled repository and subjecting it to the same code review and security checks as application code.
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Enable detailed audit logging for all CI/CD pipeline activity, including configuration changes, build executions, and deployments.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure.
    *   **Branch Protection Rules:**  Use branch protection rules (e.g., in GitHub) to require code reviews and status checks before merging changes to critical branches (e.g., `main`, `production`).
    *   **Restricted Runners:** Use self-hosted runners with restricted network access and limited privileges.

*   **Umi.js Specific Mitigations:**
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all changes to Umi configuration files (`config/config.ts`, `.umirc.ts`, etc.) and `package.json` scripts.  Pay close attention to any modifications to `chainWebpack`, `proxy`, `publicPath`, and `define`.
    *   **Dependency Management:**
        *   **Use a Lockfile:**  Always use a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency resolution across builds.
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:**  Consider pinning dependencies to specific versions (rather than using ranges) to reduce the risk of unexpected updates introducing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Private Package Registry:**  If feasible, use a private package registry (e.g., npm Enterprise, Artifactory) to host internal packages and control the supply chain.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Use SCA tools to automatically scan dependencies for vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.
    *   **Plugin Security:**
        *   **Carefully Vet Plugins:**  Thoroughly vet any third-party Umi plugins before using them.  Examine the plugin's code, reputation, and maintenance history.
        *   **Limit Plugin Usage:**  Minimize the use of unnecessary plugins to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Regularly Update Plugins:**  Keep all Umi plugins up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Signing:**  Implement code signing for the built Umi application to ensure that only trusted code is executed.  This can be done using tools like OpenSSL or platform-specific code signing services.
    *   **Immutable Build Artifacts:**  Treat build artifacts as immutable.  Once a build is complete, the artifact should never be modified.  Any changes should require a new build.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities that might be introduced through build process manipulation.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI to ensure that the browser only loads JavaScript and CSS files with a specific, expected hash. This helps prevent the loading of maliciously modified files.

*   **Build Server Security:**
    *   **Harden the Build Server:**  Apply security hardening best practices to the build server operating system and software.
    *   **Restrict Network Access:**  Limit network access to the build server to only necessary sources.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep the build server operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Implement an IDS to monitor for suspicious activity on the build server.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Build Log Monitoring:**  Implement automated monitoring of build logs for suspicious activity, such as unexpected changes to files, execution of unusual commands, or failed builds.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify the development team of any suspicious activity detected in the build process.
