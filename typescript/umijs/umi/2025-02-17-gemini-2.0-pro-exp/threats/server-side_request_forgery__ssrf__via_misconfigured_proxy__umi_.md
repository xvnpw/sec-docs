# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Misconfigured Proxy (Umi)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability stemming from misconfigured proxy settings within the Umi framework.  This includes identifying the root causes, potential attack vectors, exploitation scenarios, and refining the proposed mitigation strategies to ensure their effectiveness.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to prevent this vulnerability.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `proxy` configuration option within Umi's `config/config.ts` file and its interaction with Umi's internal proxy handling mechanisms.  We will consider:

*   **Direct user input:**  Scenarios where user-provided data directly influences the proxy target (e.g., a user-supplied URL).
*   **Indirect user input:**  Scenarios where user input is used to construct or modify the proxy target, even if not directly specifying the full URL.
*   **Default configurations:**  The security implications of Umi's default proxy settings and how they might be exploited if left unchanged.
*   **Interaction with other Umi features:**  How other Umi features, such as API routes or server-side rendering, might interact with the proxy and potentially exacerbate the SSRF risk.
*   **Bypassing mitigations:** We will attempt to identify ways an attacker might try to circumvent the proposed mitigation strategies.

This analysis *excludes* general SSRF vulnerabilities unrelated to Umi's proxy feature.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in external proxy servers (like Nginx or HAProxy) that might be used *in addition to* Umi's proxy.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the Umi documentation and, if available, relevant parts of the Umi source code related to proxy handling.  This will help understand the intended behavior and potential weaknesses.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Use the existing threat model as a starting point and expand upon it by considering various attack scenarios and attacker motivations.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known SSRF vulnerabilities and techniques, adapting them to the specific context of Umi's proxy.
*   **Hypothetical Exploitation:**  Develop proof-of-concept (PoC) scenarios to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited in a controlled environment.  This will *not* involve actual exploitation of production systems.
*   **Mitigation Validation:**  Critically evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies and identify potential weaknesses or bypasses.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the SSRF Threat

### 2.1. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this SSRF vulnerability is the combination of:

1.  **Umi's built-in proxy functionality:**  Umi provides a convenient way to proxy requests, which is inherently susceptible to SSRF if not configured securely.
2.  **Misconfiguration of the `proxy` option:**  Developers might inadvertently (or through lack of security awareness) configure the proxy to allow requests to arbitrary destinations, including internal services.
3.  **Insufficient input validation:**  User-supplied data, either directly or indirectly, might be used to control the proxy target without proper sanitization or validation.

### 2.2. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

Several attack vectors can lead to SSRF exploitation:

*   **Direct URL Control:**  The most straightforward attack involves a scenario where a user can directly provide a URL that is then used by the Umi proxy.  For example:

    ```javascript
    // config/config.ts (VULNERABLE)
    export default {
      proxy: {
        '/api': {
          target: 'http://example.com', // Placeholder, attacker controls this
          changeOrigin: true,
        },
      },
    };
    ```
    An attacker could then make a request like `/api?target=http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data` which, if `target` parameter is used to build target URL, would cause the Umi proxy to fetch data from the internal service.

*   **Indirect URL Control (Path Manipulation):**  Even if the `target` is hardcoded, an attacker might manipulate the request path to access unintended resources.  For example:

    ```javascript
    // config/config.ts (VULNERABLE)
    export default {
      proxy: {
        '/api': {
          target: 'http://external-api.com',
          changeOrigin: true,
          pathRewrite: { '^/api': '' }, // Potentially vulnerable
        },
      },
    };
    ```

    An attacker might send a request to `/api/../../internal-service/data`.  If the `pathRewrite` logic doesn't properly handle `..` sequences, the proxy might forward the request to `http://external-api.com/../../internal-service/data`, which could resolve to an internal server if DNS or network configuration allows it.  This is less likely with `pathRewrite` but highlights the need for careful configuration.

*   **Indirect URL Control (Parameter Manipulation):**  The application might use user-supplied parameters to construct the proxy target URL.

    ```javascript
    // config/config.ts (VULNERABLE)
    export default {
      proxy: {
        '/api': {
          // target is dynamically built based on user input (e.g., from a database)
          target: `http://${getDomainFromDatabase()}`,
          changeOrigin: true,
        },
      },
    };
    ```

    If `getDomainFromDatabase()` retrieves a value influenced by user input without proper validation, an attacker could inject an internal server address.

*   **Schema Smuggling:** An attacker might try to use different URL schemas (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`, `dict://`) to access local files or interact with other services on the server.  This depends on the underlying libraries Umi uses for proxying.

*   **DNS Rebinding:**  A sophisticated attacker could use DNS rebinding to bypass hostname-based allow-lists.  This involves controlling a DNS server that initially resolves a domain to a permitted IP address but then changes the resolution to an internal IP address after the initial check.

### 2.3. Bypassing Mitigation Strategies

Let's analyze how an attacker might try to bypass the proposed mitigations:

*   **Allow-list Bypass (Hostname):**
    *   **Typosquatting:**  The attacker registers a domain very similar to an allowed domain (e.g., `example.com` vs. `examp1e.com`).
    *   **Unicode Normalization Issues:**  If the allow-list uses a specific Unicode normalization form, the attacker might use a different form to bypass the check.
    *   **Case Sensitivity:**  If the allow-list is case-sensitive, the attacker might use a different case.
    *   **Subdomain Control:** If the allow-list allows `*.example.com`, and the attacker can control a subdomain (e.g., through a compromised account or a misconfigured DNS record), they can point it to an internal server.

*   **Allow-list Bypass (IP Address):**
    *   **IP Address Representations:**  The attacker might use different representations of the same IP address (e.g., decimal, octal, hexadecimal, with leading zeros) to bypass a simple string comparison.  For example, `127.0.0.1`, `0177.0.0.1`, `0x7f.0.0.1` all represent localhost.
    *   **IPv6 Variations:**  Similar to IP address representations, IPv6 addresses have multiple valid representations.

*   **Input Validation Bypass:**
    *   **Null Bytes:**  Injecting null bytes (`%00`) might truncate the input string prematurely, bypassing validation checks.
    *   **Encoding Issues:**  Double URL encoding, or using different character encodings, might bypass validation routines.
    *   **Regular Expression Weaknesses:**  If regular expressions are used for validation, they might be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) or have flaws that allow malicious input to pass.

*   **Dedicated Proxy Bypass:**  Even with a dedicated proxy server, misconfigurations (e.g., overly permissive `proxy_pass` directives in Nginx) can still lead to SSRF.  The dedicated proxy only shifts the responsibility; it doesn't eliminate the risk entirely.

### 2.4. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Based on the above analysis, we refine the mitigation strategies:

1.  **Strict Allow-list (Hostname and IP Address):**
    *   Use a *strict* allow-list of *fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)* and/or IP addresses.
    *   **Normalize hostnames** to a consistent format (lowercase, consistent Unicode normalization) *before* comparison.
    *   **Validate IP addresses** using a dedicated IP address parsing library (to handle different representations correctly).  *Do not* rely on simple string comparisons.
    *   **Avoid wildcard subdomains** in the allow-list unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.  If wildcards are used, implement additional controls to prevent subdomain takeover.
    *   **Regularly review and update** the allow-list.

2.  **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Validate *all* user input** that directly or indirectly influences the proxy target, even if it's not a full URL.
    *   Use a **whitelist approach** for validation: define what is *allowed* rather than trying to block what is *disallowed*.
    *   **Sanitize input** to remove any potentially dangerous characters or sequences (e.g., `../`, null bytes, control characters).
    *   Use **context-aware validation:**  The validation rules should be specific to the expected input format.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated security library** for input validation and sanitization.

3.  **Hardened Proxy Configuration:**
    *   **Prefer a dedicated, hardened proxy server (Nginx, HAProxy) for production.**  This provides more control and security features than Umi's built-in proxy.
    *   If using Umi's built-in proxy, **thoroughly review and test** the configuration.
    *   **Disable unnecessary features** in the proxy configuration.
    *   **Limit the scope of the proxy:**  Only proxy requests to the specific endpoints that require it.

4.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Enable detailed logging** for the proxy (both Umi's and any dedicated proxy server).
    *   **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**, such as requests to unusual IP addresses or URLs, high error rates, or unexpected request patterns.
    *   **Implement security alerts** for potentially malicious activity.

5.  **Defense in Depth:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Use network segmentation (e.g., firewalls, VLANs) to limit the impact of a successful SSRF attack.  Internal services should not be directly accessible from the public internet.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the Umi application and any proxy servers with the least privilege necessary.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

6. **Schema Restriction:**
    * Explicitly restrict the allowed URL schemas to `http` and `https`. Do not allow `file://`, `gopher://`, etc., unless there is a very specific and well-understood reason to do so. This should be enforced both in Umi's configuration and in any input validation logic.

7. **DNS Resolution Control (Advanced):**
    * If feasible, consider using a dedicated DNS resolver for the application that is configured to only resolve allowed domains. This can help prevent DNS rebinding attacks. This is a more advanced mitigation and may not be practical in all environments.

## 3. Conclusion

The SSRF vulnerability in Umi's proxy configuration poses a significant risk.  By understanding the root causes, attack vectors, and potential bypasses, we can implement robust mitigation strategies.  The refined recommendations emphasize a layered approach, combining strict allow-listing, robust input validation, secure proxy configuration, monitoring, and defense-in-depth principles.  Continuous vigilance and regular security reviews are crucial to maintaining a secure application. The development team should prioritize implementing these recommendations to prevent SSRF attacks.
