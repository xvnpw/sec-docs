## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Umi Plugin Management and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_umi_plugin_management_and_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Umi Plugin Management and Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **Plugin Inventory:** Maintain a documented list of *all* Umi plugins used in your project (`umi/plugin-xxx`, third-party plugins).
2.  **Official Documentation:** Thoroughly review the *official* Umi documentation for *each* plugin.  Pay close attention to:
    *   Security considerations sections.
    *   Configuration options related to security (e.g., access control, data handling).
    *   Known limitations or potential risks.
3.  **Source Code Review (Prioritized):** For *critical* plugins (those handling authentication, authorization, data access, or interacting with external services), perform a source code review if the plugin is open-source. Focus on:
    *   Input validation within the plugin's code.
    *   Secure handling of any user data or configuration passed to the plugin.
    *   Proper use of security mechanisms (e.g., CSRF protection if the plugin interacts with APIs).
    *   Avoidance of known insecure patterns.
4.  **Configuration Audit:**  Scrutinize the configuration of *each* plugin within your Umi configuration files (`config/config.ts`, `.umirc.ts`). Ensure:
    *   The principle of least privilege is applied: plugins only have the necessary permissions.
    *   Sensitive configuration values (API keys, secrets) are *not* hardcoded but are loaded from environment variables.
    *   All security-relevant configuration options are set to their most secure values.
5.  **Dependency Analysis (Plugin-Specific):** Use `npm ls <plugin-name>` or `yarn why <plugin-name>` to examine the *direct* dependencies of each Umi plugin.  Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` specifically targeting these dependencies to identify vulnerabilities within the plugin's ecosystem.
6.  **Plugin Selection Criteria:** Before adding *any* new Umi plugin:
    *   Prioritize official Umi plugins maintained by the Umi team.
    *   For third-party plugins, evaluate:
        *   Author reputation and responsiveness.
        *   Maintenance activity (recent commits, issue resolution).
        *   Number of downloads and community feedback.
        *   Presence of security-related documentation or discussions.
    *   If a plugin seems unmaintained or has questionable security, *strongly* consider alternatives or implementing the functionality yourself (if feasible and you have the security expertise).
7.  **Regular Updates (Umi and Plugins):** Keep both UmiJS itself *and* all installed plugins updated to their latest versions.  This is crucial for receiving security patches.  Use `npm update umi` and `npm update <plugin-name>` (or the `yarn` equivalents).  Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
8. **Plugin-Specific Security Measures:** Some plugins may require specific security configurations. For example:
    *   **`umi/plugin-access`:** Carefully define and test access control rules.
    *   **`umi/plugin-request`:** Ensure proper CSRF protection is in place for API requests made through this plugin.
    *   **`umi/plugin-dva` (if used for data fetching):** Ensure secure data handling and validation.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):**  Vulnerabilities introduced by the specific functionality of the plugin (e.g., XSS, CSRF, code injection, data breaches, privilege escalation).  The severity depends entirely on the plugin and the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities (within Plugins) (Variable Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the Umi plugins themselves.
*   **Misconfiguration Risks (Variable Severity):**  Security issues arising from incorrectly configuring a plugin, leading to unintended behavior or exposure.

**Impact:**
*   **Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  Reduces the risk significantly, with the degree depending on the thoroughness of the review and the plugin's complexity (50-95% reduction, highly variable).
*   **Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities (within Plugins):** Reduces the risk by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the plugin's dependency tree (60-80% reduction).
*   **Misconfiguration Risks:**  Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring plugins are configured securely (70-90% reduction).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Plugins are used, but no formal security review process is in place.
*   Umi and plugins are updated sporadically, not as part of a regular schedule.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formalized plugin inventory and documentation.
*   Prioritized source code review for critical plugins.
*   Configuration audit for all plugins.
*   Plugin-specific dependency analysis.
*   Defined criteria for plugin selection.
*   Automated Umi and plugin updates in CI/CD.
*   Specific security configurations for plugins like `umi/plugin-access` and `umi/plugin-request`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Umi Configuration and Build Process](./mitigation_strategies/secure_umi_configuration_and_build_process.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Umi Configuration and Build Process

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration File Review:** Thoroughly review all Umi configuration files (`config/config.ts`, `.umirc.ts`, and any environment-specific configuration files).
2.  **Secret Management:** Ensure that *no* secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) are stored directly in configuration files. Use environment variables exclusively for sensitive data.
3.  **Proxy Configuration (Development):** If using Umi's development proxy (`devServer.proxy` in `config/config.ts`):
    *   *Never* proxy to untrusted or external services without extreme caution and thorough validation.
    *   Ensure the proxy configuration is *not* accidentally included in production builds.  Use environment-specific configurations to disable the proxy in production.
4.  **Route Configuration:** Review your route configuration (`config/routes.ts` or similar) to ensure:
    *   Sensitive routes (e.g., admin panels) are properly protected and not accidentally exposed.
    *   Route-based code splitting is not inadvertently exposing sensitive code in publicly accessible chunks.
5.  **Code Splitting Review:** Analyze your code splitting configuration (often implicit in Umi) to ensure that sensitive code is not included in publicly accessible JavaScript bundles.
6. **Production Build Hardening:**
    *   Ensure that source maps are *disabled* in production builds (`config.devtool = false`). Source maps can reveal your source code to attackers.
    *   Enable minification and uglification to make reverse engineering more difficult. Umi usually handles this by default in production mode, but verify.
7. **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Use Umi's environment-specific configuration capabilities (e.g., `config/config.prod.ts`) to apply different security settings for development, testing, and production environments. For example, disable debugging features and enable stricter security measures in production.
8. **Review Umi's Security Recommendations:** Consult the official UmiJS documentation for any security recommendations or best practices related to configuration and the build process.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Critical):**  Preventing secrets from being stored in configuration files.
*   **Unauthorized Access (High):**  Ensuring sensitive routes are protected.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium/High):**  Preventing source code exposure through source maps.
*   **Reverse Engineering (Medium):**  Making it more difficult for attackers to understand your application's code.
*   **Proxy-Related Attacks (High):**  Mitigating risks associated with misconfigured development proxies.
*   **Code Injection (via Dynamic Imports - indirectly):** By ensuring proper route and code splitting configuration.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Eliminates the risk of direct exposure in configuration files (100% reduction).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Reduces the risk if routes are properly configured (70-90% reduction).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Eliminates the risk of source map exposure (100% reduction).
*   **Reverse Engineering:** Increases the difficulty for attackers (variable impact).
*   **Proxy-Related Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk if the proxy is configured securely (90-95% reduction).
* **Code Injection:** Indirectly reduces risk by ensuring secure configuration.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Umi configuration is in place.
*   Source maps are disabled in production.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive review of all configuration files.
*   Strict enforcement of environment variables for secrets.
*   Secure proxy configuration (or disabling it entirely in production).
*   Route and code splitting review for security.
*   Use of environment-specific configurations for security hardening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SSR Handling (Umi-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ssr_handling__umi-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure SSR Handling (Umi-Specific)

**Description:** (Specifically for projects using Umi's SSR feature)
1.  **Identify SSR Entry Points:** Determine which routes or components in your Umi application are rendered on the server.
2.  **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Use a robust HTML sanitization library *on the server* (e.g., `dompurify`, but configured for server-side use) to sanitize *any* user-provided data *before* it's included in the HTML rendered by Umi's SSR process. This is crucial to prevent XSS.  This is *not* the same as client-side sanitization.
3.  **Umi's `getInitialProps` Security:**  If you're using Umi's `getInitialProps` (or similar data-fetching methods) for SSR, ensure that:
    *   Data fetched from external APIs is done securely (HTTPS, authentication).
    *   Any user input used to construct API requests is properly validated and sanitized *before* being sent to the API.
    *   The data returned from the API is treated as potentially untrusted and is sanitized before being rendered.
4.  **Context-Aware Escaping (Server-Side):**  Ensure that any user input rendered within specific HTML contexts (attributes, JavaScript code) is properly escaped for that context *on the server*.  Umi's templating system (if it uses one) might provide automatic escaping, but *verify* this and understand its limitations.
5.  **Data Leakage Prevention:**  *Never* render sensitive data (passwords, session tokens, private user information) in the initial HTML payload generated by Umi's SSR.  This data should be fetched and rendered client-side *after* authentication.
6. **Review Umi's SSR Documentation:** Consult the official UmiJS documentation for any specific security recommendations or best practices related to SSR.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):**  Preventing XSS attacks that can occur when user input is rendered on the server without proper sanitization. This is the *primary* threat mitigated by this strategy.
*   **Data Leakage (High):**  Preventing sensitive data from being exposed in the initial HTML payload.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of server-side rendered XSS (by 80-90% with proper sanitization).
*   **Data Leakage:** Reduces the risk if sensitive data is handled correctly (by 70-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The project uses SSR.
*   Basic HTML escaping is used, but no dedicated server-side sanitization library.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implementation of a robust server-side HTML sanitization library (e.g., `dompurify` configured for server-side use).
*   Thorough review of all SSR code (including `getInitialProps` and any data-fetching logic) to ensure proper sanitization and escaping of user input.
*   Verification that sensitive data is *not* rendered in the initial HTML payload.
