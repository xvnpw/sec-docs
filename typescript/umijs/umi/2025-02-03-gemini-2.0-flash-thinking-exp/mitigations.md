# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for umijs/umi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure UmiJS Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_umijs_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review Configuration Files:** Regularly examine your UmiJS configuration files (`.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts`, and any other custom configuration files used by UmiJS features or plugins). Look for hardcoded sensitive information or misconfigurations that could weaken security.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Configuration:** Determine which configuration options in your UmiJS files handle sensitive data or control security-relevant features. This might include API endpoint configurations, authentication settings, or plugin configurations that manage access control.
    3.  **Externalize Sensitive Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive values directly within UmiJS configuration files. Instead, utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems to inject these values at runtime. Access them in your UmiJS configuration using `process.env`.
    4.  **Restrict Configuration File Access:** Ensure that UmiJS configuration files are not publicly accessible in production environments.  Proper file system permissions should be set to limit access to only authorized users and processes on the server.
    5.  **Version Control Considerations:** If configuration files are version controlled, be extremely cautious about committing sensitive information. Ideally, sensitive parts of configuration should be managed outside of version control and injected during deployment.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exposure of Secrets in Configuration (High Severity): Hardcoding API keys, credentials, or other secrets directly in UmiJS configuration files can lead to unauthorized access if these files are exposed or accidentally leaked (e.g., through version control history or misconfigured servers).
        *   Information Disclosure via Configuration (Medium Severity): Overly verbose or debug-oriented configurations left enabled in production can reveal internal application details or paths, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of Secrets in Configuration: High Risk Reduction - Prevents direct exposure of sensitive credentials within UmiJS configuration files, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
        *   Information Disclosure via Configuration: Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes the potential for information leakage through configuration settings by promoting secure configuration practices.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   Developers are generally aware of not hardcoding database credentials, which are loaded from environment variables in production.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   No automated checks to detect hardcoded secrets in all UmiJS configuration files during CI/CD.
        *   Formal guidelines for developers on secure configuration practices specifically for UmiJS applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Vet UmiJS Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_vet_umijs_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Plugin Requirements:** Before adding any UmiJS plugin, clearly define the exact functionality needed. Avoid adding plugins speculatively or for features that are not essential.
    2.  **Research Plugin Options (UmiJS Ecosystem):** Explore available UmiJS plugins within the official UmiJS plugin ecosystem and reputable community sources. Prioritize plugins specifically designed for UmiJS and documented as compatible.
    3.  **Evaluate Plugin Source and Maintainer (GitHub, npm):** For each potential plugin, investigate its source code repository (e.g., GitHub). Assess the plugin maintainer's reputation, activity, and responsiveness to issues. Look for signs of active development, recent updates, and a history of security awareness. Check npm download statistics and community feedback.
    4.  **Review Plugin Permissions and Capabilities (UmiJS Specific Features):** Understand what permissions and capabilities the UmiJS plugin requests or utilizes within the UmiJS framework. Some plugins might require access to routing, build processes, or other sensitive parts of the UmiJS application. Ensure these permissions are justified and necessary for the plugin's intended functionality.
    5.  **Test Plugin in Development Environment:** Before deploying any new UmiJS plugin to production, thoroughly test it in a development or staging environment. Verify its functionality, performance, and ensure it doesn't introduce unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities within the UmiJS application context.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malicious UmiJS Plugins (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of incorporating UmiJS plugins that contain malicious code specifically designed to exploit UmiJS features or vulnerabilities.
        *   Vulnerable UmiJS Plugins (High Severity): Minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through poorly maintained or insecure UmiJS plugins that might have security flaws in their UmiJS integration or core logic.
        *   Unintended Plugin Behavior within UmiJS Context (Medium Severity): Prevents unexpected or insecure interactions between plugins and the UmiJS framework due to poorly designed or incompatible plugins.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Malicious UmiJS Plugins: Medium Risk Reduction - Careful vetting significantly lowers the chance of using intentionally malicious UmiJS plugins.
        *   Vulnerable UmiJS Plugins: High Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities specific to UmiJS plugin integrations by selecting reputable and well-maintained plugins.
        *   Unintended Plugin Behavior within UmiJS Context: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves application stability and predictability by ensuring plugins are well-designed and compatible with UmiJS.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   Plugins are generally chosen based on advertised functionality and basic community popularity within the UmiJS ecosystem.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   Formalized plugin vetting process that includes source code review (when feasible), maintainer reputation assessment within the UmiJS community, and security-focused testing in a UmiJS environment.
        *   Centralized list or recommendations of pre-vetted and approved UmiJS plugins for project use.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize UmiJS Plugin Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_umijs_plugin_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for UmiJS Features:** Apply the principle of least privilege to UmiJS plugins. Only install and enable plugins that are absolutely necessary for your application's core functionality. Avoid using plugins for optional or non-essential features.
    2.  **Evaluate Alternatives to Plugins (UmiJS Core Features):** Before adding a plugin, consider if the desired functionality can be achieved using built-in UmiJS features, core React components, or standard JavaScript libraries without relying on a plugin.
    3.  **Disable Unused Plugin Features (Configuration):** If a plugin offers a wide range of features, but you only require a subset, carefully configure the plugin to enable only the necessary features and disable any unused or optional functionalities through UmiJS plugin configuration options.
    4.  **Regularly Audit and Remove Unnecessary Plugins:** Periodically review the list of UmiJS plugins used in your project. Remove any plugins that are no longer actively used or whose functionality is redundant or can be replaced by more secure or lightweight alternatives.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Increased UmiJS Attack Surface (Medium Severity): Unnecessary UmiJS plugins expand the application's attack surface within the UmiJS framework. Each plugin introduces new code, dependencies, and potential points of vulnerability within the UmiJS context.
        *   Vulnerability Propagation through UmiJS Plugins (Medium Severity): Even if unused, enabled UmiJS plugins can contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited if an attacker finds a way to trigger or interact with the plugin's code within the UmiJS application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Increased UmiJS Attack Surface: Medium Risk Reduction - Reducing the number of UmiJS plugins directly minimizes the potential attack surface within the UmiJS framework.
        *   Vulnerability Propagation through UmiJS Plugins: Medium Risk Reduction - Decreases the risk of vulnerabilities in unused plugin code being exploited within the UmiJS application.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   Developers generally aim to use only plugins that are perceived as necessary for core features, but there's no strict policy or regular audit process.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's actual status)
        *   Formal policy enforcing the principle of least privilege for UmiJS plugins.
        *   Regular audits of installed UmiJS plugins to identify and remove any that are no longer essential or underutilized.
