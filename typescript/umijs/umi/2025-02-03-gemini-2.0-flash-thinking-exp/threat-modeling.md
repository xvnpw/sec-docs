# Threat Model Analysis for umijs/umi

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in UmiJS dependencies or their transitive dependencies. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in packages like webpack, babel, react-router-dom, or any other package within the dependency tree. Attackers might leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, code execution on the server or client-side.

**Umi Component Affected:** `node_modules`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` (Dependency Management)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit project dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
* Update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
* Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipelines.
* Use dependency lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependencies](./threats/malicious_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces a compromised or intentionally malicious npm package into the UmiJS project's dependency tree. This could be through typosquatting, account compromise of package maintainers, or direct injection into compromised registries. Once installed, the malicious package can execute arbitrary code during installation or runtime, potentially stealing credentials, injecting backdoors, or modifying application behavior.

**Impact:** Supply chain compromise, backdoors in application, data theft, unauthorized access, code execution.

**Umi Component Affected:** `node_modules`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` (Dependency Management)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review dependencies before adding them to the project.
* Use dependency lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`).
* Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect known malicious packages.
* Monitor dependency updates and security advisories.
* Consider using private npm registries or package mirrors for stricter control.

## Threat: [Build Script Injection](./threats/build_script_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into custom build scripts or UmiJS configuration files that are executed during the build process. This could be achieved by compromising developer machines, exploiting vulnerabilities in CI/CD systems, or through insecure handling of external inputs in build scripts. The injected commands can then be executed with the privileges of the build process, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or modification of the build output.

**Impact:** Compromised build process, malicious code injected into application artifacts, data exfiltration from build environment.

**Umi Component Affected:** `.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts`, custom build scripts (e.g., in `package.json` scripts)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate any external input used in build scripts or configuration files.
* Avoid dynamic command generation based on untrusted sources.
* Implement secure CI/CD practices, including access control and input validation.
* Regularly review and audit build scripts and configuration files for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable UmiJS Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_umijs_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages malicious or vulnerable UmiJS plugins. This could involve using plugins from untrusted sources, plugins with known vulnerabilities, or plugins that are intentionally designed to be malicious.  A malicious plugin could inject code into the application, modify its behavior, or exfiltrate data. Vulnerable plugins could be exploited by attackers to gain control or access sensitive information.

**Impact:** Application compromise, code execution, data theft, unauthorized access, instability.

**Umi Component Affected:** `plugins` configuration in `.umirc.ts` or `config/config.ts`, plugin installation process, plugin runtime execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use plugins from reputable sources and actively maintained projects.
* Review plugin code before installation, especially for plugins from less known sources.
* Regularly update plugins and check for known vulnerabilities.
* Implement plugin dependency scanning and vulnerability audits.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** UmiJS configuration files (e.g., `.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts`) are accidentally exposed in production. These files might contain sensitive information like API keys, internal URLs, database credentials, or other secrets. Attackers who gain access to these files can extract sensitive information and use it to compromise the application or related systems.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, credential theft, potential for full application compromise and access to backend systems.

**Umi Component Affected:** `.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts` (Configuration), deployment process, web server configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper access control and restrict access to configuration files in production environments.
* Avoid committing sensitive information directly into configuration files.
* Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage sensitive configuration.
* Configure web servers to prevent direct access to configuration files.

## Threat: [SSR-Specific XSS Vulnerabilities (If SSR is Enabled)](./threats/ssr-specific_xss_vulnerabilities__if_ssr_is_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are introduced through server-side rendered components. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered on the server, attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the server-rendered content. SSR-based XSS can be more impactful as it might bypass client-side XSS protections and potentially compromise server-side context in some scenarios.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, session hijacking, account compromise, defacement, malware distribution.

**Umi Component Affected:** SSR components, data rendering logic in SSR, server-side rendering process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding in server-side rendered components.
* Use secure templating engines that automatically escape output by default.
* Follow secure coding practices for SSR applications, specifically regarding data handling and rendering.
* Perform XSS testing specifically targeting SSR rendered content.

## Threat: [SSR Injection Attacks (If SSR is Enabled)](./threats/ssr_injection_attacks__if_ssr_is_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Injection attacks target server-side rendering logic. If SSR logic dynamically constructs responses based on user input without proper validation and sanitization, it can be vulnerable to injection attacks like HTML injection or template injection. Attackers can manipulate the server-rendered output to inject arbitrary HTML, scripts, or template commands, potentially leading to XSS, information disclosure, or even server-side code execution in severe cases (template injection).

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting, information disclosure, potential server-side code execution (template injection), defacement.

**Umi Component Affected:** SSR components, data processing logic in SSR, server-side rendering process, templating engine (if used directly).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate and sanitize all user inputs used in SSR logic.
* Use secure templating engines and avoid constructing HTML strings directly from user input.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful injection attacks.
* Regularly audit SSR code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
