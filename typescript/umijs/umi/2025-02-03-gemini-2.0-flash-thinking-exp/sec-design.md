# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - UmiJS is a pluggable enterprise-level react application framework.
  - The primary goal of UmiJS is to provide a comprehensive and efficient framework for building web applications, particularly React-based applications.
  - Key priorities include developer productivity, ease of use, flexibility through plugins, and performance of applications built with UmiJS.
  - UmiJS aims to streamline the development process, reduce boilerplate code, and offer a robust foundation for complex web applications.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the UmiJS framework itself could be inherited by all applications built using it, leading to widespread impact.
  - Supply chain risks associated with dependencies used by UmiJS could introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Improper handling of user-provided configurations or plugins could lead to security issues in applications.
  - Performance bottlenecks or instability in UmiJS could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications built with it.
  - Lack of clear security guidance and best practices for developers using UmiJS could result in insecure applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the UmiJS repository. (Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request review process)
  - security control: Dependency management using `package-lock.json` or similar to ensure consistent dependency versions. (Implemented in: Repository configuration)
  - security control: Regular updates of dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. (Implemented in: Ongoing maintenance of the repository)
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might exist in dependencies that are not yet publicly disclosed or patched.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be introduced by contributors despite code review processes.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications built using UmiJS is ultimately the responsibility of the application developers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the UmiJS codebase.
  - security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in UmiJS dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits of the UmiJS framework to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security documentation and best practices for developers using UmiJS to build secure applications.
  - security control: Establish a process for users to report security vulnerabilities in UmiJS and ensure timely response and remediation.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Applications built with UmiJS will likely need to implement their own authentication mechanisms as UmiJS is a frontend framework and does not handle backend authentication directly.
    - UmiJS should provide guidance and best practices for implementing secure authentication in applications built with it, such as recommendations for secure session management and integration with backend authentication services.
  - Authorization:
    - Similar to authentication, authorization logic will reside within applications built with UmiJS.
    - UmiJS should offer patterns or utilities to help developers implement fine-grained authorization within their applications, potentially through plugin mechanisms or recommended libraries.
  - Input Validation:
    - UmiJS should encourage and facilitate input validation within applications to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.
    - This could involve providing utilities for sanitizing user inputs or integrating with validation libraries.
    - Developers using UmiJS should be educated on the importance of input validation at all application layers.
  - Cryptography:
    - UmiJS itself may not directly implement cryptographic functions, but applications built with it will likely need to use cryptography for secure communication and data storage.
    - UmiJS documentation should recommend secure cryptographic libraries and best practices for developers, especially when handling sensitive data within applications.
    - UmiJS should avoid introducing any cryptographic weaknesses or vulnerabilities in its core functionality.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and distribution of the UmiJS framework.
  - Usage of UmiJS framework by developers to build and deploy web applications.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the UmiJS framework and its documentation.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code of UmiJS: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure of vulnerabilities.
  - NPM packages of UmiJS: High sensitivity. Integrity is critical to ensure users download and use untampered packages. Availability is important for developers to use the framework.
  - Documentation website content: Medium sensitivity. Integrity and availability are important for users to access accurate information.
  - User data in applications built with UmiJS: Sensitivity depends on the application. UmiJS itself does not handle user data, but applications built with it might handle sensitive user data. Security of user data is the responsibility of application developers, but UmiJS should provide guidance and not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise user data in applications.
