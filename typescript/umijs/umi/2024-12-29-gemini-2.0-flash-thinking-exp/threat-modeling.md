*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection via Build Process
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the application by introducing malicious dependencies during the build process. This could involve substituting legitimate dependencies with compromised versions or introducing entirely new malicious packages. The attacker might achieve this by exploiting vulnerabilities in package managers or by compromising developer machines.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution within the application's context, data exfiltration, denial of service, or supply chain compromise affecting users of the application.
    *   **Umi Component Affected:** `UmiJS Build Process`, `package.json`, `node_modules`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize package lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and regularly update dependencies.
        *   Employ dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor and manage open-source dependencies.
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies using checksums or signatures.
        *   Restrict the use of wildcard or range dependencies to minimize the risk of unexpected updates.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerable UmiJS Plugins
    *   **Description:** Attackers could leverage known vulnerabilities in third-party UmiJS plugins to compromise the application. This could involve exploiting security flaws in the plugin's code to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or manipulate data.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to application resources, data breaches, code execution within the application, or denial of service.
    *   **Umi Component Affected:** `UmiJS Plugin System`, specific plugin modules
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit UmiJS plugins before installation.
        *   Keep all plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues in used plugins.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving plugin updates.
        *   Consider developing custom solutions instead of relying on potentially vulnerable plugins for critical functionalities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Configuration Leading to Information Disclosure
    *   **Description:**  Attackers could exploit insecure UmiJS configurations to gain access to sensitive information. This might involve misconfigured environment variables exposing API keys or internal URLs in client-side bundles, or overly permissive configurations allowing access to sensitive development endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including API keys, internal infrastructure details, or user information. This could lead to further attacks on backend systems or data breaches.
    *   **Umi Component Affected:** `UmiJS Configuration System` (`.umirc.ts`, environment variables), `UmiJS Build Process`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration data and avoid hardcoding them in configuration files.
        *   Implement mechanisms to prevent sensitive environment variables from being included in client-side bundles (e.g., using `.env` files and proper build configurations).
        *   Review UmiJS build configurations to ensure no sensitive information is being inadvertently exposed.
        *   Restrict access to development-related endpoints and tools in production environments.

*   **Threat:** Development Server Exposure in Production
    *   **Description:**  An attacker could target an instance where the UmiJS development server is mistakenly deployed or left running in a production environment. The development server typically lacks the security hardening of a production server and might expose sensitive information or allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application server, including access to sensitive data, code execution, and potential takeover of the system.
    *   **Umi Component Affected:** `UmiJS Development Server`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly avoid running the UmiJS development server in production environments.
        *   Implement infrastructure-level controls to prevent access to development ports and services in production.
        *   Use proper deployment pipelines and configurations that ensure only production-ready builds are deployed.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If the UmiJS application utilizes Server-Side Rendering (SSR), attackers could inject malicious code into the rendered HTML if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being included in the server-rendered output. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the application.
    *   **Umi Component Affected:** `UmiJS SSR implementation`, potentially custom server-side rendering logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side before rendering content.
        *   Utilize templating engines that automatically escape HTML by default.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
