## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**1. Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the software supply chain, which includes external dependencies used by the UmiJS application. By compromising these dependencies, attackers can indirectly compromise the application itself.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise UmiJS Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** This node represents the attacker's goal of gaining control over one or more dependencies used by the UmiJS project.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Vulnerable npm Packages [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Critical Node: Vulnerability Identification [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Identification]:**
                *   **Description:** Attackers identify outdated or vulnerable npm packages used in the UmiJS project. This can be done using automated tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or by consulting public vulnerability databases.
                *   **Exploitation:** Publicly available information about vulnerable packages makes identification relatively easy.
            *   **Critical Node: Vulnerability Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Exploitation]:**
                *   **Description:** Once vulnerable packages are identified, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities within them. These vulnerabilities can range from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
                *   **Exploitation:** Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available or easy to develop, making exploitation feasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

**2. Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the build process of the UmiJS application. By compromising the build process, they can inject malicious code or alter the application's behavior during compilation and packaging.
*   **Critical Node: Build Script Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** This node represents the attacker's goal of modifying the build scripts used by the UmiJS project. Build scripts are typically defined in `package.json` and can include custom scripts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Critical Node: Build Script Access [CRITICAL NODE - Build Script Access]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the project's codebase and modify build scripts. This could be achieved through compromised developer accounts, insecure CI/CD pipelines, or vulnerabilities in version control systems.
            *   **Exploitation:** Accessing and modifying build scripts requires some level of access to the development environment or codebase.
        *   **Critical Node: Malicious Code Injection [CRITICAL NODE - Malicious Code Injection]:**
            *   **Description:** Once build scripts are accessible, attackers inject malicious code into them. This code can be designed to execute arbitrary commands during the build process, such as downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or backdooring the application.
            *   **Exploitation:** Injecting malicious code into build scripts allows for persistent compromise and can be difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Development Environment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_development_environment_vulnerabilities.md)

**3. Exploit Development Environment Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH - if dev env is weakly secured]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the development environment, specifically developer machines where the UmiJS development server is running. Compromising a developer machine can provide access to source code, development tools, and potentially the running application.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise Developer Machine [HIGH-RISK PATH - if dev env is weakly secured] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** This node represents the attacker's goal of gaining control over a developer's machine.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Critical Node: Dev Machine Access [CRITICAL NODE - Dev Machine Access]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers use various methods to gain access to a developer's machine. This can include phishing attacks, social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities in the developer's operating system or software, or local network attacks.
            *   **Exploitation:** The likelihood of this path depends heavily on the security practices implemented on developer machines. Weakly secured machines are more vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Environment Vulnerabilities - Exposed Sensitive Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_environment_vulnerabilities_-_exposed_sensitive_configuration.md)

**4. Exploit Configuration and Environment Vulnerabilities - Exposed Sensitive Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target misconfigurations that lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, within the UmiJS application's configuration or environment variables.
*   **Critical Node: Exposed Sensitive Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** This node represents the scenario where sensitive configuration data is unintentionally exposed.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Critical Node: Configuration Access [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Access]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers identify and access configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, configuration files in version control) or environment variables where sensitive information is stored. This can happen due to accidental commits to public repositories, misconfigured server environments, or vulnerabilities in access controls.
            *   **Exploitation:** Identifying and accessing exposed configuration is often straightforward if misconfigurations exist.
        *   **Critical Node: Secret Extraction [CRITICAL NODE - Secret Extraction]:**
            *   **Description:** Once configuration files or environment variables are accessed, attackers extract sensitive information (secrets) contained within them.
            *   **Exploitation:** Extracting secrets from exposed configuration is a trivial step once access is gained.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Environment Vulnerabilities - Misconfigured Security Headers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_environment_vulnerabilities_-_misconfigured_security_headers.md)

**5. Exploit Configuration and Environment Vulnerabilities - Misconfigured Security Headers [HIGH-RISK PATH - Mitigation is relatively easy]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit missing or misconfigured security headers in the UmiJS application's HTTP responses. Security headers are designed to protect against various web application attacks.
*   **Critical Node: Misconfigured Security Headers [HIGH-RISK PATH - Mitigation is relatively easy] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** This node represents the state where the UmiJS application is served with missing or improperly configured security headers.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Critical Node: Header Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE - Header Misconfiguration]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers identify missing or misconfigured security headers (e.g., CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in the application's responses. This can be done using browser developer tools or online header analysis tools.
            *   **Exploitation:** Identifying missing or misconfigured headers is easy using readily available tools.
        *   **Exploitation of Missing/Weak Headers:**  Attackers then exploit the absence or weakness of these headers to perform attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, or Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. While the initial impact of *misconfiguration* is medium, the *potential impact* of successful attacks enabled by missing headers can be high.
