# Threat Model Analysis for umijs/umi

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Build Output](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_build_output.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Build Output
*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information (API keys, secrets, internal configurations) in UmiJS application code or configuration files. The build process then bundles this sensitive data into the client-side application, making it accessible to anyone inspecting the application's source code in the browser. Attackers can extract these secrets from the client-side code and use them to gain unauthorized access to backend systems or sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Exposure of API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets leading to immediate compromise of backend systems and data.
    *   **High:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and potential for significant financial or reputational damage.
*   **Affected UmiJS Component:** Configuration (`.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts`), Build Output (JavaScript bundles, static assets)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize environment variables to manage sensitive configuration data instead of hardcoding them in configuration files or code.
    *   Avoid committing configuration files containing secrets to version control.
    *   Implement secure secret management practices, such as using dedicated secret management tools or environment variable injection at runtime.
    *   Ensure build processes are configured to prevent inclusion of sensitive files or data in client-side bundles.
    *   Regularly scan build outputs for accidentally exposed secrets using automated tools.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of UmiJS Security Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_umijs_security_settings.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of UmiJS Security Settings
*   **Description:** Developers misconfigure UmiJS settings related to security, such as security headers or routing configurations, leading to security weaknesses. For example, disabling default security headers or improperly configuring routing rules can expose the application to attacks. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, or bypass access controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Introduction of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
    *   **High:** Clickjacking vulnerabilities enabling attackers to trick users into performing unintended actions.
    *   **High:** Bypassing access controls due to misconfigured routing, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive application areas or data.
*   **Affected UmiJS Component:** Configuration (`.umirc.ts`, `config/config.ts`), Routing, Request Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand UmiJS configuration options, especially those related to security headers, routing, and middleware.
    *   Follow security best practices and guidelines when configuring UmiJS applications.
    *   Utilize security linters and static analysis tools to identify potential misconfigurations in UmiJS configuration files.
    *   Implement automated security testing to verify that security configurations are correctly applied and effective.
    *   Leverage UmiJS's built-in security features and plugins to enforce security best practices.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in UmiJS Plugin](./threats/vulnerability_in_umijs_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability in UmiJS Plugin
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities within UmiJS plugins, whether official or community-developed. Plugins, especially those less actively maintained or from untrusted sources, can contain security flaws. Exploiting a vulnerable plugin can allow attackers to inject malicious code, gain unauthorized access, or compromise application functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Introduction of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities through malicious plugin code.
    *   **High:** Insecure data handling within plugins leading to data breaches or information disclosure.
    *   **Critical:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a plugin vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution on the server or client-side.
*   **Affected UmiJS Component:** Plugins (`plugins` directory, `package.json` dependencies), Plugin API
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise caution when selecting and using UmiJS plugins, especially community-developed ones.
    *   Prioritize official or well-maintained plugins from trusted sources with active communities and security records.
    *   Thoroughly evaluate and audit plugins before integrating them into the application, reviewing their code and dependencies.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security testing and code reviews specifically targeting plugin functionality and integrations.

## Threat: [Insecure Development Practices Specific to UmiJS](./threats/insecure_development_practices_specific_to_umijs.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Development Practices Specific to UmiJS
*   **Description:** Developers, lacking sufficient security awareness within the UmiJS context, might introduce vulnerabilities by misusing UmiJS features or neglecting secure coding practices specific to the framework. This can include improper handling of user input in UmiJS components, insecure routing logic, or vulnerabilities in custom UmiJS middleware. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform injection attacks, bypass security controls, or compromise application logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Introduction of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper input sanitization in UmiJS components.
    *   **High:** Injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection if backend interactions are involved) due to insecure data handling in UmiJS data fetching or API calls.
    *   **High:** Business logic vulnerabilities arising from insecure routing or middleware implementations within UmiJS.
*   **Affected UmiJS Component:** Components, Routes, Data Fetching mechanisms, Custom middleware, Custom code within UmiJS application
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Provide comprehensive security training to development teams focusing on secure coding practices within the UmiJS framework and React ecosystem.
    *   Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines specific to React and JavaScript development within the UmiJS context.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews with a security focus to identify and address potential vulnerabilities introduced during development.
    *   Utilize linters and static analysis tools configured to detect common security flaws in JavaScript and React code within UmiJS projects.
    *   Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) and penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities in the deployed UmiJS application.
