# Attack Surface Analysis for umijs/umi

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable UmiJS Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_umijs_plugins.md)

*   **Description**: Security flaws or malicious code present in third-party UmiJS plugins installed by the application developers.
*   **How Umi Contributes to the Attack Surface**: UmiJS's plugin architecture encourages extending functionality through plugins. If not vetted, these plugins can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code that runs within the application's context.
*   **Example**: A poorly written plugin might not sanitize user input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within components rendered by that plugin. A malicious plugin could exfiltrate data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact**: Can range from XSS and data breaches to complete compromise of the application, depending on the plugin's capabilities and vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity**: High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Carefully review the plugin's code and documentation before installation.
    *   Be cautious about the permissions and capabilities requested by the plugin.
    *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
    *   Consider implementing a plugin review process within the development team.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Development Server in Production](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_development_server_in_production.md)

*   **Description**: The development server provided by UmiJS is inadvertently exposed in a production environment.
*   **How Umi Contributes to the Attack Surface**: UmiJS provides a convenient development server with features like hot reloading and detailed error messages. This server is not intended for production use and often lacks security hardening.
*   **Example**: A developer forgets to disable the development server or configures port forwarding incorrectly, making the development server accessible on the production domain. Attackers could access development routes, environment variables, or even execute arbitrary code if vulnerabilities exist in the development server itself.
*   **Impact**: Information disclosure, access to internal development tools and configurations, potential for remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Ensure the UmiJS development server is **never** used in production environments.
    *   Use a dedicated production-ready web server like Nginx or Apache.
    *   Implement proper network configurations and firewalls to prevent access to development ports in production.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Source Maps in Production](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_source_maps_in_production.md)

*   **Description**: Source maps, generated during the build process to aid debugging, are accidentally deployed to the production environment.
*   **How Umi Contributes to the Attack Surface**: UmiJS, like many modern JavaScript frameworks, generates source maps by default or with simple configuration. If not handled correctly, these maps can be included in the production build output.
*   **Example**: An attacker can access the source maps of the production application, revealing the original source code, including business logic, API keys (if embedded), and potentially vulnerable code patterns.
*   **Impact**: Reverse engineering of the application, identification of vulnerabilities, exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Configure the UmiJS build process to explicitly **disable** source map generation for production builds.
    *   Verify that source maps are not included in the final deployment artifacts.
    *   If source maps are needed for production debugging (with extreme caution), restrict access to them through server configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (if using SSR)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__if_using_ssr_.md)

*   **Description**: Security flaws arising from rendering the application on the server-side, particularly when handling user-provided data.
*   **How Umi Contributes to the Attack Surface**: UmiJS supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR). If not implemented carefully, especially when interpolating user input into the rendered HTML, it can introduce server-side XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example**: User input provided through a query parameter is directly embedded into the HTML rendered on the server without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.
*   **Impact**: Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Sanitize and escape all user-provided data before rendering it on the server-side.
    *   Utilize templating engines with built-in security features that automatically escape output.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
