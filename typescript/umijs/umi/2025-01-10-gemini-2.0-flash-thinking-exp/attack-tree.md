## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a Known Vulnerability in a Public Plugin (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_known_vulnerability_in_a_public_plugin__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in commonly used Umi.js plugins.
        * This is a high-risk path because known exploits are often readily available, requiring less effort and skill.
        * Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts depending on the plugin's functionality, including code execution or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information through Incorrect Configuration (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_through_incorrect_configuration__critical_node_.md)

* This path highlights the risk of unintentionally revealing sensitive data due to misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Environment Variables Containing Secrets (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_environment_variables_containing_secrets__critical_node_.md)

*  A critical vulnerability where sensitive information like API keys or database credentials are exposed in client-side code or easily accessible configuration.
            * This is a high-risk path due to the ease of exploitation and the severe impact of leaked credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code During the Build (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_the_build__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers aim to inject malicious code into the application during the build process, affecting all subsequent deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Dependencies (Indirectly through npm packages) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_dependencies__indirectly_through_npm_packages___critical_node_.md)

* A critical supply chain attack vector where attackers compromise dependencies used during the build.
            * This is a high-risk path due to the potential for widespread impact and the difficulty of detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information in Build Artifacts (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_in_build_artifacts__critical_node_.md)

*  This path focuses on the risk of inadvertently including sensitive information in the final application build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Include Private Keys or Credentials in the Built Application (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/include_private_keys_or_credentials_in_the_built_application__critical_node_.md)

* A critical error where private keys or credentials are directly embedded in the application code.
            * This is a high-risk path due to the potential for complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Code Execution on the Server (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_code_execution_on_the_server__critical_node_.md)

*  If SSR is enabled, attackers can inject malicious client-side code that gets executed on the server during the rendering process.
        * This is a high-risk path because it can lead to server compromise and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Route Guards or Access Controls (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_route_guards_or_access_controls__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers exploit weaknesses in Umi.js's routing implementation to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        * This is a high-risk path as it directly leads to unauthorized access to protected parts of the application.
