# Threat Model Analysis for umijs/umi

## Threat: [Malicious UmiJS Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_umijs_plugin_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick a developer into installing a malicious UmiJS plugin. This plugin, designed to exploit UmiJS's plugin system, could execute arbitrary code during the build process or at runtime, potentially stealing sensitive data, injecting malicious scripts, or compromising the application's integrity.

**Impact:** Backdoor access to the application, data theft, injection of malware into user browsers, compromised build artifacts leading to supply chain attacks.

**Affected UmiJS Component:** Plugin system, `plugins` configuration in `.umirc.ts` or `config/config.ts`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Only install UmiJS plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources.
- Thoroughly vet and audit the code of any third-party plugins before installation. Pay close attention to permissions requested and any network activity.
- Be extremely cautious of plugins with very few users, no recent updates, or suspicious activity reported.
- Implement a code review process for all changes to plugin configurations.
- Consider using a dependency management tool with security scanning capabilities that can analyze plugin dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Build Configuration Leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/insecure_build_configuration_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** A developer might misconfigure UmiJS's build process, unintentionally including sensitive information in the production build artifacts. This could involve leaving source maps enabled in production, embedding API keys or secrets within the client-side bundle, or exposing internal file paths. Attackers could analyze these artifacts to gain insights into the application's logic, backend infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities, or directly extract exposed secrets.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive source code and configuration details, easier identification of vulnerabilities for exploitation, potential compromise of API keys leading to unauthorized access to external services.

**Affected UmiJS Component:** Build process, `config/config.ts` (specifically build-related options like `devtool`), output directory structure.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure the `devtool` option in `config/config.ts` is set to a production-appropriate value (e.g., `false` or a value that minimizes information exposure) for production builds.
- Never embed sensitive API keys or secrets directly in the client-side code or configuration files. Utilize environment variables or secure vault mechanisms for managing secrets.
- Carefully review the generated build output to confirm that no sensitive information is inadvertently included.
- Implement server-side configurations to prevent direct access to the build output directory.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Misconfiguration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-side_rendering__ssr__misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** When using UmiJS's Server-Side Rendering (SSR) feature, improper handling or lack of sanitization of user-provided data within server-side components can introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are rendered on the server and then executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive user data, defacement of the application, propagation of malware.

**Affected UmiJS Component:** SSR functionality, server-side rendering logic within UmiJS components.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Rigorously sanitize and escape all user-provided data before rendering it on the server-side within UmiJS components.
- Utilize secure templating practices and avoid directly injecting raw HTML strings.
- Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
- Regularly review and update dependencies related to SSR to patch any known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via SSR Data Fetching](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_ssr_data_fetching.md)

**Description:** If the UmiJS SSR implementation involves fetching data from external resources based on user input or application logic, vulnerabilities can arise allowing an attacker to manipulate these requests. By crafting malicious requests, an attacker could force the server to make requests to unintended internal resources or external systems, potentially exposing sensitive information or abusing internal services.

**Impact:** Access to internal network resources that should not be publicly accessible, potential data breaches from internal systems, abuse of external services leading to financial or reputational damage.

**Affected UmiJS Component:** SSR data fetching logic implemented within UmiJS components or API routes used in conjunction with SSR.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided input that influences server-side data fetching URLs or parameters.
- Utilize allow lists (whitelists) for permitted destination hosts or URLs for SSR data fetching.
- Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs for server-side requests. Use safe URL construction methods.
- Consider using a dedicated service or proxy with restricted permissions for making external requests from the server.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a successful SSRF attack.
