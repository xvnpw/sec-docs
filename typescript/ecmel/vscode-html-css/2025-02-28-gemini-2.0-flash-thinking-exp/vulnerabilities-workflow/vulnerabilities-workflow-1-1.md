### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Stylesheet Fetching - Server-Side Request Forgery and Information Disclosure
- Description: The VSCode extension allows users to specify remote stylesheets via the `css.styleSheets` setting. When processing these settings, the extension fetches content from the provided URLs without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by convincing a user to configure a malicious URL in their workspace settings. This could be achieved through social engineering, or by compromising a shared workspace configuration. When VSCode loads a document in the workspace, the extension will attempt to fetch stylesheets from these URLs. If a malicious URL is configured, the VSCode instance will make a request to the attacker-controlled server.
- Impact:
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can cause the VSCode instance to make requests to internal network resources that are not directly accessible from the attacker's machine. This can be used to probe internal services, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure from internal systems.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can observe the requests made by the VSCode instance to their server. This can reveal information about the user's environment, such as their IP address, VSCode version, and potentially other headers sent with the request.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension directly uses the provided URLs in the `css.styleSheets` setting to fetch remote content without any validation or restrictions.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation to ensure that URLs in `css.styleSheets` are safe. This could include:
        - Restricting URL protocols to `http` and `https` only.
        - Implementing a safelist of allowed domains or a denylist of disallowed domains.
        - Validating the URL format to prevent injection of malicious characters.
    - **User Warning:** Display a warning message to the user when they configure remote stylesheets, especially if the URL is not from a trusted domain. Educate users about the risks of adding untrusted remote stylesheets.
- Preconditions:
    1. The user has the "vscode-html-css" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    2. The user configures the `css.styleSheets` setting in their workspace or user settings to include a malicious URL controlled by the attacker. This could happen if:
        - The attacker has write access to the user's workspace settings (e.g., in a shared repository).
        - The user is tricked into manually adding a malicious URL to their settings.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/settings.ts:getStyleSheets()`**: This function retrieves the `css.styleSheets` configuration from the workspace settings.
    ```typescript
    export function getStyleSheets(scope: TextDocument): string[] {
      // ...
      return workspace
        .getConfiguration("css", scope)
        .get<string[]>("styleSheets", [])
        // ...
    }
    ```
    2. **`src/provider.ts:getStyles()`**: This function iterates through the stylesheets obtained from `getStyleSheets()`. It checks if a stylesheet is remote using `this.isRemote.test(glob)`.
    ```typescript
    private async getStyles(document: TextDocument) {
      // ...
      const globs = getStyleSheets(document);

      for (const glob of globs) {
        if (this.isRemote.test(glob)) { // Check if remote URL
          styles.set(glob, await this.getRemote(glob)); // Fetch remote stylesheet
        } else if (folder) {
          // ... local file handling ...
        }
      }
      // ...
      return styles;
    }
    ```
    3. **`src/provider.ts:getRemote()`**: This function fetches the content of a remote stylesheet using the `fetch` API. The URL is directly taken from the `glob` variable, which originates from the user-configured `css.styleSheets` setting, without any validation.
    ```typescript
    private async getRemote(name: string) {
      let styles = cache.get(name);
      if (!styles) {
        const content = await this.fetch(name); // Fetch content from URL
        styles = parse(content);
        cache.set(name, styles);
      }
      return styles;
    }
    ```
    4. **`src/provider.ts:fetch()`**: This is where the actual HTTP request is made using the `fetch` API.
    ```typescript
    private async fetch(url: string) {
      try {
        const res = await fetch(url); // Make HTTP request to the provided URL
        if (res.ok) {
          return res.text();
        }
        throw new Error(res.statusText);
      } catch (error) {
        window.showErrorMessage(`Fetching ${url} failed. ${error}`);
      }
      return "";
    }
    ```
    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Settings (css.styleSheets)] --> B(getStyleSheets);
        B --> C(getStyles);
        C -- Remote URL --> D(getRemote);
        D --> E(fetch);
        E -- HTTP Request --> F[Attacker Server/Internal Resource];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** Start a simple HTTP server on your local machine to simulate an attacker server. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server: `python -m http.server 8000`. This will serve files from the current directory on `http://localhost:8000`.
    2. **Configure Malicious URL in VSCode Settings:**
        - Open VSCode and go to your workspace settings (or user settings if you want to test globally).
        - Edit the `settings.json` file (create one in `.vscode` folder in your workspace if it doesn't exist).
        - Add the following configuration to `settings.json`, replacing `"http://localhost:8000"` with the address of your attacker server:
        ```json
        {
          "css.styleSheets": [
            "http://localhost:8000/malicious.css"
          ]
        }
        ```
        - You can create an empty file named `malicious.css` in the directory where you started your Python HTTP server, although it's not strictly necessary to observe the request.
    3. **Open HTML File in VSCode:** Open any HTML file in the VSCode workspace where you configured the malicious URL. If you don't have one, create a new file named `test.html` and open it.
    4. **Observe Server Logs:** Check the console output of your Python HTTP server. You should see a log entry indicating that VSCode has made a request to `GET /malicious.css` from your machine. This confirms that the extension is fetching content from the attacker-specified URL.

This test case demonstrates that the extension fetches remote stylesheets from URLs provided in the settings without validation, confirming the SSRF and Information Disclosure vulnerability.
