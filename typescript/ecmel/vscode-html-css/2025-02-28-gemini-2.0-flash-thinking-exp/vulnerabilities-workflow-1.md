### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Remote Stylesheet Fetching - Server-Side Request Forgery and Information Disclosure

- **Vulnerability Name**: Remote Stylesheet Fetching - Server-Side Request Forgery and Information Disclosure
- **Description**:
    1. An attacker can configure the `css.styleSheets` setting in the VS Code workspace settings.
    2. The attacker provides a malicious URL as a value in the `css.styleSheets` array. This URL can point to an internal service, a requestbin for exfiltration, or a slow endpoint. This could be achieved by convincing a user to configure a malicious URL in their workspace settings through social engineering, or by compromising a shared workspace configuration.
    3. When the "vscode-html-css" extension is activated (e.g., upon opening a relevant file like an HTML file), the `Provider.getStyles` function is triggered.
    4. `getStyles` iterates through the configured `css.styleSheets`. For each entry, it checks if it's a remote URL using `this.isRemote.test(glob)`.
    5. If identified as a remote URL, the `getRemote` function is called with the malicious URL.
    6. `getRemote` function uses the `fetch(url)` API to make an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL without any validation or sanitization.
    7. The VS Code extension, acting as a client, initiates an HTTP request to the specified malicious URL.
    8. If the malicious URL points to an internal service within the network where VS Code is running, the attacker can potentially access and interact with that internal service.
    9. If the malicious URL points to a service like RequestBin, the attacker can capture and inspect the details of the HTTP request originating from the VS Code environment. This may reveal sensitive information about the user's environment or workspace.
- **Impact**:
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can cause the VSCode instance to make requests to internal network resources that are not directly accessible from the attacker's machine. This can be used to probe internal services, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure from internal systems.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can observe the requests made by the VSCode instance to their server. This can reveal information about the user's environment, such as their IP address, VSCode version, and potentially other headers sent with the request. An attacker might also gain access to sensitive information from internal services or the VS Code environment by observing the responses from the malicious URL or by capturing request details.
    - **Internal Network Access:** An attacker could potentially interact with internal network resources that are accessible from the VS Code environment, potentially leading to further unauthorized actions depending on the nature of the internal services.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The extension directly uses the provided URLs in the `css.styleSheets` setting to fetch remote content without any validation or restrictions. The extension directly fetches URLs provided in the `css.styleSheets` setting without any validation or security measures.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation to ensure that URLs in `css.styleSheets` are safe. This could include:
        - Restricting URL protocols to `http` and `https` only.
        - Implementing a safelist of allowed domains or a denylist of disallowed domains.
        - Validating the URL format to prevent injection of malicious characters.
    - **User Warning:** Display a warning message to the user when they configure remote stylesheets, especially if the URL is not from a trusted domain. Educate users about the risks of adding untrusted remote stylesheets. Introduce a user confirmation or warning mechanism before fetching remote stylesheets, especially if the URL is not from a trusted domain, to ensure users are aware of potential risks.
    - **URL scheme restriction**: Implement URL scheme restriction to only allow `https` URLs, or a whitelist of allowed schemes.
    - **Hostname/IP blocklist**: Implement a blocklist for specific hostnames or IP ranges, especially to prevent access to private IP ranges or known malicious hosts.
- **Preconditions**:
    1. The user has the "vscode-html-css" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    2. A user must open a workspace in VS Code.
    3. The user configures the `css.styleSheets` setting in their workspace or user settings to include a malicious URL controlled by the attacker. This could happen if:
        - The attacker has write access to the user's workspace settings (e.g., in a shared repository).
        - The user is tricked into manually adding a malicious URL to their settings.
    4. The extension needs to be triggered to activate, typically by opening a file type that the extension processes (e.g., HTML, or any language enabled in `css.enabledLanguages`).
- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **`src/settings.ts:getStyleSheets()`**: This function retrieves the `css.styleSheets` configuration from the workspace settings.
    ```typescript
    export function getStyleSheets(scope: TextDocument): string[] {
      // ...
      return workspace
        .getConfiguration("css", scope)
        .get<string[]>("styleSheets", [])
        // ...
    }
    ```
    2. **`src/provider.ts:getStyles()`**: This function iterates through the stylesheets obtained from `getStyleSheets()`. It checks if a stylesheet is remote using `this.isRemote.test(glob)`.
    ```typescript
    private async getStyles(document: TextDocument) {
      // ...
      const globs = getStyleSheets(document);

      for (const glob of globs) {
        if (this.isRemote.test(glob)) { // Check if remote URL
          styles.set(glob, await this.getRemote(glob)); // Fetch remote stylesheet
        } else if (folder) {
          // ... local file handling ...
        }
      }
      // ...
      return styles;
    }
    ```
    3. **`src/provider.ts:getRemote()`**: This function fetches the content of a remote stylesheet using the `fetch` API. The URL is directly taken from the `glob` variable, which originates from the user-configured `css.styleSheets` setting, without any validation.
    ```typescript
    private async getRemote(name: string) {
      let styles = cache.get(name);
      if (!styles) {
        const content = await this.fetch(name); // Fetch content from URL
        styles = parse(content);
        cache.set(name, styles);
      }
      return styles;
    }
    ```
    4. **`src/provider.ts:fetch()`**: This is where the actual HTTP request is made using the `fetch` API.
    ```typescript
    private async fetch(url: string) {
      try {
        const res = await fetch(url); // Make HTTP request to the provided URL, No URL validation here
        if (res.ok) {
          return res.text();
        }
        throw new Error(res.statusText);
      } catch (error) {
        window.showErrorMessage(`Fetching ${url} failed. ${error}`);
      }
      return "";
    }
    ```
    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Settings (css.styleSheets)] --> B(getStyleSheets);
        B --> C(getStyles);
        C -- Remote URL --> D(getRemote);
        D --> E(fetch);
        E -- HTTP Request --> F[Attacker Server/Internal Resource];
    ```

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server (Option 1: Local HTTP Server):** Start a simple HTTP server on your local machine to simulate an attacker server. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server: `python -m http.server 8000`. This will serve files from the current directory on `http://localhost:8000`.
    2. **Setup Attacker Server (Option 2: RequestBin):** Use a service like RequestBin (e.g., from https://requestbin.com/ or a self-hosted alternative) to capture and inspect HTTP requests. Obtain a unique RequestBin URL.
    3. **Configure Malicious URL in VSCode Settings:**
        - Open VSCode and go to your workspace settings (or user settings if you want to test globally).
        - Edit the `settings.json` file (create one in `.vscode` folder in your workspace if it doesn't exist).
        - Add the following configuration to `settings.json`, choose either your local server URL or RequestBin URL:
        ```json
        {
          "css.styleSheets": [
            "http://localhost:8000/malicious.css" // Option 1: Local Server
            // "YOUR_REQUESTBIN_URL"             // Option 2: RequestBin (replace with your URL)
          ]
        }
        ```
        - If using Option 1, you can create an empty file named `malicious.css` in the directory where you started your Python HTTP server, although it's not strictly necessary to observe the request.
    4. **Open HTML File in VSCode:** Open any HTML file in the VSCode workspace where you configured the malicious URL. If you don't have one, create a new file named `test.html` and open it.
    5. **Observe Server Logs:**
        - **Option 1 (Local Server):** Check the console output of your Python HTTP server. You should see a log entry indicating that VSCode has made a request to `GET /malicious.css` from your machine. This confirms that the extension is fetching content from the attacker-specified URL.
        - **Option 2 (RequestBin):** Navigate to your RequestBin URL in a web browser. Inspect the captured requests in RequestBin. You should observe an HTTP request originating from the VS Code environment to the URL you configured in `css.styleSheets`. The request details (headers, IP address, etc.) can confirm the SSRF vulnerability and may reveal information about the VS Code environment.

This test case demonstrates that the extension fetches remote stylesheets from URLs provided in the settings without validation, confirming the SSRF and Information Disclosure vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 2: Potential Path Traversal via Workspace Configuration and Filename Manipulation

- **Vulnerability Name**: Path Traversal via Workspace Configuration and Filename Manipulation
- **Description**:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VS Code workspace.
    2. Within the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` file, the attacker configures the `css.styleSheets` setting to include path traversal sequences combined with variable substitution. For example:
       ```json
       {
         "css.styleSheets": ["../**/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css"]
       }
       ```
    3. The attacker includes a file with a specially crafted filename within the workspace. This filename is designed to exploit path traversal when variable substitution occurs, for example: `src/../../../../etc/passwd.html`.
    4. When a user opens this malicious workspace and the crafted file in VS Code, the CSS Intellisense extension is activated.
    5. The `getStyleSheets` function in `src/settings.ts` processes the workspace configuration and performs variable substitution. In this case, `${fileBasenameNoExtension}` is replaced with `src/../../../../etc/passwd` extracted from the opened filename.
    6. This substituted value is incorporated into the glob pattern, resulting in a potentially malicious glob like `../**/src/../../../../etc/passwd.css`.
    7. The extension then utilizes `workspace.findFiles` in `src/provider.ts` with a `RelativePattern` based on this crafted glob pattern and the workspace root.
    8. While VS Code's `workspace.findFiles` is intended to be workspace-scoped, there's a potential vulnerability if the crafted glob pattern, after variable substitution, can bypass these restrictions or lead to unexpected file access attempts within or potentially outside the intended workspace.
    9. If `workspace.findFiles` locates a file (even inadvertently within the workspace due to flawed path resolution from the crafted pattern), the extension proceeds to read its content using `workspace.fs.readFile` in `src/provider.ts`.
- **Impact**: If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read files within or potentially outside the intended workspace scope, leading to information disclosure. Even if full path traversal outside the workspace is prevented by VS Code's security measures, the vulnerability may still cause unexpected file access within the workspace or lead to errors and potentially unexpected behavior of the extension.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None in the extension's code explicitly sanitize or validate the `css.styleSheets` settings or filenames to prevent path traversal. The security relies on the workspace-scoping enforced by VS Code's `workspace.findFiles` and `workspace.fs.readFile` APIs.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `css.styleSheets` setting in `src/settings.ts`, especially when handling variable substitutions. This should include checks to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) in the configured paths.
    - Sanitize the filename components obtained from `scope.fileName` in `src/settings.ts` before performing variable substitution to remove or neutralize any path traversal elements.
    - Implement stricter path validation and sanitization within `src/provider.ts` before using paths in `workspace.findFiles` and `workspace.fs.readFile` calls. Ensure that resolved paths are strictly within the intended workspace boundaries.
    - Consider using more secure path manipulation and resolution APIs that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions**:
    - A user opens a malicious VS Code workspace provided by an attacker.
    - The malicious workspace contains a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file with path traversal sequences in the `css.styleSheets` setting.
    - The malicious workspace includes a file with a crafted filename designed to exploit path traversal through variable substitution.
    - The CSS Intellisense extension is activated in VS Code for the opened workspace and file.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - `/code/src/settings.ts:getStyleSheets`: This function retrieves the `css.styleSheets` configuration and performs variable substitution on the paths using filename components. It lacks input validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal. The substituted paths are directly used in glob patterns.
    - `/code/src/provider.ts:getStyles`: This function uses the glob patterns from `getStyleSheets` and `workspace.findFiles` with `RelativePattern` to discover stylesheet files. It then uses `workspace.fs.readFile` in `getLocal` to read the content of these files. The security relies on the assumption that `workspace.findFiles` and `workspace.fs.readFile` are inherently workspace-scoped and prevent access outside the workspace, which might be bypassed with crafted inputs.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. Create a new, empty folder to serve as the malicious workspace root.
    2. Inside this folder, create a `.vscode` subfolder.
    3. Within `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "css.styleSheets": ["../**/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css"]
       }
       ```
    4. Inside the workspace root, create a folder named `src`.
    5. Within the `src` folder, create a file named `../../../../etc/passwd.html` (This creates a file path that, when `${fileBasenameNoExtension}` is substituted, is intended to traverse up and attempt to access `/etc/passwd`). The actual file created will be within your workspace, but the filename is crafted to test path traversal logic.
    6. Open this workspace folder in VS Code.
    7. Open the file `src/../../../../etc/passwd.html` in the editor.
    8. Activate the CSS Intellisense extension if it's not already active.
    9. Monitor the file system access of the VS Code process or the extension (using system tools like `lsof` on Linux or Process Monitor on Windows).
    10. Observe if the extension attempts to access files outside the workspace directory, specifically looking for attempts to access `/etc/passwd` or similar sensitive files based on the crafted path.
    11. Alternatively, check for error messages in the VS Code developer console (`Help` -> `Toggle Developer Tools`) that might indicate failed file access attempts outside the workspace or unusual path resolution behavior.

    **Expected outcome (Vulnerable case):** If the extension is vulnerable, you might observe attempts to access files outside the workspace based on the crafted path, or errors indicating issues with path resolution related to the traversal attempt.

    **Expected outcome (Mitigated case):** If VS Code and the extension's path handling are secure, you should not observe any attempts to access files outside the workspace, and the extension should either function normally within the workspace scope or handle the crafted path gracefully without attempting to traverse outside the workspace.
