## Vulnerability List for Vue VSCode Snippets

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified in the Vue VSCode Snippets extension itself. The extension's code is limited to registering a simple command that displays a message and it primarily functions by providing static code snippets.

It's important to note that while the extension itself appears to be secure based on the provided files, the *use* of code snippets, in general, can introduce vulnerabilities if developers blindly copy and paste snippets without understanding their implications. However, such vulnerabilities would stem from developer practices and not from the extension's code itself, which is explicitly excluded as per the instructions.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided files, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria of being introduced by the project, exploitable by an external attacker, and of high rank or above.

**Conclusion:**

No high-rank vulnerabilities found.
