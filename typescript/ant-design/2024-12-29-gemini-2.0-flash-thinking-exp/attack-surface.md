Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Ant Design, focusing on high and critical severity:

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through unsanitized component properties.
    *   **How Ant Design Contributes:** Certain Ant Design components accept properties that render HTML or Markdown. If user-provided data is directly passed to these properties without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** Using the `title` property of a `Tooltip` component to display user-generated text that contains a `<script>` tag.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Always sanitize user-provided data before passing it to Ant Design component properties that render HTML or Markdown. Use appropriate escaping functions or libraries.
        *   **Developer:**  Prefer using plain text properties or explicitly designed secure rendering mechanisms provided by Ant Design components where available.

*   **Description:** DOM-Based XSS through manipulation of Ant Design's rendered elements.
    *   **How Ant Design Contributes:** Ant Design components manipulate the DOM to render UI elements. If application-specific JavaScript directly manipulates these rendered elements without proper care, it can introduce DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  Using `innerHTML` to modify a div element rendered by an Ant Design `Card` component with unsanitized user input.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, similar to reflected or stored XSS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid direct DOM manipulation of elements rendered by Ant Design. Rely on Ant Design's component APIs and state management for updates.
        *   **Developer:** If DOM manipulation is necessary, ensure all user-provided data is thoroughly sanitized before being inserted into the DOM.
