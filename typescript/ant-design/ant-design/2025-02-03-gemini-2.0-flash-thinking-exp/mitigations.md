## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Ant Design Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_ant_design_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Ant Design Releases:**  Actively track new releases of the `antd` package on npm, GitHub, or the official Ant Design website. Subscribe to release notifications if available.
    2.  **Review Ant Design Changelogs:** When a new version is released, carefully examine the changelog and release notes provided by the Ant Design team. Look for mentions of bug fixes, security patches, and vulnerability resolutions.
    3.  **Update `antd` Package:** Use your package manager (npm or yarn) to update the `antd` dependency in your project to the latest stable version.  Run commands like `npm update antd` or `yarn upgrade antd`.
    4.  **Regression Testing:** After updating, perform thorough regression testing of your application's user interface, focusing on areas that utilize Ant Design components. Ensure the update hasn't introduced any breaking changes or unexpected behavior in your application's UI.
    5.  **Stay within Supported Versions:**  Use actively supported versions of Ant Design.  Older, unsupported versions are less likely to receive security patches.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Ant Design (High Severity):** Outdated versions of Ant Design may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Severity is high because these are known weaknesses with potential exploits.
        *   **Unpatched Bugs in Ant Design (Medium Severity):**  Older versions may contain bugs that, while not explicitly security vulnerabilities, could be leveraged in unintended ways or lead to denial-of-service or unexpected behavior. Severity is medium as the exploitability might be less direct but still impactful.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Ant Design:** Significantly reduces risk. Updating directly patches known security flaws within the library itself.
        *   **Unpatched Bugs in Ant Design:** Moderately reduces risk.  Increases stability and reduces the likelihood of encountering unexpected issues that could have security implications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of updating dependencies, but a consistent, scheduled process specifically for Ant Design updates might be missing. Updates might be reactive rather than proactive.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Scheduled Ant Design Updates:** Implement a regular schedule (e.g., monthly) to check for and apply updates to the Ant Design library.
        *   **Automated Update Notifications:** Set up automated notifications or alerts for new Ant Design releases to prompt timely updates.
        *   **Documented Update Procedure:** Create a documented procedure for updating Ant Design, including testing steps and rollback strategies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning for Ant Design and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_for_ant_design_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Select a Dependency Scanner:** Choose a dependency scanning tool that can analyze npm or yarn projects and identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. Examples include Snyk, npm audit, yarn audit, or GitHub Dependency Scanning.
    2.  **Configure Scanner for Project:** Integrate the chosen scanner into your development workflow or CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to specifically scan the `antd` package and all of its transitive dependencies.
    3.  **Run Scans Regularly:** Run dependency scans regularly, ideally on every build or commit, to detect newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Ant Design or its dependency chain.
    4.  **Review Scan Results for Ant Design Issues:**  When scan results are available, prioritize reviewing findings related to `antd` and its direct and indirect dependencies.
    5.  **Remediate Ant Design Vulnerabilities:** If vulnerabilities are found in Ant Design or its dependencies, follow the scanner's recommendations to remediate them. This might involve updating Ant Design, updating specific dependencies, or applying workarounds if updates are not immediately available.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Ant Design's Dependencies (High Severity):** Ant Design relies on other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect your application through Ant Design. Severity is high as these are known vulnerabilities in the libraries Ant Design relies on.
        *   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in dependencies of Ant Design's dependencies (transitive dependencies) can also pose a risk. Dependency scanning helps identify these less obvious vulnerabilities. Severity ranges from medium to high depending on the vulnerability and its exploitability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Ant Design's Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk. Proactively identifies vulnerabilities in the libraries Ant Design depends on.
        *   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Extends vulnerability detection to the entire dependency tree, including less obvious transitive dependencies.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented.  Basic checks like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` might be used occasionally, but a dedicated, integrated dependency scanning solution focused on continuous monitoring for Ant Design and its dependencies is likely missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Integrated Dependency Scanning Tool:** Implement a dedicated dependency scanning tool integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in `antd` and its dependencies on every build.
        *   **Ant Design Focused Reporting:** Configure the scanning tool to provide clear reports specifically highlighting vulnerabilities related to `antd` and its dependency tree.
        *   **Automated Alerts for Ant Design Issues:** Set up automated alerts to notify the development team immediately when vulnerabilities are detected in Ant Design or its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Integrity of Ant Design Packages](./mitigation_strategies/verify_integrity_of_ant_design_packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Package Manager Checksums (Default):** Ensure you are using a modern package manager (npm or yarn) that automatically verifies package integrity using checksums during installation. This is a default feature in recent versions.
    2.  **Maintain Package Lock Files:**  Consistently use and commit package lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to your project repository. Lock files ensure that the exact versions and checksums of Ant Design and its dependencies are consistently used across environments.
    3.  **Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN (If Applicable):** If you load Ant Design or related assets from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), implement Subresource Integrity (SRI). Generate SRI hashes for CDN resources and include them in `<link>` or `<script>` tags to ensure browser verification of file integrity.
    4.  **Audit Package Sources (Advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, consider auditing the sources from which Ant Design packages are downloaded. Ensure you are using reputable package registries and potentially consider using a private registry or mirroring approach for greater control.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks - Package Tampering of Ant Design (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of using compromised `antd` packages that have been maliciously altered during distribution. Severity can be high if a tampered package introduces malicious code into your application via Ant Design.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks - Package Tampering of Ant Design:** Moderately reduces risk. Package manager checksums and SRI provide a good level of protection against common package tampering attempts.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Likely partially implemented. Package manager checksum verification and lock files are probably in use by default. SRI for CDN usage is less likely to be implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **SRI for Ant Design CDN Assets:** Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any Ant Design resources loaded from CDNs to enhance integrity verification.
        *   **Formal Package Source Auditing (High Security):** For very high-security needs, establish a more formal process for auditing and verifying the sources of Ant Design packages, potentially including using private registries or mirrored repositories.
