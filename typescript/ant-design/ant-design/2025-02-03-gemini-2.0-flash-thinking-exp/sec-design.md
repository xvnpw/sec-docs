# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a high-quality, comprehensive, and user-friendly UI component library for React applications.
 - Enable developers to build consistent and efficient user interfaces, accelerating development cycles.
 - Foster a strong open-source community around the library, encouraging contributions and wider adoption.
 - Maintain the library's reputation for stability, performance, and accessibility.

- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the UI components could be exploited in applications using Ant Design, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
 - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or the build process could compromise the integrity of the library.
 - Reputational damage due to security flaws or lack of responsiveness to security issues could erode user trust and adoption.
 - Lack of security awareness among contributors could lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: GitHub repository access control to manage who can contribute and modify the codebase. Implemented in GitHub repository settings.
 - security control: Code review process for pull requests to ensure code quality and identify potential issues. Implemented via GitHub pull request workflow.
 - security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub to report and manage bugs and feature requests, including security vulnerabilities. Implemented via GitHub Issues.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature of the project, making the codebase publicly accessible for vulnerability research (both by security researchers and malicious actors).

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Ant Design.
 - recommended security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
 - recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and incident response plan to handle security issues effectively.
 - recommended security control: Provide security training and awareness programs for core contributors and maintainers.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for maintainers and administrators accessing project settings and publishing packages.
  - Requirement: Consider multi-factor authentication for maintainer accounts to enhance security.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Role-based access control within the GitHub repository to manage permissions for different contributors (e.g., read-only, write, admin).
  - Requirement: Authorization controls for publishing packages to npm or other distribution channels, ensuring only authorized individuals can release new versions.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: While Ant Design is a UI library, components should be designed to handle potentially malicious input from developers using the library. Ensure components do not introduce vulnerabilities in applications due to improper handling of props or user-provided data.
  - Requirement: Validate data received from external sources during the build process (e.g., dependencies, assets) to prevent injection attacks or supply chain compromises.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: If Ant Design components handle sensitive data or implement features requiring encryption (though less likely for a UI library itself), ensure proper and secure cryptographic practices are followed.
  - Requirement: Securely store and manage any cryptographic keys or secrets used in the build or deployment processes.

- Build Process Description:
 - Developer makes code changes, commits them, and pushes to the GitHub repository.
 - GitHub repository triggers a webhook event upon code push.
 - CI/CD system (GitHub Actions) is triggered by the webhook.
 - CI/CD system checks out the code from the repository into a build environment.
 - CI/CD system installs project dependencies.
 - CI/CD system runs automated tests, linters, and static application security testing (SAST) tools to check code quality and security.
 - CI/CD system builds the npm package and documentation files.
 - Build artifacts are stored temporarily in build artifact storage within the CI/CD environment.
 - CI/CD system publishes the npm package to the npm registry.
 - CI/CD system deploys the documentation files to GitHub Pages.

- Build Process Security Controls:
 - security control: Secure CI/CD pipeline configuration to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 - security control: Secrets management to securely store and access credentials for publishing to npm and deploying documentation.
 - security control: Dependency scanning to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies during the build process.
 - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities before deployment.
 - security control: Code linting and formatting to enforce code quality and consistency.
 - security control: Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
 - security control: Build artifact integrity checks to ensure artifacts are not tampered with during the build and deployment process.
 - security control: Use of signed commits to verify the authenticity of code contributions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Ant Design UI library.
 - Ensuring the security of the UI components to prevent vulnerabilities in applications using the library.
 - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Ant Design project within the developer community.
 - Smooth and secure release process for new versions and updates.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source code: Publicly available, but integrity and confidentiality of development process are important.
  - Sensitivity: Medium (public, but modifications by unauthorized parties would be high impact).
 - npm package: Publicly available, but integrity is critical.
  - Sensitivity: High (public, but compromised package would have wide impact).
 - Documentation website content: Publicly available, integrity and availability are important.
  - Sensitivity: Medium (public, but defacement or unavailability would impact user experience).
 - CI/CD pipeline secrets (npm token, deployment keys): Confidential.
  - Sensitivity: High (compromise would allow unauthorized package publishing and website modification).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the CI/CD pipeline?
 - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure policy and incident response plan in place?
 - Are there regular security audits or penetration testing conducted for Ant Design?
 - What are the specific access control policies for the GitHub repository and npm package publishing?
 - Is multi-factor authentication enforced for maintainer accounts?
 - Are there any security training programs for contributors and maintainers?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable UI library for the open-source community. Security is a high priority for the project's long-term success and adoption.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: The project currently relies on standard GitHub security features and code review processes. There is room for improvement in implementing more proactive security measures like automated security scanning and formal security policies.
 - DESIGN: The project uses a standard open-source development and distribution model, leveraging GitHub for source code management and npm for package distribution. The documentation website is likely a static site hosted on GitHub Pages or a similar platform. The CI/CD pipeline is likely based on GitHub Actions.
