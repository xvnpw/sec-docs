# Attack Surface Analysis for ant-design/ant-design

## Attack Surface: [1. Component CVEs & 0-days](./attack_surfaces/1__component_cves_&_0-days.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities within specific Ant Design components, either publicly disclosed (CVEs) or unknown (0-days).
*   **Ant Design Contribution:** The vulnerability exists directly within the code of an Ant Design component.
*   **Example:** A flaw in the `AutoComplete` component allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a crafted input string.
*   **Impact:** Could range from minor UI disruption to complete application compromise, depending on the vulnerability. Data breaches, unauthorized access, and code execution are possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific CVE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** Maintain the latest stable Ant Design version. Monitor release notes and security advisories.
    *   **SCA Tools:** Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Redundant Server-Side Validation:** *Always* validate all data received from Ant Design components on the server, regardless of client-side validation.
    *   **Component Selection:** If a component has a history of severe vulnerabilities, consider alternatives.

## Attack Surface: [2. Misconfiguration & Default Settings (High-Risk Instances)](./attack_surfaces/2__misconfiguration_&_default_settings__high-risk_instances_.md)

*   **Description:** Using Ant Design components with insecure configurations or relying on unsafe default settings, *specifically in cases that lead to high-risk vulnerabilities*.
*   **Ant Design Contribution:** Ant Design provides configuration options, and incorrect choices can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Using the `Upload` component without restricting allowed file types, enabling an attacker to upload a malicious `.php` or `.exe` file.  This is a *high-risk* misconfiguration.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to severe vulnerabilities like file upload attacks leading to RCE, or significant data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (focusing on the high-risk misconfigurations).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly read the documentation for each component used, paying *critical* attention to security-related options.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Configure components with the absolute minimum necessary permissions and features.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the application's configuration, with a *specific focus* on Ant Design component usage and potential high-risk settings.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Have another developer review all Ant Design component implementations, emphasizing security-critical configurations.

## Attack Surface: [3. Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/3__supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of the Ant Design library itself or its dependencies at the source.
*   **Ant Design Contribution:** Ant Design, like any software, is vulnerable to supply chain attacks.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of the Ant Design npm package and publishes a compromised version.
*   **Impact:** Potentially severe; could lead to widespread compromise of applications using Ant Design.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use exact version numbers for Ant Design and its dependencies in `package.json` (and a lockfile).
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags when including Ant Design from a CDN.
    *   **Code Signing (If Available):** Verify signatures if Ant Design provides signed releases.
    *   **Monitor Security Announcements:** Stay informed about any security breaches related to Ant Design or its dependencies.
