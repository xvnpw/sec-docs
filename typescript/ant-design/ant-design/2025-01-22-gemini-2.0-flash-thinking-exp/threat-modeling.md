# Threat Model Analysis for ant-design/ant-design

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within a dependency used by Ant Design. This is achieved by targeting a vulnerable version of a library that Ant Design relies upon. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or a denial-of-service condition within applications using Ant Design.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, sensitive data breach, denial of service, unauthorized system access.
*   **Affected Component:** Indirectly affects all Ant Design components that rely on the vulnerable dependency. Primarily impacts the core library and components utilizing the vulnerable dependency's functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain Ant Design at the latest stable version to benefit from updated and patched dependencies.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including Ant Design's transitive dependencies.
    *   Establish a robust patch management process to promptly address and remediate identified dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Input Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_input_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through Ant Design input components such as `Input`, `TextArea`, or `InputNumber`. If the application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it using Ant Design components, the injected script can execute within the browsers of other users who interact with the application. This can enable attackers to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application's interface, or perform actions on behalf of compromised users.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, theft of sensitive user data, website defacement, phishing and social engineering attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `Input`, `TextArea`, `InputNumber`, and potentially other components that render user-provided text content, such as `Typography` or `Tooltip`, if used with unsanitized input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data, both on the client-side and, crucially, on the server-side.
    *   Employ secure output encoding techniques when rendering user-generated content within Ant Design components to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
    *   Enforce a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of scripts executed by the browser, thereby reducing the potential impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Conduct regular code audits, specifically focusing on user input handling and rendering within Ant Design components, to proactively identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Table Component Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_table_component_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through data presented within an Ant Design `Table` component. If the application renders unsanitized data retrieved from a database or an external API directly into the table columns, and if the table component's rendering logic is susceptible, the injected script can execute in the browsers of users viewing the table. This is analogous to XSS in input components but specifically targets the presentation of data within tables.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, theft of sensitive user data displayed in tables, website defacement, propagation of phishing attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `Table` component, specifically the column rendering and data display mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all data obtained from databases, APIs, or any external sources before rendering it within the `Table` component.
    *   Utilize secure output encoding when displaying data in table columns to prevent the interpretation of malicious code.
    *   Avoid rendering raw HTML or JavaScript code directly within table cells whenever possible. If dynamic content is necessary, ensure it is properly sanitized and rendered securely.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to provide an additional layer of defense against XSS attacks targeting table data.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised npm Package](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_npm_package.md)

*   **Description:** The official Ant Design npm package, or the infrastructure used for its distribution, is compromised by a malicious actor. This results in the injection of malicious code into the package. When developers install or update Ant Design through npm, they inadvertently incorporate this malicious code into their applications. This can grant the attacker control over applications using the compromised package, enabling them to steal sensitive data, inject further malware, or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using Ant Design, large-scale data breaches, disruption of the software supply chain, erosion of trust in open-source libraries.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially all Ant Design components, as malicious code could be injected into the core library or any part of the distributed package.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ package integrity verification tools (such as npm's built-in `integrity` checks or dedicated tools like `snyk`) to rigorously verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded npm packages, including Ant Design.
    *   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability reports related to npm and the broader JavaScript supply chain to stay informed about potential threats.
    *   Consider utilizing private npm registries or package mirrors to gain greater control over the sources of packages and reduce reliance on public infrastructure.
    *   Regularly audit project dependencies and promptly apply updates, especially security patches, to minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities in the supply chain.
