## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Components [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_components__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Script through Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **URL Parameters:** Attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript code in parameters that are used to populate Ant Design components (e.g., Table columns, Form field default values, Notification messages). When the application renders the component, the script executes in the user's browser.
        *   **Form Submissions:** Attacker submits a form with malicious JavaScript code in input fields. If the application re-displays this submitted data using Ant Design components without proper sanitization, the script executes.
        *   **API Responses Displayed in Components:** Attacker compromises a backend API or injects malicious data into a database that feeds data to the application. When the application fetches and displays this data using Ant Design components (e.g., in a Table, List, or Card), the malicious script from the API response executes.
    *   **Exploitation Examples:**
        *   Stealing user session cookies to hijack accounts.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the application's page.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge (e.g., making unauthorized transactions).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration/Usage Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configurationusage_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Component Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Misconfigure Components Insecurely [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Disable Input Validation:** Developers might disable built-in validation features of Ant Design Form components or other input components for convenience or due to misunderstanding security implications. This allows attackers to submit invalid or malicious data that the application is not prepared to handle.
            *   **Expose Sensitive Data in Component Attributes:** Developers might inadvertently expose sensitive data (e.g., API keys, internal IDs) in HTML attributes of Ant Design components, making it accessible in the client-side DOM and potentially to attackers.
            *   **Use Insecure Defaults:** Developers might rely on default configurations of Ant Design components without understanding their security implications. Some default settings might be less secure than stricter alternatives.
    *   **Improper Input Handling Around Ant Design Components [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Application fails to sanitize input *before* passing it to Ant Design components [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Developers might assume Ant Design components automatically sanitize all input. However, Ant Design primarily focuses on UI rendering and functionality, not comprehensive security sanitization. If the application doesn't sanitize user input *before* passing it to components that render dynamic content, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
        *   **Exploit Lack of Sanitization to Inject Malicious Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attackers exploit the lack of input sanitization to inject malicious payloads (e.g., JavaScript code for XSS, SQL queries for SQL injection if data is passed to backend queries). These payloads are then processed and rendered by Ant Design components or passed to backend systems, leading to exploitation.
    *   **Insecure Server-Side Integration with Ant Design Components [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Backend APIs are vulnerable [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **SQL Injection:** Ant Design Form components might be used to collect user input that is then directly used in SQL queries on the backend without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
            *   **API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Broken Authentication, Authorization):** Ant Design components often interact with backend APIs for data fetching or form submissions. If these APIs have vulnerabilities like broken authentication or authorization, attackers can exploit them through interactions initiated by Ant Design components.
            *   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization:** If the application's overall authentication or authorization mechanisms are weak, attackers might bypass them and interact with backend APIs through Ant Design components to gain unauthorized access or perform actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Scan Dependencies for Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Failure to Scan:** If the development team does not regularly scan Ant Design's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`, they remain unaware of potential security risks.
        *   **Ignoring Scan Results:** Even if scans are performed, developers might ignore or postpone addressing reported vulnerabilities due to time constraints or perceived low risk. This leaves the application vulnerable to exploitation if a dependency vulnerability is present and exploitable in the context of Ant Design usage.
    *   **Exploitation Examples (Indirect via Ant Design):**
        *   A vulnerability in a dependency (e.g., a utility library used by Ant Design) could be exploited to cause prototype pollution, which then affects Ant Design's internal logic, leading to XSS or other vulnerabilities in components.
        *   A dependency vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate data processed by Ant Design components, leading to unexpected behavior or security bypasses in the application.
