*   **Threat:** Compromised Ant Design Package
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Ant Design package on npm or a similar repository. They could inject malicious code into the package. When developers install or update Ant Design, this malicious code is included in their application.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the developer's environment. Attackers could steal sensitive data, inject malware, or perform any action with the application's privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire `ant-design` npm package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use package lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
        *   Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager to control and verify packages.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the Ant Design library.

*   **Threat:** Outdated Ant Design Version with Known XSS Vulnerability in Input Component
    *   **Description:** Developers use an outdated version of Ant Design that contains a known Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `Input` component. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an input field. When this input is rendered or processed by the application, the script executes in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, and potential redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The `Input` component (specifically older versions with known vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Ant Design updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Review release notes and security advisories for Ant Design to be aware of patched vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization on the server-side when displaying user-provided data, even if Ant Design components are expected to handle it.

*   **Threat:** XSS Vulnerability during Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with a Form Component
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR), a vulnerability in an Ant Design form component (e.g., `Input`, `TextArea`) could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are rendered directly into the initial HTML sent to the client. This script executes immediately when the page loads, bypassing some client-side security measures.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to client-side XSS, leading to user account compromise, data theft, and other malicious actions. SSR-based XSS can sometimes be more critical as it executes before client-side security measures are fully initialized.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Form components like `Input`, `TextArea`, and potentially others when used in an SSR context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper sanitization and encoding of user-provided data on the server-side before rendering Ant Design components.
        *   Utilize secure templating engines and frameworks that automatically handle output encoding.
        *   Keep Ant Design updated to benefit from any SSR-related security fixes.
