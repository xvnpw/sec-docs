# Attack Surface Analysis for ant-design/ant-design

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_component_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into web pages due to vulnerabilities in Ant Design components.
- **How Ant Design Contributes:** Certain Ant Design components might not properly sanitize user-provided data before rendering, or have flaws in handling dynamic content, allowing script injection.
- **Example:** A vulnerable version of the `Input` component allows an attacker to inject a `<script>` tag into its initial value, which executes when the component is rendered.
- **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Ant Design to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    - Avoid directly rendering unsanitized user input within Ant Design components.
    - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM-Based XSS)](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__dom-based_xss_.md)

- **Description:**  The attack payload is executed due to modifications in the DOM environment caused by client-side script interactions with Ant Design components.
- **How Ant Design Contributes:**  If the application uses Ant Design components in a way that allows attacker-controlled modification of the component's internal state or DOM structure through client-side JavaScript, it can lead to DOM-based XSS.
- **Example:** An attacker manipulates a URL fragment that is then used by JavaScript to dynamically update the content of an Ant Design `Card` component without proper sanitization.
- **Impact:** Similar to regular XSS, including session hijacking, data theft, and malicious actions.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully review and sanitize any data sources that influence the dynamic behavior of Ant Design components on the client-side.
    - Avoid directly manipulating the DOM of Ant Design components unless absolutely necessary and ensure proper sanitization if doing so.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Data Exposure through Component State](./attack_surfaces/client-side_data_exposure_through_component_state.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive data is unintentionally exposed through the client-side state of Ant Design components.
- **How Ant Design Contributes:** If sensitive data is stored in the state of Ant Design components and not handled securely, it could be accessible through client-side debugging tools or by manipulating the application's JavaScript.
- **Example:** Storing a user's API key directly in the state of an `Input` component.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for account compromise or unauthorized access.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the client-side state of components if possible.
    - If sensitive data must be handled client-side, encrypt it appropriately and ensure it is not easily accessible.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities that arise when Ant Design components are rendered on the server-side without proper data sanitization.
- **How Ant Design Contributes:** If Ant Design components are rendered on the server-side (e.g., using Next.js), vulnerabilities in the rendering process could lead to server-side XSS if data is not properly sanitized before being rendered within Ant Design components.
- **Example:**  Rendering user-provided HTML within an Ant Design component on the server without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that execute on the server.
- **Impact:** Server-side XSS, potential for server compromise depending on the vulnerability.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize all user-provided data before rendering it within Ant Design components on the server-side.
    - Follow secure coding practices for server-side rendering.
