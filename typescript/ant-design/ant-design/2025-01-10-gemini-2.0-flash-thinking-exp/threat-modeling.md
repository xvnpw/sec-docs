# Threat Model Analysis for ant-design/ant-design

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the application through user-controlled input fields that are then rendered by Ant Design components without proper sanitization *by the application developer*. This could happen when the application directly uses user input to populate component properties like `title`, `content`, or custom render functions. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the application.

**Impact:** High. Successful XSS can lead to account takeover, data theft, and malware distribution.

**Affected Component:** Components that render user-provided content, including but not limited to: `Tooltip`, `Popover`, `Modal` (content prop), `Notification`, `Message`, `Input` (if used for rendering), `Table` (custom `render` functions), `Select` (custom `label` or `value` rendering), and any component where developers directly embed unsanitized user input.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper input sanitization on the server-side and client-side before rendering data within Ant Design components.
* Utilize secure templating practices that automatically escape potentially harmful characters.
* Leverage Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
* Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar mechanisms unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution, ensuring thorough sanitization.

## Threat: [Logic Flaws and Security Misconfigurations in Complex Components](./threats/logic_flaws_and_security_misconfigurations_in_complex_components.md)

**Description:** Developers might misconfigure or misuse complex Ant Design components like `Form`, `Table`, or `Tree`, leading to security vulnerabilities. For example, incorrect form validation logic *implemented by the developer using the Ant Design Form component* could allow submission of invalid or malicious data. Improperly configured table filters or sorters *using Ant Design Table features* might expose sensitive information. Flaws in tree component logic *implemented using Ant Design Tree features* could allow unauthorized access to nodes or actions.

**Impact:** Medium to High. The impact depends on the specific misconfiguration and the sensitivity of the data or actions involved. Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `Form`, `Table`, `Tree`, `Select` (especially with custom filtering/searching), `Transfer`, and potentially other components with complex configuration options and event handling.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly understand the security implications of each component's configuration options and event handlers.
* Implement robust server-side validation to complement client-side checks.
* Follow Ant Design's best practices and security recommendations for component usage.
* Conduct thorough testing, including security testing, of all component configurations.
* Regularly review and audit the configuration of complex components.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Ant Design's Supply Chain](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_ant_design's_supply_chain.md)

**Description:** Ant Design relies on various third-party libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they could indirectly affect the security of the application using Ant Design. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the application's dependencies.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from low to critical, potentially leading to remote code execution or data breaches.

**Affected Component:**  Indirectly affects all components as the vulnerabilities reside in the underlying libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Ant Design to the latest version, which includes updates to its dependencies.
* Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the dependency tree.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
