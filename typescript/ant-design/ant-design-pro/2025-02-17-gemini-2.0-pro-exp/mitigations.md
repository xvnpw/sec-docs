## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization with DOMPurify for Ant Design Pro Components](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_with_dompurify_for_ant_design_pro_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Ant Design Pro Input Components:** Identify all Ant Design Pro components in your application that accept user input or display user-provided data. This includes, but is not limited to:
        *   `ProForm` components (e.g., `ProFormText`, `ProFormTextArea`, `ProFormSelect`, `ProFormDateRangePicker`)
        *   `Table` and `ProTable` (especially when rendering custom cell content)
        *   `Descriptions` and `ProDescriptions`
        *   `Card` (if displaying user-provided content in the title or body)
        *   `Modal` (if displaying user-provided content)
        *   Any custom components built using Ant Design Pro that handle user input.
    2.  **Install DOMPurify:** Add `DOMPurify` as a project dependency: `npm install dompurify` or `yarn add dompurify`.
    3.  **Import DOMPurify:** In the relevant components or utility functions, import `DOMPurify`: `import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';`
    4.  **Create Sanitization Function (Recommended):** Create a reusable function:
        ```javascript
        function sanitizeAntDInput(input) {
          return DOMPurify.sanitize(input, {
            ALLOWED_TAGS: [], // Start with an empty array.
            ALLOWED_ATTR: [],
          });
        }
        ```
    5.  **Sanitize Before Component Rendering:** *Critically*, sanitize the input *before* it's passed as a prop to the Ant Design Pro component.  This is usually done in the component's `value` prop or within a custom render function.
        ```javascript
        // Example with ProForm.TextArea
        <ProForm.Item name="userDescription">
          <ProForm.TextArea
            value={sanitizeAntDInput(formData.userDescription)} // Sanitize here!
            onChange={(value) => setFormData({ ...formData, userDescription: value })}
          />
        </ProForm.Item>

        // Example with ProTable custom cell rendering
        const columns = [
          {
            title: 'Comment',
            dataIndex: 'commentText',
            render: (text) => sanitizeAntDInput(text), // Sanitize here!
          },
        ];
        ```
    6. **Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML:** Do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with any data that comes from, or could be influenced by, user input, even indirectly. Ant Design Pro components should *not* require you to use this. If a component *does* seem to require it, investigate alternative approaches or thoroughly sanitize the input with DOMPurify *before* using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript through Ant Design Pro components that render user-provided data. This is the *primary* threat this mitigation addresses.
    *   **HTML Injection (Severity: Medium):** Prevents the injection of arbitrary HTML, which could disrupt the layout or be used for phishing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if implemented correctly and comprehensively for *all* relevant components).
    *   **HTML Injection:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Implemented for `ProForm` components in `src/pages/User/Profile.js`, but not for `ProTable` in `src/pages/Admin/Users.js`) - *Replace with your project's details*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Missing in all custom components that render user-provided data. Missing in `ProDescriptions` component in `src/pages/Product/Details.js`) - *Replace with your project's details*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Ant Design Pro Component Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_ant_design_pro_component_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Component Documentation Review:** Before using *any* Ant Design Pro component, thoroughly read its documentation on the official Ant Design Pro website. Pay close attention to all configuration options and their descriptions.
    2.  **Minimal Configuration:** Start with the *most restrictive* configuration possible. Only enable features and options that are *absolutely necessary* for the component's intended functionality. Avoid enabling options that you don't fully understand.
    3.  **Data Access Control (ProTable, ProForm):**
        *   **ProTable:** If `ProTable` is fetching data from an API, ensure the API endpoint itself is properly secured (authentication/authorization).  Don't rely solely on `ProTable`'s configuration to limit data access.  Use the `request` prop to control how data is fetched and ensure it only retrieves the necessary data.
        *   **ProForm:** If `ProForm` is submitting data, ensure the API endpoint it submits to is properly secured.  Use the `onSubmit` prop to control the submission process and validate the data *before* sending it to the server.
    4.  **Routing Configuration (with umi):** If you're using Ant Design Pro's built-in routing (usually with `umi`), carefully define your routes and access controls within the `config/config.ts` (or similar) file.  Use the `access` property to control which users can access specific routes.  Ensure that sensitive routes are protected.
    5.  **Code Reviews:** Have another developer review your Ant Design Pro component configurations, specifically looking for overly permissive settings or potential misconfigurations.
    6. **Avoid Overriding Styles Unsafely:** Be cautious when overriding Ant Design Pro's default styles.  Avoid using inline styles with user-provided data, as this could create XSS vulnerabilities.  If you need to customize styles based on user input, use CSS classes and sanitize the class names.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data due to misconfigured components (e.g., a `ProTable` displaying more data than intended).
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying data through misconfigured components or routes (e.g., a `ProForm` submitting data to an incorrect endpoint).
    *   **Functionality Misuse (Severity: Variable):** Prevents unintended component behavior that could lead to security issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly, depending on the sensitivity of the data and the specific component configuration.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced, depending on the access controls implemented in the component and the associated API endpoints.
    *   **Functionality Misuse:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Implemented for `ProTable` components displaying user data, ensuring only necessary columns are displayed. Basic routing configuration with `access` control.) - *Replace with your project's details*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Missing comprehensive review of all `ProForm` configurations.  Need to review and tighten routing configuration for admin pages.) - *Replace with your project's details*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logic Flaws Prevention in Custom Components Based on Ant Design Pro](./mitigation_strategies/logic_flaws_prevention_in_custom_components_based_on_ant_design_pro.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding guidelines for React and JavaScript. This includes:
        *   Avoiding `eval()` and similar functions.
        *   Properly handling user input (as described in the sanitization strategy).
        *   Using secure methods for generating random numbers (if needed).
        *   Avoiding common JavaScript pitfalls that can lead to vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of *all* custom components, paying particular attention to:
        *   How user input is handled.
        *   How data is rendered.
        *   Any interactions with Ant Design Pro components.
        *   Any logic that could potentially be manipulated by an attacker.
    3.  **Unit and Integration Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for your custom components. These tests should cover:
        *   Normal use cases.
        *   Edge cases.
        *   Potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., attempting to inject malicious input).
        *   Interactions with Ant Design Pro components.
    4. **State Management:** If your custom component manages state, ensure that state updates are handled securely. Avoid directly mutating state, and use appropriate state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) if necessary.
    5. **Component Composition:** When composing custom components from existing Ant Design Pro components, be mindful of how data flows between them. Ensure that data is properly sanitized and validated at each stage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities introduced by custom logic.
    *   **Logic Flaws (Severity: Variable):** Mitigates a wide range of potential vulnerabilities that could arise from incorrect or insecure component logic.
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data due to flaws in custom component logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced, depending on the thoroughness of input handling and code reviews.
    *   **Logic Flaws:** Risk significantly reduced by comprehensive testing and secure coding practices.
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Basic unit tests for some custom components. Code reviews are conducted, but not always focused on security.) - *Replace with your project's details*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Missing comprehensive unit and integration tests for all custom components. Need to establish a more rigorous code review process with a security checklist.) - *Replace with your project's details*
