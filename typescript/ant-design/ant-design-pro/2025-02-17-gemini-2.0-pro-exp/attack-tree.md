## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting a Vulnerable Component](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_a_vulnerable_component.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE) in an outdated version of Ant Design Pro or one of its components.
*   **Steps:**
    *   `***1a. Identify Vulnerable Component [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker identifies an outdated version of Ant Design Pro or a specific component with a known vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If updates are not regular) / Low (If updates are frequent)
        *   **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability, could lead to RCE, data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Public CVE databases and scanners exist)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Intermediate (Script kiddies can use automated tools)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring for known vulnerabilities and unusual traffic)
    *   `***1b. Craft Exploit Payload***`:
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious input designed to trigger the identified vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the complexity of the vulnerability)
        *   **Impact:** High (Same as 1a)
        *   **Effort:** Medium - High (May require understanding of the vulnerability and exploit development)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Hard (Requires intrusion detection systems and traffic analysis)
    *   `***1c. Execute Exploit [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker delivers the payload to the vulnerable component, typically through a user input field or a manipulated request.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the attack vector and application's exposure)
        *   **Impact:** High (Same as 1a)
        *   **Effort:** Low - Medium (Could be as simple as submitting a form or sending a request)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Hard (Requires monitoring for unusual behavior and potentially analyzing logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting a Dependency Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_a_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party library used by Ant Design Pro.
*   **Steps:**
    *   `***3a. Identify Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker uses tools or vulnerability databases to identify vulnerable dependencies within Ant Design Pro's dependency tree.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - High (Dependencies are often overlooked, and vulnerabilities are common)
        *   **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability in the dependency)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools like `npm audit` exist)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (With dependency scanning tools)
    *   `***3b. Exploit Vulnerability [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker leverages the known vulnerability in the dependency to compromise the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the exploitability of the dependency vulnerability)
        *   **Impact:** High (Same as 3a)
        *   **Effort:** Medium - High (May require understanding the dependency and its vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Hard (Requires intrusion detection and traffic analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Leveraging Default Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_leveraging_default_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting insecure default configurations in Ant Design Pro.
*   **Steps:**
    *   `***4a. Identify Default Config Weaknesses [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker examines the application's configuration and identifies default settings that are insecure (e.g., default API keys, exposed services, default passwords).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - High (Many developers forget to change default settings)
        *   **Impact:** Medium - High (Depends on the specific default setting)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Requires reviewing documentation and configuration files)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (With configuration reviews and security scans)
    *   `***4b. Leverage Default Config [CRITICAL]***`:
        *   The attacker uses the default configuration to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions (e.g., using a default API key to access a service, using a default password to log in).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - High (If a default setting is vulnerable, it's likely to be exploited)
        *   **Impact:** Medium - High (Same as 4a)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Often requires minimal effort, like using a default password)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie - Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring for unauthorized access and unusual activity)
