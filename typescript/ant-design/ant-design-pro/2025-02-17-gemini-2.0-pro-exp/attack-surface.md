# Attack Surface Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Attack Surface: [Outdated `antd` and Related Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated__antd__and_related_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in older versions of the `antd` component library or other related dependencies (@ant-design/icons, @ant-design/pro-components, etc.) that `ant-design-pro` directly uses.
*   **How `ant-design-pro` Contributes:** `ant-design-pro` is built upon `antd` and its related libraries.  It *directly* depends on these, inheriting their vulnerabilities if not kept up-to-date. This is a direct dependency relationship.
*   **Example:** A known XSS vulnerability exists in an older version of `antd`'s `Table` component, which `ant-design-pro` uses extensively in its `ProTable` component. An attacker exploits this to inject malicious script.
*   **Impact:** XSS, data leakage, potential remote code execution (depending on the specific `antd` vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific CVE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Management:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Dependabot, or Snyk to automatically check for and update outdated dependencies, specifically focusing on `antd` and its ecosystem. Configure CI/CD pipelines to run these checks on every build.
    *   **Regular Manual Audits:** Supplement automated checks with periodic manual reviews of `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) to ensure no `antd`-related dependencies are missed.
    *   **Prioritize Security Updates:** Treat security updates for `antd` and related packages as high-priority, even if they introduce minor breaking changes.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Pro Components](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_pro_components.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of `ant-design-pro`'s "Pro" components (e.g., `ProTable`, `ProForm`, `ProLayout`), leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **How `ant-design-pro` Contributes:** This is *directly* related to the features and functionality provided by `ant-design-pro`. The misconfiguration occurs within the framework's own components.
*   **Example:** A `ProForm` is used to collect user data, but the developer relies solely on the client-side validation provided by `ProForm` and neglects server-side validation. An attacker bypasses the client-side checks and submits malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure, denial-of-service, unauthorized data modification, SQL injection (if backend interaction is involved), other injection attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Documentation Review:** Carefully study the official `ant-design-pro` documentation for each Pro component used. Pay close attention to security-related configuration options and best practices.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Mandatory):**  *Never* trust client-side validation alone. Implement robust server-side validation for *all* data submitted through Pro components. This is non-negotiable.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure Pro components with the minimum necessary permissions and access to data. Avoid overly permissive settings.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Sanitize all inputs received from Pro components and encode outputs appropriately to prevent injection attacks, even with server-side validation in place. This adds a layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [Broken Access Control (Routing and Permissions within `ant-design-pro`'s Context)](./attack_surfaces/broken_access_control__routing_and_permissions_within__ant-design-pro_'s_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of routing or permission checks *specifically within the context of `ant-design-pro`'s routing and authority management features*.
*   **How `ant-design-pro` Contributes:** `ant-design-pro` provides its own mechanisms for handling routes and user permissions (often using `umi` under the hood).  Incorrect use of *these specific features* creates the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  `ant-design-pro`'s `authority` configuration is used to restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.  However, a bug in the configuration or a misunderstanding of how it works allows a user with a "viewer" role to access a route intended only for "admin" users.  This is *distinct* from a general server-side authorization failure; it's a failure within `ant-design-pro`'s own access control system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Understand `ant-design-pro`'s Authority System:** Thoroughly understand how `ant-design-pro`'s routing and authority mechanisms work. Read the documentation carefully and experiment with different configurations in a development environment.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (as a Backup):**  Even when using `ant-design-pro`'s authority features, *always* implement server-side authorization checks as a backup.  This ensures that even if the client-side checks are bypassed or misconfigured, the server will still enforce access control.
    *   **Test Thoroughly with Different Roles:**  Test all routes and functionality with users assigned to different roles to ensure that the `ant-design-pro` authority configuration is working as expected. Include negative tests (attempting to access restricted resources).
    * **Regularly review configuration:** Regularly review the routing and authority configuration files to ensure they are up-to-date and reflect the intended access control policies.
