# Threat Model Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Threat: [Component Vulnerability Exploitation (Remote Code Execution)](./threats/component_vulnerability_exploitation__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a specific `antd` component used by `ant-design-pro`.  This could be a flaw in how a component like `Upload`, a rich text editor (often integrated with `antd`), or even a complex input component processes user-supplied data. The attacker crafts a malicious input that exploits this vulnerability, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the *server*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise.  The attacker gains full control over the application server, enabling data theft, application modification, malware installation, and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `antd` components, especially those handling user input or file uploads.  Crucially:
        *   `Upload` (vulnerable versions, improper file type/content validation)
        *   `Rich Text Editor` (third-party editor integrated with `antd`, vulnerable to XSS or RCE)
        *   Any custom component built on top of a vulnerable `antd` component.
        *   Potentially `Input`, `Textarea` (if a specific, severely vulnerable version is used *and* server-side validation is completely absent).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Patching:** Upon vulnerability disclosure in `antd` or related components, *immediately* update to the patched version. Monitor Ant Design's security advisories and those of any integrated rich text editors.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerable dependencies *before* deployment.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and validation, *regardless* of any client-side validation. Use a well-vetted sanitization library. This is the primary defense.
        *   **File Upload Restrictions (Strict):** For `Upload` components:
            *   Strictly limit allowed file types using a *whitelist* (not a blacklist).
            *   Validate file *content*, not just extensions.
            *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root.
            *   Rename uploaded files to prevent direct access.
            *   Consider using a dedicated, secure file storage service (e.g., AWS S3) with proper security configurations.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to help detect and block malicious requests targeting known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack (Malicious Package)](./threats/supply_chain_attack__malicious_package_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `ant-design-pro` or `antd` package itself on npm (or a closely related, required dependency). They inject malicious code into the package. This code executes when the application is built or run, potentially affecting all users.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise. All users of the application are at risk. The attacker could steal credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data. The application's reputation is severely damaged.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `ant-design-pro` framework, `antd`, or any of their *direct* dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Integrity Checks (Mandatory):**  Use `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (yarn) to *ensure* the integrity of downloaded packages. These files contain cryptographic hashes verified during installation.  This is a *critical* first line of defense.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to *specific* versions (e.g., `antd: "4.24.0"`, not `antd: "^4.24.0"`) to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce malicious code.  *However*, balance this with the need for security updates. Use a tool like Dependabot to manage this carefully, reviewing each proposed update.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and *suspicious changes*.  Look for unusual package updates or modifications.

## Threat: [Framework Logic Flaw (Authentication Bypass)](./threats/framework_logic_flaw__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a flaw in the authentication or authorization logic *within* `ant-design-pro`'s routing or state management system. This could be a bug in how permissions are checked (e.g., in `src/access.ts`) or how user sessions are managed. The attacker exploits this to bypass authentication and access protected areas.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access. The attacker gains access to sensitive data or functionality that should be restricted to authenticated users, leading to data breaches or modification.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ant-design-pro`'s routing system (`src/layouts`, `src/access.ts`, `src/models/user.ts` if using the default user model), authentication helpers, and any *custom code* that interacts with these.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `ant-design-pro` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes that address framework-level vulnerabilities.
        *   **Server-Side Authorization (Always):** Implement robust server-side authorization checks *completely independent* of any client-side logic provided by `ant-design-pro`. *Never* rely solely on client-side routing or state management for security. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Code Reviews (Thorough):** Thoroughly review any custom code that interacts with `ant-design-pro`'s authentication or authorization features, paying close attention to potential bypasses.
        *   **Avoid Custom Authentication Logic:** If possible, use well-established authentication protocols and libraries (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) *instead* of relying solely on `ant-design-pro`'s built-in authentication helpers.  If you *must* customize, do so with extreme caution and expert review.

## Threat: [Over-Reliance on Client-Side Security (Data Manipulation) - *Specifically related to ant-design-pro*](./threats/over-reliance_on_client-side_security__data_manipulation__-_specifically_related_to_ant-design-pro.md)

* **Description:** The developer *incorrectly* assumes that `antd` form validation or other client-side checks provided by `antd` components are sufficient for security. An attacker bypasses these client-side checks (easily done with browser developer tools) and sends malicious or invalid data to the server.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, and potential for *other* server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection) if the server doesn't properly validate the input.
    * **Affected Component:** Any `antd` component that handles user input, *especially* `Form`, `Input`, `Select`, `DatePicker`, and any custom components built using these.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation (Always and Comprehensive):** Implement comprehensive server-side validation for *all* user input, *regardless* of any client-side checks provided by `antd`. This is non-negotiable.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input on the *server* to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities (if interacting with a database).
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure database users and application users have only the minimum necessary privileges.
