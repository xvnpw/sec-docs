## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Ant Design Pro](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_ant_design_pro.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate objective of all the identified attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ant Design Pro Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ant_design_pro_dependencies.md)

Ant Design Pro relies on various dependencies like React, Ant Design (the core UI library), and other supporting libraries. If any of these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_dependency.md)

This is a crucial step for attackers targeting dependency vulnerabilities. Successfully identifying a vulnerable dependency opens the door for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Identified Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_identified_vulnerability.md)

Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, this node represents the action of leveraging that vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ant Design Pro Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ant_design_pro_components.md)

Ant Design Pro provides a rich set of pre-built UI components. Vulnerabilities might exist within the code of these components themselves, allowing for direct exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Identified Component Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_identified_component_vulnerability.md)

Similar to dependency vulnerabilities, once a flaw in an Ant Design Pro component is found, this node represents the act of exploiting it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Build Process or Included Tooling](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_build_process_or_included_tooling.md)

The build process for an Ant Design Pro application involves numerous tools and dependencies (e.g., npm/yarn, webpack, babel). Compromising these can have significant consequences, allowing attackers to inject malicious code before deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE during the build process](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce_during_the_build_process.md)

This node represents the successful outcome of exploiting build process vulnerabilities, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code during the application's build phase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Outdated Dependency with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/identify_outdated_dependency_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers can easily use automated tools and databases to find outdated dependencies with publicly known vulnerabilities, making this a likely starting point for attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Dependency Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_dependency_vulnerability.md)

Exploiting vulnerable dependencies to achieve RCE allows attackers to gain full control of the server, representing a critical security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Dependency Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dependency_vulnerability.md)

While less severe than RCE, XSS vulnerabilities in dependencies can still lead to significant damage, including session hijacking and data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Client-Side Vulnerability in a Component (e.g., XSS in a specific form element)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_client-side_vulnerability_in_a_component__e_g___xss_in_a_specific_form_element_.md)

Client-side vulnerabilities like XSS in UI components are relatively common if developers are not careful with input handling and output encoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script via Vulnerable Component (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_via_vulnerable_component__xss_.md)

Once a client-side vulnerability is identified in a component, injecting malicious scripts is often straightforward, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities Present in Example Code Copied Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_present_in_example_code_copied_directly.md)

Developers often copy and paste code from examples without fully understanding the security implications. If the example code contains vulnerabilities, this can introduce significant risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Routing or Navigation Patterns](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_routing_or_navigation_patterns.md)

Misconfigured routing is a common web application vulnerability. If Ant Design Pro's routing mechanisms are not properly implemented, it can lead to unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization due to Misconfigured Routes](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_due_to_misconfigured_routes.md)

A direct consequence of insecure routing is the ability to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, granting attackers access to restricted parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_dependency.md)

While potentially requiring more effort, a successful supply chain attack can have a critical impact, allowing attackers to introduce malicious code that is implicitly trusted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build Tools (e.g., webpack, babel plugins)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_build_tools__e_g___webpack__babel_plugins_.md)

Build tools are complex software and can contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these can allow attackers to inject malicious code during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE during the build process](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce_during_the_build_process.md)

As mentioned in Critical Nodes, achieving RCE during the build process allows for the injection of malicious code directly into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Custom Themes or Styles](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_custom_themes_or_styles.md)

If the application allows for custom themes or styles, attackers might be able to inject malicious code through these mechanisms, leading to XSS or other undesirable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve XSS through Theme Overrides](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_xss_through_theme_overrides.md)

A specific instance of injecting malicious code via themes, where attackers leverage theme overrides to inject JavaScript that executes in the user's browser.
