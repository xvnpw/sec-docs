# Threat Model Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured Routing Guards](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_routing_guards.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the way Ant Design Pro's routing system is configured. If developers fail to implement proper authentication and authorization checks within the framework's route guards, attackers can bypass intended access restrictions. This allows them to directly navigate to and access protected routes or functionalities without proper credentials.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative panels, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete compromise of the application's intended security model.
- **Affected Component:** The routing module within Ant Design Pro's layout (typically found in `/src/layouts` or a similar structure), specifically the route configuration files and any custom route guarding logic implemented using the framework's features.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust server-side authorization checks to validate user permissions for every request, regardless of client-side routing.
    - Carefully configure Ant Design Pro's routing guards to enforce authentication and authorization checks for all protected routes using the framework's provided mechanisms.
    - Avoid relying solely on client-side routing for security. Ensure backend validation complements the frontend routing.
    - Regularly review and test routing configurations to identify potential bypasses.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Ant Design Pro's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_ant_design_pro's_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Ant Design Pro relies on a set of third-party npm packages. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, applications using Ant Design Pro become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities present in the libraries that Ant Design Pro utilizes for its functionalities. This is a direct consequence of choosing and relying on these specific dependencies within the framework.
- **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, the impact can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution on the client's browser or even the server if the vulnerable dependency is used in the backend as well.
- **Affected Component:** Indirectly affects the entire application as it stems from vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries that Ant Design Pro depends on. This includes core React libraries and specific dependencies used by Ant Design Pro components and its core functionalities.
- **Risk Severity:** Can range from High to Critical depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Ant Design Pro to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerable dependencies.
    - Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    - Implement a process for monitoring and updating dependencies proactively.
    - Consider using dependency scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and alert on vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Internationalization (i18n)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_internationalization__i18n_.md)

- **Description:** If Ant Design Pro's i18n features are used in a way that allows untrusted or user-provided content to be incorporated into translation messages without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts. When these translated messages are rendered by Ant Design Pro components, the injected scripts will execute in the user's browser. This is a direct consequence of how Ant Design Pro handles and renders translated content.
- **Impact:** Similar to other XSS attacks, this can lead to session hijacking (stealing user cookies), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or the execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Affected Component:** The i18n module within Ant Design Pro and any components that directly render translated text using the framework's i18n functionalities.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize all external input or user-provided content before incorporating it into translation messages.
    - Ensure that translation files are sourced from trusted locations and are protected from unauthorized modification.
    - If allowing user contributions to translations, implement strict validation and sanitization processes before the translations are used by the application.
    - Review how Ant Design Pro's i18n features handle different types of content and ensure proper escaping or sanitization is applied where necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations in Components Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations_in_components_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Certain Ant Design Pro components might have default configurations that are not secure or require specific configuration steps to ensure security. If developers fail to adjust these default settings or misconfigure the components, it can lead to vulnerabilities. This is a direct risk introduced by the default behavior or configuration options provided by the framework's components.
- **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific component and misconfiguration. It could lead to issues like allowing the upload of malicious files due to missing file type restrictions in the `Upload` component, or exposing sensitive data due to improper handling of data in components like `Table`.
- **Affected Component:** Various components with configurable security-related settings, such as the `Upload` component (default allowed file types, size limits), data display components like `Table` (default HTML escaping behavior), and potentially other components with security-relevant options.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly review the documentation for each Ant Design Pro component being used, paying close attention to security-related configuration options and recommended best practices.
    - Explicitly configure components with security best practices in mind, overriding insecure defaults.
    - Implement security testing, specifically focusing on how Ant Design Pro components are configured and used, to identify potential misconfigurations.
    - Follow security guidelines and recommendations provided by the Ant Design Pro documentation.
