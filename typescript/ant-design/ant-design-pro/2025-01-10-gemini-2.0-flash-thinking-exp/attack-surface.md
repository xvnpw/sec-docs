# Attack Surface Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on third-party libraries (npm packages) that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Ant Design Pro Contributes:** Ant Design Pro has a significant number of dependencies, increasing the overall attack surface by introducing more potential points of failure. Updates to these dependencies are managed separately from the core application code.
    *   **Example:** An outdated version of `lodash` (a common dependency) used by Ant Design Pro might have a known prototype pollution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update all dependencies, including those of Ant Design Pro.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk) during development and CI/CD pipelines.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Consider using lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock) to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__within_components.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Ant Design Pro Contributes:**  While Ant Design components are generally secure, improper handling of user-provided data within custom components *built on top of Ant Design* or through configuration options *provided by Ant Design components* could introduce XSS vulnerabilities. Developers might incorrectly assume built-in sanitization handles all cases within the framework's components.
    *   **Example:** A custom form component built using Ant Design's form elements might not properly sanitize user input before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject a `<script>` tag.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user input before rendering it in components, especially when using Ant Design components to display user-provided data.
        *   Utilize browser's built-in XSS protection mechanisms (Content Security Policy - CSP).
        *   Employ secure coding practices and avoid directly rendering unsanitized HTML within Ant Design components.
        *   Regularly review and test custom components built with Ant Design for XSS vulnerabilities.
