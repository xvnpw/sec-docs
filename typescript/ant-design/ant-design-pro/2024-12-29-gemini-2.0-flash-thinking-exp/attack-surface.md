Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `ant-design-pro` and with "High" or "Critical" risk severity:

**High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Ant Design Pro:**

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  The application relies on third-party libraries (React, Ant Design core, etc.) that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Ant Design Pro Contributes:** `ant-design-pro` bundles and depends on a specific set of these libraries. If these dependencies are outdated or have known vulnerabilities, applications using `ant-design-pro` inherit this risk.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of `lodash` (a common utility library often used in React projects) could be present in the dependencies of `ant-design-pro`, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `ant-design-pro` and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and patching dependency vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI Components
    *   **Description:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Ant Design Pro Contributes:** While Ant Design components are generally secure, improper usage or customization within `ant-design-pro` can introduce XSS vulnerabilities. This can occur if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being rendered within Ant Design components.
    *   **Example:** A developer might use an Ant Design `Input` component to display user-generated content without proper escaping. An attacker could submit content containing malicious JavaScript that would then execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data rendered within Ant Design Pro components.
        *   Utilize browser security features like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
        *   Regularly review custom component implementations for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Client-Side Routing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  Access control logic implemented solely on the client-side can be bypassed.
    *   **How Ant Design Pro Contributes:** `ant-design-pro` relies heavily on client-side routing for navigation and potentially for managing access to different parts of the application. If authorization checks are only performed in the client-side code, attackers can manipulate the routing logic to access restricted areas.
    *   **Example:** An application might use `ant-design-pro`'s routing to hide certain menu items based on user roles on the client-side. An attacker could modify the client-side code or directly navigate to the route to bypass these client-side checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce all critical authorization checks on the server-side. Client-side checks should only be used for UI/UX purposes, not for security.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms on the backend.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side routing for security.
