# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Dependency Scanning for Ant Design Pro Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/automated_dependency_scanning_for_ant_design_pro_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Utilize dependency scanning tools (like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to specifically monitor the dependencies brought in by Ant Design Pro and its core libraries (Ant Design, React, etc.).
    *   Step 2: Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan `package.json` and lock files for vulnerabilities in the Ant Design Pro dependency tree during builds.
    *   Step 3: Configure the tools to alert developers or break builds upon detecting vulnerabilities in Ant Design Pro's dependencies, prioritizing high and critical severity issues.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review scan results and prioritize updates for vulnerable packages within the Ant Design Pro ecosystem.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Ant Design Pro Dependencies** - Severity: High
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Ant Design Pro (directly or indirectly) to compromise the application. This is amplified by the large dependency tree of modern frontend frameworks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Ant Design Pro Dependencies**: High Reduction - Proactively identifies and facilitates remediation of vulnerabilities within the specific dependency context of Ant Design Pro.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `npm audit` is run manually occasionally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated integration of dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline for every build.  Use of more advanced tools like Snyk or Dependabot for deeper analysis and automated fixes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Ant Design Pro Layout and Routing](./mitigation_strategies/secure_role-based_access_control__rbac__using_ant_design_pro_layout_and_routing.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Leverage Ant Design Pro's layout components (e.g., `ProLayout`) and routing mechanisms to implement UI-level RBAC.
    *   Step 2: Define user roles and map them to specific routes and menu items within Ant Design Pro's configuration.
    *   Step 3: Utilize Ant Design Pro's `AuthorizedRoute` or similar components to conditionally render routes and components based on user roles, controlling access to different sections of the application UI.
    *   Step 4: Ensure backend API authorization complements the frontend RBAC implemented with Ant Design Pro, preventing bypass of UI restrictions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via UI** - Severity: Medium to High
        *   Users gaining access to UI sections and functionalities within the Ant Design Pro application that they are not authorized to use, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via UI Misconfiguration** - Severity: Medium
        *   Exploiting misconfigurations in Ant Design Pro's routing or layout to bypass intended access controls and gain elevated privileges within the UI.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via UI**: Medium to High Reduction - Effectively restricts UI access based on roles when implemented correctly within Ant Design Pro.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via UI Misconfiguration**: Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by enforcing role-based navigation and component visibility within the framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic menu item visibility is controlled based on user roles in Ant Design Pro's menu configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular role-based routing using `AuthorizedRoute` or similar components for stricter UI access control.  Tight integration and synchronization with backend API authorization logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Data Handling in Ant Design Pro Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_data_handling_in_ant_design_pro_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When using Ant Design Pro components (like `ProTable`, `ProForm`, `ProDescriptions`) to display or interact with data fetched from APIs, ensure secure data handling practices.
    *   Step 2: Sanitize and encode data received from APIs *before* rendering it within Ant Design Pro components to prevent client-side injection vulnerabilities (XSS).
    *   Step 3: When submitting data back to APIs using Ant Design Pro forms, validate and sanitize user inputs on the client-side *before* sending the data, and always re-validate on the backend.
    *   Step 4: Be mindful of displaying sensitive data in Ant Design Pro components. Use appropriate components and techniques (masking, secure input types) to minimize exposure in the UI.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via API Data** - Severity: High
        *   Malicious data injected into APIs being rendered unsafely in Ant Design Pro components, leading to XSS attacks.
    *   **Client-Side Data Injection via Forms** - Severity: Medium
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side form handling within Ant Design Pro to inject malicious data into API requests.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in UI** - Severity: Medium to High
        *   Unintentional or unnecessary display of sensitive data within Ant Design Pro components, increasing the risk of data leakage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via API Data**: High Reduction - Prevents XSS by ensuring data from APIs is safely rendered within Ant Design Pro components.
    *   **Client-Side Data Injection via Forms**: Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by implementing client-side validation and sanitization in Ant Design Pro forms.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in UI**: Medium Reduction - Minimizes exposure by promoting secure data display practices within the framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic input validation is used in some forms.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and comprehensive sanitization of API data before rendering in all Ant Design Pro components.  More robust client-side validation and sanitization in all forms.  Systematic review of sensitive data display practices across the application's UI built with Ant Design Pro.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Customization and Extension of Ant Design Pro Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_customization_and_extension_of_ant_design_pro_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When customizing or extending Ant Design Pro components, or creating custom components within an Ant Design Pro project, adhere to secure coding practices.
    *   Step 2: Avoid directly injecting user-controlled data into component templates or JSX without rigorous sanitization.
    *   Step 3: Carefully review and audit any custom component code for potential client-side vulnerabilities, especially XSS and client-side injection risks.
    *   Step 4: When using Ant Design Pro's theming or customization features, ensure that customizations do not inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g., by exposing sensitive information or altering security-relevant behavior).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS and Client-Side Injection in Custom Components** - Severity: High
        *   Vulnerabilities introduced through insecure coding practices when creating custom components or modifying existing Ant Design Pro components.
    *   **Security Issues via Theming/Customization** - Severity: Low to Medium
        *   Unintentional security weaknesses introduced through misconfigurations or insecure customizations of Ant Design Pro's theming or extension mechanisms.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS and Client-Side Injection in Custom Components**: High Reduction - Prevents vulnerabilities by promoting secure coding practices in custom component development within the Ant Design Pro context.
    *   **Security Issues via Theming/Customization**: Low to Medium Reduction - Minimizes risk by encouraging secure practices when customizing the framework's appearance and behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic code reviews are performed for custom components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security-focused code reviews for all custom components and customizations.  Static analysis security testing (SAST) applied to custom component code.  Specific guidelines and training for developers on secure customization of Ant Design Pro.
