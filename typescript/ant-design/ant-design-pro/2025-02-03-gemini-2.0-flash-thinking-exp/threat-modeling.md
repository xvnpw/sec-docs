# Threat Model Analysis for ant-design/ant-design-pro

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used by Ant Design Pro (e.g., in Ant Design, React, or other libraries). They might achieve this by crafting specific requests or inputs that trigger the vulnerability in the vulnerable dependency code executed within the application.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to account compromise, Denial of Service (DoS) making the application unavailable, or sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:**  Dependencies (package.json, node_modules), potentially all components relying on vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Ant Design Pro and all its dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect and alert on known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories from Ant Design, React, and npm/yarn ecosystems for timely patching of vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Routing Configuration Exposure](./threats/insecure_routing_configuration_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and accesses administrative or sensitive application routes due to misconfigured routing rules within the Ant Design Pro application. This could be due to overly permissive route definitions or failure to implement proper authentication/authorization checks on specific routes.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functionalities, or internal application logic. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or manipulation of application settings.
*   **Affected Component:**  `router` configuration (e.g., `config/routes.ts` or similar routing configuration files), `AuthorizedRoute` component, `useAccess` hook.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict and well-defined routing rules, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive routes.
    *   Utilize Ant Design Pro's `AuthorizedRoute` component and `useAccess` hook to enforce role-based access control on routes.
    *   Avoid exposing administrative or internal routes directly under predictable paths.
    *   Regularly review routing configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or overly permissive rules.
    *   Implement server-side route protection as a secondary layer of security.

## Threat: [Client-Side XSS via Improper Component Usage](./threats/client-side_xss_via_improper_component_usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed in a user's browser. This can happen if developers improperly use Ant Design Pro components by rendering unsanitized user-provided data, especially with components like `Typography.Text`, `Tooltip`, or custom components that might use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar unsafe practices.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive user data, and execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:**  Various UI components (e.g., `Typography`, `Tooltip`, `Table`, `Form`, custom components), especially when rendering user-provided data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it within Ant Design Pro components.
    *   Utilize React's JSX syntax, which automatically escapes values to prevent XSS.
    *   Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. If used, rigorously sanitize the input using a trusted library like DOMPurify.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices for React and Ant Design Pro, emphasizing XSS prevention.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Example Code Misuse](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_example_code_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Developers directly copy and paste authentication example code from Ant Design Pro documentation or examples without proper security review and customization. This example code might contain vulnerabilities or be insufficient for production security requirements, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, and application functionalities. This can lead to data breaches, account takeover, and system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**  Authentication modules, login forms, session management logic, potentially related to `UserLayout` or example authentication flows.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat Ant Design Pro authentication examples as starting points and not production-ready solutions.
    *   Thoroughly review and customize authentication logic to meet specific application security requirements.
    *   Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Follow security best practices for password handling, session management, and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Conduct security testing and code reviews of authentication implementation.

## Threat: [Data Injection via Forms and Tables](./threats/data_injection_via_forms_and_tables.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates form inputs or data displayed in tables to inject malicious data into the application. This could be through SQL injection if form data is used in database queries without proper sanitization, or through command injection if form data is used in system commands. In tables, improper handling of user-controlled data could lead to XSS.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized data modification, application compromise, SQL injection, command injection, and Cross-Site Scripting.
*   **Affected Component:**  `Form` component, `Table` component, data handling logic, server-side data processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side validation for all data submitted through Ant Design Pro forms.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Avoid executing system commands based on user-provided data. If necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate input.
    *   Sanitize and encode data displayed in Ant Design Pro tables to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation on both client-side (for user experience) and server-side (for security).

## Threat: [Outdated Framework Version Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_framework_version_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of Ant Design Pro, making it vulnerable to known security flaws that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities by targeting the specific outdated version.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities leading to various security breaches, including Remote Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting, Denial of Service, and information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version.
*   **Affected Component:**  Core Ant Design Pro framework, all components and modules within the framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Ant Design Pro to the latest stable version using `npm update ant-design-pro` or `yarn upgrade ant-design-pro`.
    *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for Ant Design Pro to stay informed about security updates and patches.
    *   Establish a process for promptly applying security updates to Ant Design Pro and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage versions of Ant Design Pro and its dependencies.
