# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: To provide a ready-to-use, enterprise-grade admin dashboard template that accelerates the development of internal tools, management systems, and other web applications.
  - Priority: Rapid application development and consistent user experience across different applications within an organization.
  - Priority: Maintainability and scalability of applications built using the template.
  - Priority: User-friendly interface and good user experience for administrative tasks.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the template itself could be inherited by all applications built using it, leading to widespread security issues.
  - Risk: Misconfiguration or misuse of the template by developers could introduce security vulnerabilities in deployed applications.
  - Risk: Lack of proper customization and security hardening of applications built with the template could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.
  - Risk: Dependency on external libraries and components (Node.js, React, Ant Design) introduces supply chain risks.
  - Risk: Outdated template or dependencies could lead to compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - assumed to be in place for the development of `ant-design-pro` itself by the maintainers, although details are not explicitly provided in the repository. (Location: Assumed within Ant Design Pro development process)
  - security control: Dependency Management - package-lock.json and yarn.lock files are used to manage dependencies, helping to ensure consistent builds and potentially mitigate some supply chain risks. (Location: Repository files)
  - security control: Code Reviews - assumed to be part of the development process for `ant-design-pro` contributions, although not explicitly documented. (Location: Assumed within Ant Design Pro development process)
  - security control: Static Code Analysis - linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) are likely used to maintain code quality and potentially catch some basic security issues. (Location: Development environment, potentially CI/CD pipelines)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions and open-source nature means vulnerabilities might be discovered and patched reactively rather than proactively.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications built using the template is ultimately the responsibility of the developers implementing those applications.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for applications built using `ant-design-pro`.
  - security control: Conduct regular dependency vulnerability scanning and updates for both the template and applications built with it.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation specifically for developers using `ant-design-pro` to build applications.
  - security control: Implement a process for security incident reporting and response for applications built using the template.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate security audits and penetration testing for applications built using `ant-design-pro`.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Applications built with `ant-design-pro` must implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
    - Requirement: Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for enhanced security.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of authentication credentials (e.g., using hashed passwords or token-based authentication).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Applications must implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to different features and data based on roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be implemented to simplify authorization management.
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced, granting users only the necessary permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs must be validated on both the client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    - Requirement: Input validation should include checks for data type, format, length, and allowed characters.
    - Requirement: Proper encoding and sanitization of user inputs before displaying them in the UI or storing them in the database.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
    - Requirement: HTTPS should be enforced for all communication between the client and server.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and avoid hardcoding them in the application code.
    - Requirement: Consider using encryption for sensitive data stored in local storage or cookies.
