# Vulnerability Assessment Results

Based on the thorough analysis of the VSCode EditorConfig extension, no high-severity vulnerabilities related to RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection were identified. The extension appears to be well-designed from a security perspective, processing untrusted repository content safely without creating opportunities for code execution.

The analysis covered all critical code paths including:
- Processing of .editorconfig files
- Template selection and generation
- Workspace configuration handling
- Text transformation operations

All these components handle untrusted input through safe VSCode APIs and deterministic transformations that don't involve dynamic evaluation or command construction.

This assessment concludes that a malicious repository with manipulated content would not be able to trigger remote code execution, command injection, or code injection vulnerabilities through this extension as currently implemented.
