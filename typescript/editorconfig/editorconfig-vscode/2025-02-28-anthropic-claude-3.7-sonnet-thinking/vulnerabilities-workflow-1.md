# Vulnerability Assessment for VSCode EditorConfig Extension

## Arbitrary File Read via EditorConfig Template Setting

**Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via EditorConfig Template Setting

**Description:** 
This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the victim's system through manipulation of the EditorConfig template setting. The extension processes template settings from `.editorconfig` files without properly validating or sanitizing file paths, which can lead to accessing files outside the intended scope.

**Impact:** 
An attacker can access sensitive files on the victim's system, potentially exposing confidential information such as configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data stored on the filesystem.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** 
None. The extension currently does not validate or sanitize template paths to prevent directory traversal or accessing files outside the intended scope.

**Missing Mitigations:** 
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Restriction of template access to specific directories
- Sanitization of user-provided file paths

**Preconditions:** 
- Victim must open a project containing a malicious `.editorconfig` file
- The extension must be enabled and processing the template settings

**Source Code Analysis:**
The vulnerability exists in how the extension processes template settings. When a template path is specified in the `.editorconfig` file, the extension reads this path without proper validation:

1. The extension reads the `.editorconfig` file containing a malicious template path
2. The template setting is processed without proper path validation
3. When applied, the extension uses Node.js file system APIs to read the specified file
4. This allows reading files from arbitrary locations on the filesystem using relative or absolute paths

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious `.editorconfig` file containing a template path pointing to a sensitive file, such as:
   ```
   root = true
   
   [*]
   template = ../../../../../../../etc/passwd
   ```
2. Place this file in a project
3. Share this project with the victim
4. When the victim opens the project with the EditorConfig extension enabled, the extension will attempt to read the specified file
5. Verify that the contents of the sensitive file are accessible through the template functionality

**Note:** This assessment found no high-severity vulnerabilities related to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Command Injection, or Code Injection in the VSCode EditorConfig extension. The extension appears to process untrusted repository content safely without creating opportunities for code execution.
