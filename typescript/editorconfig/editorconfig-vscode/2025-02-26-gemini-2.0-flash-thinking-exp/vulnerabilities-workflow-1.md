### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Read via EditorConfig Template Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker prepares a malicious workspace (for example, through a malicious repository or by providing a tampered `.vscode/settings.json`).
    2. The attacker adds a `.vscode/settings.json` file to the workspace or modifies the user settings.
    3. In the settings, the attacker sets the `editorconfig.template` setting to an absolute path pointing to a sensitive file on the user's system (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows, or any other file accessible by the VSCode process).
    4. The user opens this untrusted workspace in VSCode, or the malicious setting is applied to the user settings.
    5. The extension, configured to work in workspaces (including untrusted ones), picks up the malicious configuration.
    6. When the user triggers the “Generate .editorconfig” command, either manually from the command palette or context menu in the Explorer panel, or if it's triggered by another extension using the extension's API, the `EditorConfig.generate` command is executed.
    7. The `generateEditorConfig` function retrieves the `editorconfig.template` setting from the workspace or user configuration.
    8. The extension reads the `editorconfig.template` setting, which now points to the attacker-controlled file path.
    9. The extension uses `fs.readFile` to read the file from the path specified in the `editorconfig.template` setting without proper validation or sanitization.
    10. The content of the attacker-specified file is then written into a new `.editorconfig` file in the workspace root, effectively disclosing sensitive local file data.
- Impact:
    - High: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the user's system that the VSCode process has access to. This can include sensitive information like configuration files, source code, credentials, system configuration, or other private data. The sensitive file content becomes available to the user or any party that later views the generated `.editorconfig` file. This exposure could lead to further system compromise or data leakage.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There is no validation or sanitization of the configured `editorconfig.template` value in the extension’s command handler. The code simply checks whether the string equals `"default"` (using a case‑insensitive regular expression) but does not verify that any non‑default value is safe to use. The code directly uses the user-provided template path without validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path sanitization and validation for the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    - Restrict template paths to be within the extension's installation directory, workspace's directory, or a predefined safe location.
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed template file paths or require that only the bundled default template be used unless an explicit and secure escape is provided.
    - User Confirmation: Prompt the user for explicit confirmation if a custom template file is to be used, warning that its content will be inserted into a new configuration file.
    - Implement proper error handling and prevent writing the content of arbitrary files into the `.editorconfig` file.
    - Consider using `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile` with URI to enforce workspace scope, although the current use of `fs.readFile` bypasses URI based access control.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify VSCode workspace settings or user settings where `editorconfig.template` is defined. This can be achieved if the attacker prepares a malicious workspace (e.g., through a malicious repository or by providing a tampered `.vscode/settings.json`) or if another vulnerable extension allows settings injection.
    - The workspace must be untrusted (or controlled by an external attacker) so that the attacker can supply a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` (or other means to override extension configuration). Workspace settings must be configured to override user settings for `editorconfig.template` (default behavior).
    - The user must execute the `EditorConfig.generate` command after the attacker has modified the settings, either manually or via another extension.
    - The file specified by the attacker must be accessible on the victim’s file system by the VSCode process.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts`
    - Function: `generateEditorConfig(uri: Uri)`
    - Line 70: `const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'` - Retrieves the template path from configuration using `workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig').get<string>('template')`.
    - Line 77-80:
      ```typescript
      try {
          templateBuffer = await readFile(
              /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template,
          )
      } catch (error) { ... }
      ```
      - If `template` is not 'default' (checked by `/^default$/i.test(template)`), the value of `template` from settings is directly passed to `readFile`. `defaultTemplatePath` is used if `template` is 'default'.
      - `readFile` function (imported as `_readFile` from `fs` and promisified) will attempt to read the file from the path provided in `template` without any sanitization or validation.
      - Visualization:
        ```
        User/Workspace Settings (editorconfig.template) --> [generateEditorConfig] --> readFile(template) --> File System Access --> Write to .editorconfig
        ```
    - Code Snippet:
        ```typescript
        import { readFile as _readFile } from 'fs'
        // ...
        const readFile = promisify(_readFile)

        export async function generateEditorConfig(uri: Uri) {
            // ...
            async function writeFile() {
                const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')
                const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'
                const defaultTemplatePath = resolve(
                    __dirname,
                    '..',
                    'DefaultTemplate.editorconfig',
                )

                let templateBuffer: Buffer
                try {
                    templateBuffer = await readFile(
                        /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template, // Vulnerable line: readFile with unsanitized path from settings
                    )
                } catch (error) {
                    // ... error handling
                }

                try {
                    workspace.fs.writeFile(editorConfigUri, templateBuffer) // Write content to .editorconfig
                } catch (error) {
                    // ... error handling
                }
                return
            }
            writeFile();
            // ...
        }
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure you have write access to your VSCode user settings file or you are able to create/modify workspace settings.
    2. **Create Malicious Workspace (if testing workspace settings)**: Create a new directory named `test-workspace`. Inside `test-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
    3. **Modify VSCode Settings**: Open the `settings.json` file (either user settings or workspace settings created in step 2). Add or modify the `editorconfig.template` setting to point to a sensitive file on your system. For example, for Linux/macOS:
       ```json
       "editorconfig.template": "/etc/passwd"
       ```
       For Windows:
       ```json
       "editorconfig.template": "C:\\Windows\\win.ini"
       ```
       (Note: Adjust the path as needed based on your OS and VSCode settings location to reach the desired sensitive file.)
    4. **Open Workspace (if used workspace settings)**: Open VSCode and open the `test-workspace` folder.
    5. **Execute Generate Command**: In VSCode, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute the command `EditorConfig: Generate .editorconfig`, or right-click in the Explorer panel within the workspace root directory and select "Generate .editorconfig" from the context menu.
    6. **Check Generated .editorconfig**: After the command executes, open the newly created `.editorconfig` file in the root of `test-workspace`.
    7. **Verify File Content**: Verify that the `.editorconfig` file contains the content of the targeted sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`). If the `.editorconfig` file contains the content of the sensitive file, the arbitrary file read vulnerability is confirmed. Alternatively, observe the error message displayed by VSCode. If the vulnerability is present, and the targeted file is readable by the VSCode process, the error message might contain part of the file content or an error indicating file access issues, which still confirms path traversal attempt. If correctly mitigated, it should fail to read the file due to path validation and not expose file content or attempt to access outside allowed paths.
    8. **Document Results**: Document the steps and results to confirm that the extension performed an arbitrary file read based solely on an unsanitized configuration value.
