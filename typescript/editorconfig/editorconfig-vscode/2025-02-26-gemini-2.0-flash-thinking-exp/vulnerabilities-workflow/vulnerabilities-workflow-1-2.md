- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via EditorConfig Template Injection
- **Description:**  
  A malicious workspace can override the extension’s default template selection by setting the configuration key `editorconfig.template` to an arbitrary file path. When a user later invokes the “Generate .editorconfig” command, the extension reads the file from the supplied path (instead of using the bundled default template) and writes its content into the workspace’s `.editorconfig` file. This allows an attacker to disclose the contents of any locally accessible file.  
  **Step by step trigger:**
  1. An attacker prepares a workspace (for example, through a malicious repository or by providing a tampered `.vscode/settings.json`) that sets `"editorconfig.template": "/path/to/sensitive/file"` (e.g. `/etc/passwd` on UNIX-like systems or another sensitive file on Windows).
  2. The user opens this untrusted workspace in VSCode.
  3. The extension, which is configured to work in untrusted workspaces, picks up the malicious configuration.
  4. When the user triggers the “Generate .editorconfig” command (via the context menu or command palette), the extension reads the file specified by the attacker.
  5. The file’s content is then written into a new `.editorconfig` file in the workspace—effectively disclosing sensitive local file data.
  
- **Impact:**  
  The sensitive file content (which may include credentials, system configuration, or other private data) becomes available to the user or any party that later views the generated `.editorconfig` file. This exposure could lead to further system compromise or data leakage.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  There is no validation or sanitization of the configured `editorconfig.template` value in the extension’s command handler. The code simply checks whether the string equals `"default"` (using a case‑insensitive regular expression) but does not verify that any non‑default value is safe to use.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - **Input Validation:** The extension should validate that any non‑default `template` value is confined to an expected, safe directory (for example, limiting it to files within the extension’s installation directory).  
  - **Whitelisting:** Introduce a whitelist of allowed template file paths or require that only the bundled default template be used unless an explicit and secure escape is provided.  
  - **User Confirmation:** Prompt the user for explicit confirmation if a custom template file is to be used, warning that its content will be inserted into a new configuration file.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The workspace must be untrusted (or controlled by an external attacker) so that the attacker can supply a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` (or other means to override extension configuration).
  - The user must trigger the “Generate .editorconfig” command so that the extension attempts to read the file from the unsanitized path.
  - The file specified by the attacker must be accessible on the victim’s file system.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In the file `/code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts`, the command handler `generateEditorConfig` is registered for the command `EditorConfig.generate`.  
  2. The function first retrieves the workspace configuration using:
     - `const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')`
  3. It then reads the template setting:
     - `const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'`
  4. The code checks if the supplied template is equal to `"default"` using a regular expression:
     - `/^default$/i.test(template)`
  5. If the template is not `"default"`, it directly calls:
     - `templateBuffer = await readFile( /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template )`
  6. Because **no further validation or sanitization** is applied to the non‑default value of `template`, an attacker’s supplied file path may be read.
  7. Finally, the file’s contents are written into the workspace’s `.editorconfig` file using:
     - `workspace.fs.writeFile(editorConfigUri, templateBuffer)`
  8. This flow allows an attacker-controlled value from the workspace configuration to determine the file read and the subsequent file write.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  **Objective:** Prove that a malicious workspace configuration can cause the extension to read an arbitrary file and write its content into the generated `.editorconfig` file.
  
  **Test Steps:**
  1. Create (or modify) a workspace such that its settings file (e.g. `.vscode/settings.json`) includes a malicious configuration:
     - ```json
       {
         "editorconfig.template": "/absolute/path/to/a/test-file.txt"
       }
       ```
     (For testing, use a known file with identifiable content.)
  2. Open this workspace with VSCode running the extension.
  3. Manually trigger the “Generate .editorconfig” command from the context menu or the command palette.
  4. Verify that a new `.editorconfig` file is created in the workspace root.
  5. Open the newly generated `.editorconfig` file and confirm that its content exactly matches the content of the file specified in the malicious configuration.
  6. Document the steps and results to confirm that the extension performed an arbitrary file read based solely on an unsanitized configuration value.
