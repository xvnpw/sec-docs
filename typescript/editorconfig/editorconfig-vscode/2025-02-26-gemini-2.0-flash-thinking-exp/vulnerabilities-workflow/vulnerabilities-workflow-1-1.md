### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Template Path for .editorconfig Generation
- Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the VSCode settings for `editorconfig.template`.
    2. The `EditorConfig.generate` command is executed, either manually by the user or triggered by another extension if it uses the extension's API.
    3. The `generateEditorConfig` function reads the `editorconfig.template` setting to determine the template file path.
    4. If the `editorconfig.template` setting is not set to 'default', the function directly uses the provided string as a file path in the `readFile` function without proper validation or sanitization.
    5. By setting `editorconfig.template` to a path like '../../../sensitive/file', an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system when the `EditorConfig.generate` command is executed.
- Impact:
    - High: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the user's system that the VSCode process has access to. This can include sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or credentials if they are accessible.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses the user-provided template path without validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path sanitization and validation for the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    - Restrict template paths to be within the extension's or workspace's directory.
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed template names or paths.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify VSCode user settings or workspace settings where `editorconfig.template` is defined. This can be achieved if the attacker has write access to the user's settings file or if another vulnerable extension allows settings injection.
    - The user must execute the `EditorConfig.generate` command after the attacker has modified the settings.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts`
    - Function: `generateEditorConfig(uri: Uri)`
    - Line 70: `const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'` - Retrieves the template path from configuration.
    - Line 77:
      ```typescript
      try {
          templateBuffer = await readFile(
              /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template,
          )
      } catch (error) { ... }
      ```
      - If `template` is not 'default', the value of `template` from settings is directly passed to `readFile`.
      - `readFile` function from `fs` (via `promisify`) will attempt to read the file from the path provided in `template` without any sanitization.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      User Settings (editorconfig.template) --> [generateEditorConfig] --> readFile(template) --> File System Access
      ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure you have write access to your VSCode user settings file (usually `settings.json` in your user data directory).
    2. **Modify VSCode Settings**: Open your VSCode settings (JSON). Add or modify the `editorconfig.template` setting to point to a sensitive file on your system, for example:
       ```json
       "editorconfig.template": "../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
       ```
       (Note: The number of `../` might need adjustment based on your OS and VSCode settings location to reach the root directory and then `/etc/passwd`. For Windows, try something like `editorconfig.template": "../../../../../../../../../../../../Windows/win.ini"`).
    3. **Execute Generate Command**: In VSCode, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute the command `EditorConfig: Generate .editorconfig`.
    4. **Check Error Message**: Observe the error message displayed by VSCode. If the vulnerability is present, and the targeted file is readable by the VSCode process, the error message might contain the content of the `/etc/passwd` file (or `win.ini` for Windows) or an error indicating file access issues, which still confirms path traversal attempt. If correctly mitigated, it should fail to read the file due to path validation and not expose file content or attempt to access outside allowed paths.
