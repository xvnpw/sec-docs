### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary File Read via Template Path in Generate EditorConfig Command

* Description:
    1. An attacker prepares a malicious workspace.
    2. The attacker adds a `.vscode/settings.json` file to the workspace.
    3. In the `.vscode/settings.json`, the attacker sets the `editorconfig.template` setting to an absolute path pointing to a sensitive file on the user's system (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows).
    4. The user opens this malicious workspace in VSCode.
    5. The user right-clicks in the Explorer panel within the workspace root directory.
    6. The user selects "Generate .editorconfig" from the context menu.
    7. The `EditorConfig.generate` command is executed.
    8. The extension reads the `editorconfig.template` setting from the workspace configuration, which now points to the attacker-controlled file path.
    9. The extension uses `fs.readFile` to read the file from the path specified in the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    10. The content of the attacker-specified file is written into the newly generated `.editorconfig` file within the workspace.
    11. The attacker can then retrieve the contents of the sensitive file by accessing the generated `.editorconfig` file within the workspace if they have access to the workspace (e.g., if the user shares the workspace or if it's in a shared location).

* Impact:
    An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system if the VSCode extension process has sufficient permissions. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or personal data, depending on the files the user has access to and the attacker specifies in the `editorconfig.template` setting.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The extension directly uses the user-provided path from the `editorconfig.template` setting in the `generateEditorConfig` command without any validation or sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Validate and sanitize the `template` path obtained from the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    - Restrict file access to only files within the workspace or the extension's own resources.
    - Implement proper error handling and prevent writing the content of arbitrary files into the `.editorconfig` file.
    - Consider using `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile` with URI to enforce workspace scope, although `fs.readFile` is used here which bypasses the URI based access control.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must open a malicious workspace prepared by the attacker in VSCode.
    - The malicious workspace must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the `editorconfig.template` setting to a path of a file the attacker wants to read.
    - The user must execute the "Generate .editorconfig" command within the malicious workspace.
    - Workspace settings must be configured to override user settings for `editorconfig.template` (default behavior).

* Source code analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts

    import { readFile as _readFile } from 'fs'
    // ...
    const readFile = promisify(_readFile)

    export async function generateEditorConfig(uri: Uri) {
        // ...
        async function writeFile() {
            const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')
            const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'
            const defaultTemplatePath = resolve(
                __dirname,
                '..',
                'DefaultTemplate.editorconfig',
            )

            let templateBuffer: Buffer
            try {
                templateBuffer = await readFile(
                    /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template, // Vulnerable line: readFile with unsanitized path from settings
                )
            } catch (error) {
                // ... error handling
            }

            try {
                workspace.fs.writeFile(editorConfigUri, templateBuffer) // Write content to .editorconfig
            } catch (error) {
                // ... error handling
            }
            return
        }
        writeFile();
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The `generateEditorConfig` function in `/code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts` retrieves the `template` setting from the workspace configuration. If the template is not 'default', it directly passes the setting value to the `readFile` function without any validation. This allows an attacker to control the file path read by the extension by manipulating the workspace settings. The content read from the attacker-specified path is then written to the `.editorconfig` file in the workspace using `workspace.fs.writeFile`.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a new directory named `test-workspace`.
    2. Inside `test-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "editorconfig.template": "/etc/passwd"
        }
        ```
        (For Windows, use `C:\\Windows\\win.ini` or similar accessible sensitive file).
    4. Open VSCode and open the `test-workspace` folder.
    5. In the Explorer panel, right-click on the `test-workspace` folder or any location within it.
    6. Select "Generate .editorconfig".
    7. After the command executes, open the newly created `.editorconfig` file in the root of `test-workspace`.
    8. Verify that the `.editorconfig` file contains the content of `/etc/passwd` (or `C:\Windows\win.ini` if testing on Windows). If the `.editorconfig` file contains the content of the sensitive file, the arbitrary file read vulnerability is confirmed.
