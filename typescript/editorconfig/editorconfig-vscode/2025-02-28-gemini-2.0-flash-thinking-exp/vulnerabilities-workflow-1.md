### Arbitrary File Read via User-Configurable Template Path in `generateEditorConfig` command

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via User-Configurable Template Path in `generateEditorConfig` command

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can configure the `editorconfig.template` setting in VSCode to point to an arbitrary file path on the user's file system. This setting is user-configurable and can be influenced if a user opens a workspace provided by an attacker, as workspace settings can override user settings.
    2. The user then executes the "Generate .editorconfig" command. This can be done either through the command palette or by right-clicking in the explorer context menu and selecting "Generate .editorconfig".
    3. The extension's `generateEditorConfig` command retrieves the template file path from the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    4. The extension then uses the `readFile` function to read the file specified by the `editorconfig.template` setting.
    5. If the attacker sets `editorconfig.template` to a sensitive file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `C:\secrets.txt`, `C:\Windows\win.ini`), the extension will attempt to read the content of that file.
    6. While the content is not directly displayed in the editor, any error messages resulting from attempting to parse a non-`.editorconfig` file as a template might reveal information about the file read attempt. In a more sophisticated attack, the attacker might craft a valid `.editorconfig` file at an arbitrary path to influence extension behavior in unexpected ways or observe timing differences to confirm file existence and read access. This can lead to arbitrary file read, where an attacker can read sensitive files on the user's system that the VSCode process has access to.

- **Impact:**
    High. An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's file system that the VSCode process has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, credentials, or source code.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None. The extension directly uses the user-provided template path without any validation or sanitization.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the `editorconfig.template` setting to ensure it points to a file within a safe, predefined location, such as the extension's own directory or a designated template folder.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize the user-provided path to prevent path traversal attacks.
    - Restrict file access: Implement checks to ensure that the extension only attempts to read files that are intended to be used as templates and are within allowed locations.
    - Consider using predefined templates or sandboxing file access to prevent path traversal.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. Attacker-controlled VSCode settings: The attacker needs to be able to influence the user's VSCode settings, specifically the `editorconfig.template` setting. This could be achieved if the user opens a workspace provided by the attacker, as workspace settings can override user settings. This can also be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify user settings.
    2. User action: The user must execute the "Generate .editorconfig" command, either through the command palette or context menu.

- **Source code analysis:**
    ```typescript
    File: /code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts
    ...
    async function writeFile() {
        const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')
        const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default' // User-configurable template path
        const defaultTemplatePath = resolve(
            __dirname,
            '..',
            'DefaultTemplate.editorconfig',
        )

        let templateBuffer: Buffer
        try {
            templateBuffer = await readFile(
                /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template, // readFile uses user-controlled path
            )
        } catch (error) {
        ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the `readFile` function call within `generateEditorConfig.ts`.
    - **Step 1**: The `generateEditorConfig` function is called when the `EditorConfig.generate` command is executed.
    - **Step 2**: The function retrieves the template path from the configuration:
        ```typescript
        const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')
        const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default'
        ```
    - **Step 3**: If the template is not 'default', the code attempts to read the file at the provided `template` path using `readFile`:
        ```typescript
        templateBuffer = await readFile(
            /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template,
        )
        ```
        - **Visualization:**
          ```
          User Input (editorconfig.template setting) --> template variable --> readFile() function
          ```
    - **Step 4**: The `readFile` function from the `fs` module is used directly with the user-provided `template` path. There is no validation or sanitization of the `template` path before it's passed to `readFile`.
    - **Step 5**: If an attacker can control the `editorconfig.template` setting and set it to a path like `/etc/passwd` or `../../../sensitive/file`, the `readFile` function will attempt to read these files. The `template` variable, sourced directly from the user-configurable `editorconfig.template` setting, is used as the file path for `readFile`. There is no validation or sanitization of this path, allowing an attacker to specify any accessible file path.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Install the EditorConfig extension in VSCode.
    2. Open VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings).
    3. Search for "editorconfig.template".
    4. In the "EditorConfig â€º Generate: Template" setting, enter a path to a sensitive file on your system, for example:
        - On Linux/macOS: `/etc/passwd`
        - On Windows: `C:\Windows\win.ini` or `C:\secrets.txt`
    5. Open any workspace folder in VSCode.
    6. Open the command palette (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute the command "EditorConfig: Generate .editorconfig". Alternatively, right-click on the workspace folder in the Explorer sidebar and select "Generate .editorconfig".
    7. After executing the command, a `.editorconfig` file may be created in the workspace root.
    8. Observe the behavior of the extension. If the command fails, check the error message in VSCode's developer console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console) or the "EditorConfig" output channel (View > Output, then select "EditorConfig" from the dropdown). The error message might contain parts of the content of the file you tried to read, or indicate a failed attempt to parse the file as an EditorConfig template. If the command succeeds unexpectedly, it still indicates a successful read of the arbitrary file, confirming the vulnerability.
    9. If a `.editorconfig` file is created, open the newly created `.editorconfig` file and verify its content. If the vulnerability is present, the `.editorconfig` file may contain the content of the file specified in the "Editorconfig: Template" setting (e.g., the content of `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`).
