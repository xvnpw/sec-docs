### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Read via User-Configurable Template Path in `generateEditorConfig` command
- Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `editorconfig.template` setting in VSCode to point to an arbitrary file path on the user's file system.
    2. The user then executes the "Generate .editorconfig" command, either through the command palette or the explorer context menu.
    3. The extension's `generateEditorConfig` command reads the file specified by the `editorconfig.template` setting using `readFile`.
    4. If the attacker sets `editorconfig.template` to a sensitive file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `C:\secrets.txt`), the extension will attempt to read the content of that file.
    5. While the content is not directly displayed in the editor, any error messages resulting from attempting to parse a non-`.editorconfig` file as a template might reveal information about the file read attempt. In a more sophisticated attack, the attacker might craft a valid `.editorconfig` file at an arbitrary path to influence extension behavior in unexpected ways or observe timing differences to confirm file existence and read access.
- Impact:
    High. An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's file system that the VSCode process has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, credentials, or source code.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The extension directly uses the user-provided template path without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the `editorconfig.template` setting to ensure it points to a file within a safe, predefined location, such as the extension's own directory or a designated template folder.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize the user-provided path to prevent path traversal attacks.
    - Restrict file access: Implement checks to ensure that the extension only attempts to read files that are intended to be used as templates and are within allowed locations.
- Preconditions:
    1. Attacker-controlled VSCode settings: The attacker needs to be able to influence the user's VSCode settings. This could be achieved if the user opens a workspace provided by the attacker, as workspace settings can override user settings.
    2. User action: The user must execute the "Generate .editorconfig" command.
- Source code analysis:
    ```typescript
    File: /code/src/commands/generateEditorConfig.ts
    ...
    async function writeFile() {
        const ec = workspace.getConfiguration('editorconfig')
        const template = ec.get<string>('template') || 'default' // User-configurable template path
        const defaultTemplatePath = resolve(
            __dirname,
            '..',
            'DefaultTemplate.editorconfig',
        )

        let templateBuffer: Buffer
        try {
            templateBuffer = await readFile(
                /^default$/i.test(template) ? defaultTemplatePath : template, // readFile uses user-controlled path
            )
        } catch (error) {
        ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the `readFile` function call within `generateEditorConfig.ts`. The `template` variable, sourced directly from the user-configurable `editorconfig.template` setting, is used as the file path for `readFile`. There is no validation or sanitization of this path, allowing an attacker to specify any accessible file path.

- Security test case:
    1. Install the EditorConfig extension in VSCode.
    2. Open VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings).
    3. Search for "editorconfig.template".
    4. In the "EditorConfig â€º Generate: Template" setting, enter a path to a sensitive file on your system, for example:
        - On Linux/macOS: `/etc/passwd`
        - On Windows: `C:\Windows\win.ini`
    5. Open any workspace folder in VSCode.
    6. Right-click on the workspace folder in the Explorer sidebar and select "Generate .editorconfig".
    7. Observe the behavior of the extension. If the command fails, check the error message in VSCode's developer console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console). The error message might contain parts of the content of the file you tried to read, or indicate a failed attempt to parse the file as an EditorConfig template. If the command succeeds unexpectedly (which is less likely with files like `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`), it still indicates a successful read of the arbitrary file, confirming the vulnerability.
