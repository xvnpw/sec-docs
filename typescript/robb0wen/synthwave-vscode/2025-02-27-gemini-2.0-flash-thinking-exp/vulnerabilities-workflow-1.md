## Combined Vulnerability List

This document consolidates the identified vulnerabilities for the Synthwave '84 VS Code Theme. After reviewing the provided reports, the following vulnerability has been identified and detailed:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe Modification of VS Code Core Files (Arbitrary Code Injection Risk)
  - **Description:**
    The extension’s “Neon Dreams” feature works by modifying VS Code’s core workbench HTML file to inject a custom script (neondreams.js) that applies the glow styles. This process is performed by reading internal files (using paths computed from `vscode.env.appRoot`), performing a series of string replacements, and then rewriting the workbench HTML file. An external attacker who is able to trigger the command (by, for example, tricking the user into invoking “synthwave84.enableNeon”) may be able to influence or tamper with the files that are read from disk or the content that gets written. Since the extension does not verify the integrity of the VS Code core files before modifying them or authenticate the source of the injected content, any ability (or supply-chain compromise) that lets an attacker control the bundled files (such as `editor_chrome.css` or `theme_template.js`) would enable injection of arbitrary JavaScript into the VS Code environment.

    **Step-by-step potential attack vector:**
    1. An attacker persuades a user (or leverages another exploit) to execute the “Enable Neon Dreams” command.
    2. Since the user’s VS Code installation is modified (by writing to a protected directory), the extension reads in its own internal resources (CSS and JS templates) and “injects” its changes into the core workbench HTML.
    3. Without validating that the workbench file is in an expected, untampered state—or that the bundled files have not been maliciously altered—the resulting output may include arbitrary code if an attacker has managed to replace or modify one of these resources.
    4. Once injected, the malicious JS code executes in the context of VS Code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code inside VS Code at launch. This may lead to a persistent compromise of the editor environment, exfiltration of sensitive data, or further escalation of privileges on the host machine. Because the changes affect VS Code’s core files, the attack could survive an update or be difficult to detect.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension checks whether the injection appears to have already been applied by scanning for the `"neondreams.js"` script tag in the HTML before writing new changes.
    - There is basic error handling (using try/catch) that detects common file system errors (such as `ENOENT`, `EACCES`, or `EPERM`) and informs the user to run VS Code with elevated privileges if needed.
    - The configuration values (such as brightness and disableGlow) are obtained from the workspace configuration and minimally sanitized (e.g. using `parseFloat` for brightness).

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Integrity Verification:** There is no check to verify that the VS Code workbench file is unmodified or in an approved state before injecting changes.
    - **Authentication/Digital Signing:** The injected content (i.e. the bundled JS and CSS files) is not digitally signed or verified, leaving open the possibility that a compromised extension package (or modifications introduced by another vector) could alter these files.
    - **Safe Update Method:** The extension directly writes to core VS Code files rather than using an approved VS Code API for theming/customization, increasing the risk of arbitrary code injection.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user has installed the SynthWave ’84 extension and chooses to enable Neon Dreams.
    - The user (or the environment) provides write access to the VS Code installation directory (for example, by running VS Code with administrator privileges on Windows or placing the installation in a writable location on Linux/Mac).
    - An attacker must be able to trigger the command (for example, via social engineering or leveraging another vulnerability) and, in a worst-case scenario, might also rely on a supply chain compromise that modifies the extension’s asset files.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In **/code/src/extension.js** the extension registers the command `"synthwave84.enableNeon"`.
    2. Upon invocation, it retrieves the user’s configuration (including `disableGlow` and `brightness`), ensuring that brightness is constrained between 0 and 1; however, no additional verification of these or other inputs is performed.
    3. The script then computes the path to the workbench HTML file by using `vscode.env.appRoot` and constructs the output path for `neondreams.js`.
    4. The extension reads internal resource files:
       - It reads the CSS from `__dirname + '/css/editor_chrome.css'`.
       - It reads the JavaScript theme template from `__dirname + '/js/theme_template.js'`.
    5. It replaces tokens in the template (e.g. `[DISABLE_GLOW]`, `[CHROME_STYLES]`, `[NEON_BRIGHTNESS]`) with corresponding runtime values.
    6. The final JS file is written out to the target location (inside the VS Code installation).
    7. Next, the extension reads the workbench HTML file, checks whether it already contains the `"neondreams.js"` script tag, and if not, injects the tag just before the closing `</html>`.
    8. The code does not perform any cryptographic or structural check on the contents of either the workbench HTML or the internal assets; an attacker with the ability to modify those could supply malicious replacements.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    **Objective:** Confirm that the “enableNeon” command modifies VS Code core files without verifying their integrity, thereby opening the door for arbitrary code injection.
    - **Preconditions:**
      - Use a test environment where VS Code’s installation directory is writable (e.g. running VS Code with administrator privileges on Windows).
      - The extension is installed in the test environment.
    - **Test Steps:**
      1. **Trigger the Command:**
         - Open VS Code.
         - Open the command palette and execute the `"synthwave84.enableNeon"` command.
      2. **Observe File Modification:**
         - Locate the workbench HTML file (for example, by checking the computed path from the extension’s log messages or by manually navigating to the VS Code installation directory).
         - Open the file and verify that the injected portion (a script tag referencing `"neondreams.js"`) appears just before the closing `</html>` tag.
      3. **Simulate Malicious Modification:**
         - In a controlled test, substitute the contents of `editor_chrome.css` or `theme_template.js` with a test payload (for example, injecting a benign `alert("Test Injection")` or a logging statement).
         - Re-run the `"synthwave84.enableNeon"` command and then reload VS Code.
      4. **Verify Execution:**
         - Check whether the test payload (e.g., the alert or log message) is executed within the VS Code environment, confirming that the injected content is active and has been accepted without additional verification.
    - **Expected Result:**
      - The workbench HTML file is modified (as observed in step 2).
      - The test payload replaces or augments the originally intended code, demonstrating that arbitrary modifications to system files via the extension are possible without any integrity check.
