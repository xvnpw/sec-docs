### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability: Potential VS Code Installation Corruption due to Non-Atomic File Modification
- Description:
    1. The extension attempts to modify the core VS Code file `workbench.html` to enable or disable the "Neon Dreams" feature.
    2. During the enable or disable process, the extension reads the content of `workbench.html` into memory.
    3. It then modifies this content in memory to inject or remove a script tag.
    4. Finally, the extension writes the modified content back to the original `workbench.html` file using `fs.writeFileSync`.
    5. If the `fs.writeFileSync` operation is interrupted or fails after the original file content has been read but before the modified content is completely written to disk (e.g., due to system crash, power loss, disk errors, or permission issues), the `workbench.html` file can be left in a corrupted or incomplete state.
    6. A corrupted `workbench.html` file can lead to VS Code malfunction, instability, or prevent VS Code from starting correctly.

- Impact: Corruption of the VS Code installation. In a worst-case scenario, this could render VS Code unusable and require the user to reinstall VS Code to restore functionality. This is a high impact as it disrupts the user's development environment and workflow, potentially leading to loss of productivity and requiring manual intervention to fix.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - There are no implemented mitigations in the code to prevent file corruption during the modification process.
    - The README.md file includes a disclaimer stating "VS code doesn't natively support text effects and as a result, the glow is experimental. It's likely to be buggy... If something go wrong, you can disable the glow... If for any reason you can't open VS Code, you can fix the issue with a fresh install of VS Code." This serves as a warning to the user but is not a technical mitigation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement proper error handling for file write operations using `fs.writeFileSync`. The current `try-catch` block in `extension.js` primarily handles file access errors but doesn't specifically address errors during the write operation itself that could lead to partial writes and file corruption.
    - Implement a backup mechanism before modifying `workbench.html`. This could involve creating a backup copy of the original `workbench.html` file before making any changes. If the modification process fails, the extension could attempt to restore the backup to revert `workbench.html` to its original state.
    - Consider using atomic file operations or file system utilities that provide transactional file writing to ensure that the write operation is either fully completed or not applied at all. While Node.js `fs` module doesn't offer built-in atomic write operations directly, libraries or OS-specific approaches for atomic file replacement could be explored.
- Preconditions:
    1. User has installed the Synthwave '84 extension.
    2. User attempts to enable or disable the "Neon Dreams" feature via the extension's commands ("Enable Neon Dreams" or "Disable Neon Dreams").
    3. A condition occurs that interrupts or causes failure during the `fs.writeFileSync` operation while modifying `workbench.html`. This could be due to:
        - Disk write errors.
        - Insufficient disk space.
        - File system permissions issues preventing complete write operation.
        - Unexpected termination of the VS Code process during the write operation (e.g., VS Code crash).
        - Concurrent access to `workbench.html` by another process interfering with the write operation.

- Source code analysis:
    1. In `extension.js`, both `enableNeon` and `disableNeon` commands contain the following code block for modifying `workbench.html`:
    ```javascript
    const htmlFile = path.join(base, electronBase, "workbench", workBenchFilename);
    const html = fs.readFileSync(htmlFile, "utf-8");
    // ... modification logic ...
    fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8");
    ```
    2. The code reads the entire `workbench.html` file into the `html` variable.
    3. It performs string replacements on the `html` content to inject or remove the script tag.
    4. It then uses `fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8")` to write the modified `output` back to the same `htmlFile` path.
    5. **Vulnerability:** `fs.writeFileSync` is not atomic. If the writing process is interrupted after the file header or part of the content is written, but before the entire content is flushed to disk, the `workbench.html` file will be corrupted.
    6. The `try-catch` block in `enableNeon` only handles exceptions at the beginning related to file path resolution or initial file access (`ENOENT|EACCES|EPERM`), but it does not specifically handle potential errors during the `fs.writeFileSync` operation itself that could lead to file corruption.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the "Synthwave '84" VS Code extension in a test VS Code instance.
        - Locate the `workbench.html` file for the VS Code instance (path will depend on OS and VS Code version, but can be derived from `extension.js` code).
        - Before running the test, ensure you have a backup of the original `workbench.html` in case of corruption.
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the command palette in VS Code and execute "Enable Neon Dreams".
        - **Simulate a write interruption during `fs.writeFileSync`**. This is the most challenging part of the test case and might require specific tools or techniques to reliably interrupt file I/O at a precise moment during the `fs.writeFileSync` call. Possible approaches could include:
            - **Resource exhaustion:** Fill up the disk space to near capacity just before executing the command, hoping that the write operation will fail mid-way due to lack of space.
            - **Permission manipulation (advanced):** Temporarily revoke write permissions to `workbench.html` for the VS Code process user right after the file read operation but before write operation completes, if OS allows such fine-grained control and timing.
            - **Process interruption (less reliable, but possible):** Attempt to abruptly terminate the VS Code process (e.g., sending SIGKILL signal) immediately after the `fs.writeFileSync` call begins but before it finishes. This is less precise and may not consistently corrupt the file, but it's a possible scenario to test.
    3. **Verify Corruption:**
        - After attempting to trigger the interruption in step 2, restart VS Code.
        - Observe VS Code's behavior upon restarting. Check for:
            - Error messages displayed during startup.
            - VS Code failing to start or crashing immediately after startup.
            - UI rendering issues or significant malfunctions in VS Code's functionality.
        - If VS Code exhibits any of these symptoms after the test, it indicates that `workbench.html` may have been corrupted due to the non-atomic file modification process, validating the vulnerability.
    4. **Cleanup:**
        - If `workbench.html` is corrupted, restore it from the backup created in step 1 to recover VS Code functionality.
        - Uninstall the Synthwave '84 extension if further testing is not needed.

Note: Reliably simulating a file write interruption for testing atomicity issues can be complex and may depend on the operating system and file system behavior. The test case aims to conceptually outline the steps to verify the potential for file corruption due to non-atomic writes.
