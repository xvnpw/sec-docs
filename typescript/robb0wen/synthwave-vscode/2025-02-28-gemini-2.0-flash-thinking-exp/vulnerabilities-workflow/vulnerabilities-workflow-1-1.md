* Vulnerability name: Modification of VSCode core files without explicit user consent

* Description:
1. User installs and activates the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension.
2. User executes the "Enable Neon Dreams" command from the command palette.
3. The extension, without further explicit user consent or detailed warning beyond the initial extension description, modifies the `workbench.html` file, a core component of VS Code.
4. This modification involves injecting a `<script>` tag into `workbench.html` to load and execute `neondreams.js`.
5. `neondreams.js` dynamically modifies the CSS styles of VS Code to apply the "neon glow" effect.
6. VS Code restarts to apply these changes, potentially displaying a "corrupted" warning due to the core file modification.
7. The user might experience instability or unexpected behavior in VS Code due to these modifications, and future VS Code updates might be disrupted or require re-application of the theme modifications.
8. An attacker could potentially exploit this pattern of modifying core files in a more malicious extension to perform harmful actions. While Synthwave '84 is benign, the precedent is set for core file modifications by extensions.

* Impact:
- High system instability of VS Code instance.
- Unexpected behavior of VS Code.
- Potential disruption of VS Code updates.
- Sets a precedent for extensions to modify core VS Code files, which could be exploited by malicious extensions for harmful purposes in other scenarios.
- Degraded user experience due to potential instability and "corrupted" warnings.

* Vulnerability rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
- The README.md file includes a "Disclaimer" section warning users about the experimental nature of the glow effect and the modification of internal VS Code files.
- The extension prompts the user to restart VS Code after enabling or disabling "Neon Dreams", making the file modification somewhat explicit.
- The extension provides commands to disable the glow effect and revert the changes.
- The extension checks if the script tag is already present before injecting it again, preventing redundant modifications.

* Missing mitigations:
- Lack of explicit user consent dialog *before* modifying `workbench.html`, explaining the risks and asking for confirmation. A simple "Do you want to proceed with modifying core VS Code files to enable Neon Dreams? This may cause instability and is not officially supported by VS Code." confirmation dialog would be beneficial.
- Insufficient in-app warnings about the risks of modifying core files. The current warning is only in the README and a brief message after enabling.
- No built-in mechanism to automatically revert changes upon VS Code updates or in case of errors during modification.
- No integrity check or backup mechanism for `workbench.html` before modification to easily revert to the original state if needed.

* Preconditions:
- User must have VS Code installed.
- User must install the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension.
- User must execute the "Enable Neon Dreams" command.
- User needs write permissions to the VS Code installation directory to allow file modifications. On Windows, administrator privileges might be required.

* Source code analysis:
1. `src/extension.js` - The `activate` function registers commands `synthwave84.enableNeon` and `synthwave84.disableNeon`.
2. `src/extension.js` - Inside `synthwave84.enableNeon`, the code determines the path to `workbench.html`:
   ```javascript
   const appDir = path.dirname(vscode.env.appRoot);
   const base = path.join(appDir,'app','out','vs','code');
   const electronBase = isVSCodeBelowVersion("1.70.0") ? "electron-browser" : "electron-sandbox";
   const workBenchFilename = vscode.version == "1.94.0" ? "workbench.esm.html" : "workbench.html";
   const htmlFile = path.join(base, electronBase, "workbench", workBenchFilename);
   ```
   This code constructs the path to `workbench.html` based on VS Code's installation directory and version.
3. `src/extension.js` - It reads the content of `workbench.html` and checks for existing Synthwave script tag:
   ```javascript
   const html = fs.readFileSync(htmlFile, "utf-8");
   const isEnabled = html.includes("neondreams.js");
   ```
4. `src/extension.js` - If the script tag is not present, it removes any existing tag and injects a new one:
   ```javascript
   if (!isEnabled) {
       let output = html.replace(/^.*(<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"><\/script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->).*\n?/mg, '');
       output = html.replace(/\<\/html\>/g, `	<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"></script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->\n`);
       output += '</html>';
       fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8");
       // ... restart prompt ...
   }
   ```
   This code directly modifies the content of `workbench.html` by adding a script tag.
5. `src/extension.js` - The `fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8");` line writes the modified content back to the `workbench.html` file, directly altering a core VS Code file.
6. `src/extension.js` - Similar logic is used in `synthwave84.disableNeon` to remove the injected script tag.

* Security test case:
1. Install VS Code.
2. Install the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
3. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Shift+Cmd+P).
4. Execute the command "Enable Neon Dreams".
5. Observe that VS Code prompts to restart. Restart VS Code.
6. After restart, check the VS Code installation directory for `workbench.html` (the exact path depends on the OS and VS Code version, but can be found by inspecting `vscode.env.appRoot` in the extension's code during debugging or by searching for `workbench.html` in the VS Code installation directory).
7. Open `workbench.html` in a text editor.
8. Verify that a script tag `<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"></script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->` has been injected into the `workbench.html` file, typically just before the `</html>` tag.
9. Open the command palette again and execute "Disable Neon Dreams".
10. Restart VS Code when prompted.
11. Re-open `workbench.html` and verify that the injected script tag has been removed.
12. Observe if VS Code shows any "corrupted" warnings after enabling and disabling "Neon Dreams". Note that this warning is expected behavior due to core file modification.
13. Try updating VS Code after enabling "Neon Dreams". Observe if the theme modifications are still applied or if VS Code behaves unexpectedly after the update. This can demonstrate potential instability or update disruption.

This test case proves that the extension directly modifies `workbench.html`, a core VS Code file, by injecting a script tag, confirming the vulnerability.
