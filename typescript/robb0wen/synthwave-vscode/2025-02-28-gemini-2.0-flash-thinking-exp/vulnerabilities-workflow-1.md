## Vulnerability List

### 1. Modification of VSCode Core Files Without Explicit User Consent and Potential VS Code Installation Corruption

* **Vulnerability Name:** Modification of VSCode core files without explicit user consent and potential VS Code installation corruption

* **Description:**
    1. User installs and activates the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension.
    2. User executes the "Enable Neon Dreams" command from the command palette.
    3. The extension, without further explicit user consent dialog *before* the action, modifies the `workbench.html` file, a core component of VS Code.
    4. This modification involves injecting a `<script>` tag into `workbench.html` to load and execute `neondreams.js`.
    5. `neondreams.js` dynamically modifies the CSS styles of VS Code to apply the "neon glow" effect.
    6. VS Code restarts to apply these changes, potentially displaying a "corrupted" warning due to the core file modification.
    7. If the `fs.writeFileSync` operation during modification is interrupted or fails (e.g., system crash, power loss), the `workbench.html` file can be left in a corrupted state.
    8. A corrupted `workbench.html` file can lead to VS Code malfunction, instability, or prevent VS Code from starting correctly, potentially requiring a reinstallation of VS Code.
    9. The user might experience instability or unexpected behavior in VS Code due to these modifications, and future VS Code updates might be disrupted or require re-application of the theme modifications.
    10. An attacker could potentially exploit this pattern of modifying core files in a more malicious extension to perform harmful actions. While Synthwave '84 is benign, the precedent is set for core file modifications by extensions.

* **Impact:**
    - High system instability of VS Code instance.
    - Unexpected behavior of VS Code.
    - Potential disruption of VS Code updates.
    - Corruption of the VS Code installation, potentially rendering it unusable and requiring reinstallation.
    - Sets a precedent for extensions to modify core VS Code files, which could be exploited by malicious extensions for harmful purposes in other scenarios.
    - Degraded user experience due to potential instability, "corrupted" warnings, and potential VS Code reinstallation.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `README.md` file includes a "Disclaimer" section warning users about the experimental nature of the glow effect, the modification of internal VS Code files, and potential issues, suggesting a fresh install in case of problems.
    - The extension prompts the user to restart VS Code after enabling or disabling "Neon Dreams", making the file modification somewhat explicit in terms of requiring a restart.
    - The extension provides commands to disable the glow effect and revert the changes by removing the injected script tag.
    - The extension checks if the script tag is already present before injecting it again, preventing redundant modifications.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Lack of explicit user consent dialog *before* modifying `workbench.html`, explaining the risks of core file modification (instability, potential corruption, unsupported nature) and asking for confirmation. A clear confirmation dialog is needed, for example: "Do you want to proceed with modifying core VS Code files to enable Neon Dreams? This may cause instability, potential corruption and is not officially supported by VS Code."
    - Insufficient in-app warnings about the risks of modifying core files. The current warning is only in the `README` and a brief message after enabling.
    - No built-in mechanism to automatically revert changes upon VS Code updates or in case of errors during modification.
    - No integrity check or backup mechanism for `workbench.html` before modification to easily revert to the original state if needed in case of corruption or other issues.
    - Lack of proper error handling for file write operations using `fs.writeFileSync` to prevent file corruption during modification.

* **Preconditions:**
    - User must have VS Code installed.
    - User must install the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension.
    - User must execute the "Enable Neon Dreams" command.
    - User needs write permissions to the VS Code installation directory to allow file modifications. On some operating systems, administrator privileges might be required for certain installation locations.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `src/extension.js` - The `activate` function registers commands `synthwave84.enableNeon` and `synthwave84.disableNeon`.
    2. `src/extension.js` - Inside `synthwave84.enableNeon`, the code determines the path to `workbench.html` based on VS Code's installation directory and version:
       ```javascript
       const appDir = path.dirname(vscode.env.appRoot);
       const base = path.join(appDir,'app','out','vs','code');
       const electronBase = isVSCodeBelowVersion("1.70.0") ? "electron-browser" : "electron-sandbox";
       const workBenchFilename = vscode.version == "1.94.0" ? "workbench.esm.html" : "workbench.html";
       const htmlFile = path.join(base, electronBase, "workbench", workBenchFilename);
       ```
       This code constructs the path to `workbench.html`.
    3. `src/extension.js` - It reads the content of `workbench.html` using `fs.readFileSync`:
       ```javascript
       const html = fs.readFileSync(htmlFile, "utf-8");
       ```
    4. `src/extension.js` - It checks for existing Synthwave script tag and then injects a new one using string replacement and `fs.writeFileSync`:
       ```javascript
       const isEnabled = html.includes("neondreams.js");
       if (!isEnabled) {
           let output = html.replace(/^.*(<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"><\/script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->).*\n?/mg, '');
           output = html.replace(/\<\/html\>/g, `	<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"></script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->\n`);
           output += '</html>';
           fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8");
           // ... restart prompt ...
       }
       ```
       The `fs.writeFileSync(htmlFile, output, "utf-8");` line writes the modified content back to the `workbench.html` file. This operation is not atomic, increasing the risk of file corruption if interrupted.
    5. `src/extension.js` - Similar logic is used in `synthwave84.disableNeon` to remove the injected script tag, also using `fs.writeFileSync`.
    6. **Vulnerability:** The direct modification of `workbench.html` without explicit user consent and the use of non-atomic `fs.writeFileSync` operation are the core issues. Lack of error handling for `fs.writeFileSync` further exacerbates the risk of file corruption.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install VS Code.
        - Install the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
        - Locate the `workbench.html` file in the VS Code installation directory (path is OS and VS Code version dependent). Create a backup of the original `workbench.html`.
    2. **Test for Modification without Explicit Consent:**
        - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Shift+Cmd+P).
        - Execute the command "Enable Neon Dreams".
        - Observe that VS Code prompts to restart, but no explicit confirmation dialog about modifying core files appeared *before* enabling. Restart VS Code.
        - After restart, open `workbench.html` in a text editor and verify that the script tag `<!-- SYNTHWAVE 84 --><script src="neondreams.js"></script><!-- NEON DREAMS -->` has been injected.
    3. **Test for Potential File Corruption (Simulated):**
        - Open the command palette in VS Code and execute "Enable Neon Dreams".
        - **Simulate a write interruption during `fs.writeFileSync`**. For example, try to abruptly terminate the VS Code process (e.g., sending SIGKILL signal) immediately after executing "Enable Neon Dreams" command, attempting to interrupt the file write operation.
        - Restart VS Code.
        - Observe VS Code's behavior upon restarting. Check for error messages, crashes, or UI malfunctions indicating potential `workbench.html` corruption.
        - If VS Code is corrupted, restore `workbench.html` from the backup.
    4. **Test for Reversal and Removal:**
        - Open the command palette and execute "Disable Neon Dreams".
        - Restart VS Code when prompted.
        - Re-open `workbench.html` and verify that the injected script tag has been removed.
    5. **Observe "Corrupted" Warnings and Update Behavior:**
        - Observe if VS Code shows any "corrupted" warnings after enabling and disabling "Neon Dreams".
        - Try updating VS Code after enabling "Neon Dreams". Observe if the theme modifications persist or if VS Code behaves unexpectedly after the update, indicating potential update disruption.

This combined test case demonstrates both the unauthorized modification of core files and the potential for file corruption due to the non-atomic write operation, alongside testing the reversal mechanism.
