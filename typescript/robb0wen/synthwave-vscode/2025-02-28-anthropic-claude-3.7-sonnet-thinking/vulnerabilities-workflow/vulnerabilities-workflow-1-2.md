# Vulnerability List

## Arbitrary Code Injection via Manipulated Theme Template Files

- **Description**:  
  The SynthWave '84 extension reads its JavaScript theme template and CSS files from fixed paths (e.g., `/code/src/js/theme_template.js` and `/code/css/editor_chrome.css`) without any integrity verification or sanitization. A threat actor who supplies a manipulated (malicious) repository can modify these files to include arbitrary JavaScript payloads. When a victim installs the extension from this manipulated repository and executes the "Enable Neon Dreams" command (registered as `synthwave84.enableNeon`), the extension performs token replacements on the unsanitized files and writes the result to a file (`neondreams.js`) inside the VS Code installation directory (in the host's workbench folder). VS Code then loads and executes this file during startup, resulting in remote code (JavaScript) execution under the context of VS Code.

- **Impact**:  
  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code inside the victim's editor process, potentially leading to full compromise of the VS Code environment, leakage of sensitive information, or further system compromise. Given that VS Code may run with elevated privileges (especially on Windows), the impact could extend beyond the editor itself.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:  
  - **None.**  
    The extension currently does not perform any validation, integrity checking, or digital signature verification on the files it loads from disk.

- **Missing Mitigations**:  
  - Verification of file integrity through checksums or digital signatures before processing the file content.  
  - Validation and sanitization of the contents of the template and CSS files prior to performing token replacement.  
  - Secure packaging and distribution processes that prevent supply chain manipulation (e.g., packaging from a trusted build server).

- **Preconditions**:  
  - The victim downloads or installs a manipulated version of the repository—i.e. one whose contents have been altered by a threat actor.  
  - The victim executes the "synthwave84.enableNeon" command, thereby triggering the file read–modify–write cycle.  
  - The VS Code installation directory is writable (e.g., the victim runs VS Code with administrative privileges or the installation is in a user-writable location).

- **Source Code Analysis**:  
  - In `/code/src/extension.js`, the `activate` function registers the command `synthwave84.enableNeon`. When executed, it does the following:
    - **File Reads**:  
      - Reads theme styling from `__dirname + '/css/editor_chrome.css'` using `fs.readFileSync(..., 'utf-8')`.  
      - Reads theme JavaScript template from `__dirname + '/js/theme_template.js'` using `fs.readFileSync(..., 'utf-8')`.
    - **Token Replacement**:  
      - It replaces placeholder tokens (`[DISABLE_GLOW]`, `[CHROME_STYLES]`, `[NEON_BRIGHTNESS]`) in the template using simple string replacement methods without validating the original content.
    - **File Write and Injection**:  
      - Writes the resulting `finalTheme` string to a file (named `neondreams.js`) within the VS Code internal directory.  
      - Modifies `workbench.html` to include a `<script>` tag referencing `neondreams.js`.  
      - Upon restart, VS Code executes this script, which now contains any malicious payload if the theme template was manipulated.
  - In `/code/src/js/theme_template.js`, the unsanitized token placeholders are expected to be replaced with controlled values. However, if an attacker has tampered with this file, they can embed arbitrary JavaScript prior to, during, or after these tokens.

- **Security Test Case**:  
  1. **Preparation**:  
     - Create a modified version of the repository in which the file `/code/src/js/theme_template.js` contains injected JavaScript code (for example, code that sends an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server or opens a reverse shell).  
     - Optionally, modify `/code/css/editor_chrome.css` to include extraneous payload code if desired.
  2. **Installation**:  
     - Package and install the manipulated extension into VS Code (simulate a supply chain attack by hosting the manipulated repository).
  3. **Triggering the Vulnerability**:  
     - Open VS Code and use the command palette to invoke the command `synthwave84.enableNeon`.  
     - This will force the extension to read the manipulated files, perform token replacement, and write out the malicious `neondreams.js` file into VS Code's workbench directory.
  4. **Verification**:  
     - Check the modified `workbench.html` file to ensure it now includes a `<script>` tag for `neondreams.js`.
     - Open the `neondreams.js` file in the VS Code installation directory and verify that the attacker's payload is present.
  5. **Execution and Impact Assessment**:  
     - Restart VS Code to trigger the execution of `neondreams.js`.  
     - Monitor for execution of the injected payload (e.g., network calls, reverse shell initiation, or creation of files indicating compromise).
  6. **Documentation**:  
     - Log all observations and, if the malicious payload executes as intended, confirm that arbitrary code execution is achieved.
