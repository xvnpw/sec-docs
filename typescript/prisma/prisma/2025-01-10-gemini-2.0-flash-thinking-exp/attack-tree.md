## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prisma Client Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prisma_client_weaknesses.md)

*   **Exploit GraphQL API Vulnerabilities (if using Prisma with GraphQL):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Applications using Prisma with GraphQL expose an API endpoint. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the GraphQL implementation, including the Prisma-generated or custom resolvers.
    *   **High-Risk Path:**  Leads to potential data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **Exposing sensitive data through overly permissive queries:** Attackers craft GraphQL queries that retrieve more data than intended, potentially exposing sensitive information due to lack of proper authorization or overly broad query definitions.
        *   **Bypassing authorization checks in mutations:** Attackers exploit flaws in the authorization logic of GraphQL mutations to perform actions they should not be permitted to, leading to data manipulation or privilege escalation.
        *   **Crafting malicious input to modify data unexpectedly:** Attackers provide carefully crafted input to GraphQL mutations that, when processed, results in unintended data modifications or corruption due to insufficient input validation.

*   **Exploit Raw Database Query Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** When developers use `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe()` to execute raw SQL queries, they bypass Prisma's built-in protection against SQL injection. If user-provided input is directly concatenated into these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** This is a direct path to critical impact, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database, and in some cases, even execute operating system commands on the database server.
    *   **Critical Node:**
        *   **Injecting malicious SQL into raw query strings:** Attackers craft malicious SQL code within user inputs that are then directly inserted into the raw SQL query executed by Prisma, allowing them to manipulate the database.

*   **Exploit Inefficient Query Construction:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers may write Prisma queries that are not optimized, leading to excessive database resource consumption when executed. Attackers can exploit this by intentionally triggering these inefficient queries repeatedly or with large datasets.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** This path leads to denial of service by overloading the database, making the application unavailable or severely slow.
    *   **Critical Node:**
        *   **Trigger resource exhaustion through poorly optimized queries:** Attackers identify and exploit poorly written Prisma queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources on the database server when executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prisma Migrate Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prisma_migrate_process.md)

*   **Migration Script Manipulation (if migrations are not properly secured):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If access to database migration files is not properly controlled, attackers who gain access to the codebase or deployment infrastructure can modify these files to inject malicious SQL or code.
    *   **High-Risk Path:**  This can lead to critical impact by allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands during database updates, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even system compromise.
    *   **Critical Node:**
        *   **Injecting malicious SQL or code into migration files:** Attackers modify migration scripts to include malicious SQL commands or code that will be executed when the migrations are applied to the database.

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Migration Files:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might mistakenly include sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets, directly within the database migration files.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** This can lead to critical impact, as attackers gaining access to these files can obtain sensitive credentials, leading to full system compromise or access to other connected services.
    *   **Critical Node:**
        *   **Storing secrets or sensitive configurations within migration scripts:**  Sensitive data is directly embedded within the migration files, making it accessible to anyone who can read these files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prisma Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prisma_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Known Prisma Engine Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Like any software, the Prisma engine itself might contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the Prisma engine.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** The impact of exploiting engine vulnerabilities can be critical, potentially allowing for remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **Known Prisma Engine Vulnerabilities:** The existence of exploitable vulnerabilities within the Prisma engine.
        *   **Exploiting publicly disclosed CVEs in the Prisma engine:** Attackers use known exploits targeting specific vulnerabilities in the Prisma engine to compromise the application or its data.
