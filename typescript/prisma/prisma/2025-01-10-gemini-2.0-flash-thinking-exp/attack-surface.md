# Attack Surface Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Attack Surface: [Raw SQL Queries and Potential for SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/raw_sql_queries_and_potential_for_sql_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Raw SQL Queries and Potential for SQL Injection
    *   **Description:**  Using Prisma's raw query functionality (`prisma.$queryRawUnsafe()`) without proper input sanitization can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma provides the `.$queryRawUnsafe()` method, giving developers the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, bypassing Prisma's built-in query builder safeguards.
    *   **Example:**  A user-provided `orderBy` clause is directly injected into a raw SQL query:
        ```javascript
        const orderBy = req.query.orderBy;
        const users = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(`SELECT * FROM User ORDER BY ${orderBy}`);
        ```
        A malicious user could set `orderBy` to `name; DROP TABLE User; --` to execute arbitrary SQL.
    *   **Impact:**  Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `.$queryRawUnsafe()` whenever possible.** Prefer using Prisma's query builder for type safety and built-in sanitization.
        *   **If `.$queryRawUnsafe()` is necessary, always sanitize and validate user inputs rigorously.**
        *   **Utilize parameterized queries (`prisma.$queryRaw()`) with placeholders for dynamic values.**
        *   **Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user used by Prisma.**

## Attack Surface: [Migration File Tampering](./attack_surfaces/migration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Migration File Tampering
    *   **Description:**  If Prisma migration files are not properly secured, malicious actors could modify them to alter the database schema in unintended ways.
    *   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma Migrate relies on these files to manage database schema changes. Compromising these files can directly impact the database structure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a migration file to add a new user with administrative privileges or to drop critical tables.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, data loss, introduction of backdoors, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Store migration files in version control systems (e.g., Git) with appropriate access controls.**
        *   **Implement code review processes for migration changes.**
        *   **Secure the environment where migrations are applied (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).**
        *   **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in migration files.**

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Prisma Studio](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_prisma_studio.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthorized Access to Prisma Studio
    *   **Description:**  If Prisma Studio is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, unauthorized users can view and potentially modify database data.
    *   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma Studio provides a direct GUI interface to interact with the database. Lack of proper security on this interface is a direct risk.
    *   **Example:**  Prisma Studio is deployed to a public-facing server without any authentication, allowing anyone to browse and modify the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict access to Prisma Studio to development and staging environments only.**
        *   **If access is needed in production (highly discouraged), implement strong authentication (passwords, multi-factor authentication) and authorization mechanisms.**
        *   **Use network firewalls to restrict access to Prisma Studio based on IP addresses or network segments.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Database Credentials
    *   **Description:**  Storing database connection strings or credentials insecurely can lead to unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma requires database connection details to function. If these are exposed, the security of the entire database is at risk.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded in the application code or stored in easily accessible configuration files within the codebase.
    *   **Impact:**  Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions to store database credentials.**
        *   **Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or configuration files.**
        *   **Ensure that configuration files containing connection details are not publicly accessible in version control or deployment environments.**

## Attack Surface: [Over-Privileged Database User](./attack_surfaces/over-privileged_database_user.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Over-Privileged Database User
    *   **Description:**  Granting the database user used by Prisma excessive privileges beyond what is necessary increases the potential impact of a compromise.
    *   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma operates using a database user account. The permissions granted to this user directly affect the potential damage from a security breach.
    *   **Example:** The Prisma database user has `SUPERUSER` or `DBA` privileges, allowing it to perform any action on the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Increased potential for data destruction, privilege escalation within the database, and broader system compromise if the database server is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring the database user for Prisma.**
        *   **Grant only the necessary permissions for Prisma to perform its required operations (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`).**
        *   **Avoid granting administrative or superuser privileges to the Prisma database user.**
