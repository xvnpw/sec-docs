# Threat Model Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Threat: [ORM Injection](./threats/orm_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by Prisma's query builder or raw query methods, results in unintended database queries. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to access. For example, manipulating filter conditions or adding additional SQL clauses.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Client - specifically the query builder methods (`findMany`, `findUnique`, `update`, `delete`, etc.) and raw query functions (`$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Prisma's built-in query builders and avoid raw SQL queries whenever possible.
* Sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in Prisma queries.
* Use parameterized queries when raw SQL is absolutely necessary.
* Implement proper authorization and access control mechanisms at the application level.

## Threat: [Bypass of Row-Level Security (RLS) or Application-Level Access Controls](./threats/bypass_of_row-level_security__rls__or_application-level_access_controls.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates Prisma queries in a way that circumvents intended row-level security policies enforced by the database or access control logic implemented in the application. This could involve crafting queries that bypass filter conditions or target data outside of the user's permitted scope.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Client - the translation layer between application logic and database queries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review Prisma queries to ensure they correctly implement intended access controls.
* Implement defense-in-depth by combining application-level checks with database-level security measures like RLS.
* Use Prisma's features for filtering and data selection carefully.
* Conduct security audits of Prisma query logic.

## Threat: [Malicious Prisma Migrate Operations](./threats/malicious_prisma_migrate_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the development or deployment pipeline and introduces malicious Prisma migrations. These migrations could alter the database schema in harmful ways, such as dropping tables, adding backdoors, or modifying data structures to create vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, introduction of security vulnerabilities, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Migrate - the command-line tool and migration engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the development and deployment pipelines with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement code reviews for all Prisma migration files.
* Use version control for migration files and track changes.
* Implement a process for reviewing and approving migrations before applying them to production.
* Restrict access to the database credentials used by Prisma Migrate.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Prisma Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_prisma_configuration.md)

**Description:** Database connection details required by Prisma (e.g., connection strings) might be stored insecurely, such as hardcoded in configuration files or committed to version control. An attacker gaining access to these credentials could directly access the database.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the database, including access to all data.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Schema - where connection details are often configured, and environment variables if used.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store database credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
* Avoid committing sensitive information to version control.
* Restrict access to configuration files containing Prisma settings.

## Threat: [Insecure Usage of Prisma Studio in Production](./threats/insecure_usage_of_prisma_studio_in_production.md)

**Description:** If Prisma Studio is enabled and accessible in a production environment without proper authentication or network restrictions, attackers could potentially use it to directly query and manipulate the database.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to and modification of production data.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Studio - the graphical user interface for database interaction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable Prisma Studio in production environments.
* If necessary for debugging, restrict access to Prisma Studio to authorized personnel and secure networks using strong authentication.

## Threat: [Bugs or Vulnerabilities in Prisma Client or Engines](./threats/bugs_or_vulnerabilities_in_prisma_client_or_engines.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Prisma's core components (Client, Query Engine, Migration Engine) might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** Unpredictable behavior, potential for data corruption, security breaches, or denial of service. The impact depends heavily on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Prisma Client, Prisma Query Engine, Prisma Migration Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be High or Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest stable versions of Prisma.
* Monitor Prisma's security advisories and release notes for reported vulnerabilities and patches.
* Consider participating in Prisma's security bounty program (if available) or reporting potential issues.
* Implement general security best practices to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
