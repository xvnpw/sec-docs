# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Prisma Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__prisma_context_.md)

1.  **Focus on Prisma Query Inputs:** Identify all places where user input is used *within Prisma queries*. This includes arguments to Prisma Client methods (like `findUnique`, `create`, `where` clauses), raw queries using `$queryRaw`, and dynamic query construction.
2.  **Prioritize Prisma Parameterization:**  Utilize Prisma's built-in query builders and methods as much as possible. These methods automatically parameterize queries, which is the primary defense against SQL injection when using Prisma.
3.  **Parameterize Raw Queries:** If raw SQL queries (`$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`) are necessary, *always* use parameterized queries with Prisma's syntax to prevent SQL injection.  Never concatenate user input directly into raw SQL strings.
4.  **Validate Before Prisma:** Perform input validation on the application layer *before* passing data to Prisma Client methods. This ensures data conforms to expected types and formats before it's used in database interactions.
5.  **Sanitize for Raw Queries (If Absolutely Necessary):** In rare cases where sanitization is needed for raw queries (beyond parameterization, which should be the default), carefully sanitize inputs to escape special characters that could be misinterpreted by the database.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Specifically, SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user input within Prisma queries, especially raw queries or dynamic query construction.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction in risk.  Focuses on the most critical Prisma-related vulnerability by emphasizing parameterization and validation within the Prisma query context.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input validation is implemented on user registration and login forms, but validation specifically tailored to Prisma query inputs is less consistent. Parameterization is generally used with Prisma's query builder methods.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review and enforcement of input validation *specifically* for all user inputs used in Prisma queries, especially in API endpoints handling data manipulation and filtering. Consistent parameterization for all raw queries needs to be ensured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Prisma Schema Design (Security Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_prisma_schema_design__security_focus_.md)

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege in Prisma Schema:** Design the Prisma schema to expose only the data and relationships *necessary for the application's intended functionality through Prisma Client*. Avoid including sensitive fields or relationships in the schema if they are not directly accessed or manipulated via Prisma.
2.  **Data Type Enforcement in Schema:** Leverage Prisma schema's data type definitions and constraints (e.g., `required`, `unique`, `length`) to enforce data integrity at the Prisma layer, ensuring data handled by Prisma conforms to expectations.
3.  **Schema Review for Prisma Client Exposure:** Regularly review the Prisma schema specifically from a security perspective, considering what data is accessible and modifiable through Prisma Client and if this exposure aligns with security best practices.
4.  **Abstraction for GraphQL (Prisma and GraphQL):** If using Prisma with GraphQL, use Prisma's features to abstract the database schema from the GraphQL schema. Control data exposure through GraphQL resolvers and data transformations, preventing direct mapping of database structures to the API.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Inadvertent exposure of sensitive data through an overly permissive Prisma schema, making it accessible via Prisma Client queries.
    *   **Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Lack of proper data type and constraint definitions in the Prisma schema can lead to unexpected data manipulation or bypass of application logic when interacting with data through Prisma.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction in risk.  Focuses on controlling data exposure specifically through the Prisma schema and Prisma Client.
    *   Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction in risk.  Leverages Prisma schema features to enhance data integrity within the Prisma layer.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic schema design principles are followed. Data types and basic constraints are defined in the Prisma schema.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A dedicated security review of the Prisma schema to minimize data exposure through Prisma Client.  Full abstraction of the database schema in GraphQL (if used) using Prisma's capabilities is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Access Control for Prisma User](./mitigation_strategies/database_access_control_for_prisma_user.md)

1.  **Dedicated Prisma Database User (Specific to Prisma):** Ensure a dedicated database user is created *specifically for Prisma to connect to the database*. This user should be distinct from any administrative or other application users.
2.  **Least Privilege for Prisma User (Database Permissions):** Grant the Prisma database user *only the minimum necessary database privileges* required for the application's data access patterns through Prisma.  Restrict permissions to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on the specific tables accessed by Prisma. Avoid granting broader permissions.
3.  **Prisma Connection String Security:** Securely manage the database connection string used by Prisma. Avoid hardcoding credentials in code. Use environment variables or secrets management solutions to store and access database credentials used by Prisma.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access (High Severity):**  Mitigates the risk of unauthorized database access by limiting the privileges of the dedicated Prisma database user.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the potential for privilege escalation by ensuring the Prisma user has minimal database permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Database Access: High reduction in risk. Directly addresses database access control for the Prisma component.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium reduction in risk. Limits the potential damage even if the application using Prisma is compromised.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  A dedicated database user is used for Prisma. Basic database permissions are set. Prisma connection string is managed via environment variables.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A detailed review and tightening of database permissions for the Prisma user based on the principle of least privilege, specifically considering Prisma's data access needs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Prisma Migrate Workflow (Security Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_prisma_migrate_workflow__security_focus_.md)

1.  **Version Control for Prisma Schema and Migrations (Prisma Specific Files):**  Mandate version control for the `schema.prisma` file and all generated Prisma migration files. This ensures traceability and allows for rollbacks of schema changes managed by Prisma Migrate.
2.  **Code Review of Prisma Migrations:** Implement a code review process *specifically for Prisma migration files* before applying them to any environment. Reviewers should assess the schema changes generated by Prisma Migrate for unintended consequences or security implications.
3.  **Restrict Access to Prisma Migrate CLI and Configuration:** Limit access to the Prisma Migrate CLI and configuration files (including `.env` files containing database connection strings used by Prisma Migrate) to authorized personnel only. Secure the environment where Prisma Migrate commands are executed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Schema Changes (Medium Severity):**  Prevents unauthorized modifications to the database schema through Prisma Migrate by enforcing version control and code review.
    *   **Accidental Data Loss or Corruption (Medium Severity):**  Code review and testing of Prisma migrations help reduce the risk of accidental data loss or corruption caused by schema changes managed by Prisma Migrate.
    *   **Exposure of Database Credentials (Medium Severity):**  Restricting access to Prisma Migrate configuration helps protect database credentials used by Prisma Migrate.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Schema Changes: Medium reduction in risk. Focuses on securing the schema migration process managed by Prisma.
    *   Accidental Data Loss or Corruption: Medium reduction in risk. Improves the reliability of schema migrations managed by Prisma.
    *   Exposure of Database Credentials: Medium reduction in risk. Protects credentials used in the Prisma Migrate context.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Prisma schema and migrations are under version control. Migrations are applied manually.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal code review process specifically for Prisma migration files is needed. Access control to Prisma Migrate CLI and configuration files should be strengthened.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protection of Prisma Studio (Security Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/protection_of_prisma_studio__security_focus_.md)

1.  **Disable Prisma Studio in Production (Prisma Specific Tool):**  Completely disable Prisma Studio in production deployments. Prisma Studio is a development and debugging tool and should not be accessible in production environments.
2.  **Restrict Access to Prisma Studio in Non-Production:**  In development and staging environments where Prisma Studio might be used, restrict access to authorized developers only. Use network restrictions (firewall rules, IP whitelisting, VPN) to limit access to trusted networks.
3.  **Avoid Public Exposure of Prisma Studio:** Never expose Prisma Studio directly to the public internet. It provides direct database access and should be protected as a highly sensitive internal tool.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access and Modification (High Severity):**  Prevents unauthorized access to Prisma Studio, which could lead to direct database manipulation bypassing application security.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Protects against information disclosure through Prisma Studio, which can reveal database structure and data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access and Modification: High reduction in risk. Directly addresses the risk associated with Prisma Studio exposure.
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction in risk. Prevents information leaks through Prisma Studio.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Prisma Studio is used in development environments but is not intentionally exposed to the public internet.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicitly disable Prisma Studio in production deployments. Implement network restrictions to control access to Prisma Studio in development and staging environments.
