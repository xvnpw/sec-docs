## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Prisma - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality of the application by leveraging Prisma vulnerabilities.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Prisma
    * OR
        * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Manipulate Data Access via Prisma
            * OR
                * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Exploit Prisma Query Language (PQL) Injection
                * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Exploit GraphQL Injection (if using Prisma with GraphQL)
        * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Abuse Prisma's Configuration or Dependencies
            * OR
                * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Compromise Prisma's Configuration
                * **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Prisma's Dependencies

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Manipulate Data Access via Prisma:** This category focuses on attacks that directly interact with the database through Prisma, aiming to bypass intended access controls and manipulate data.

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Exploit Prisma Query Language (PQL) Injection:**
    * Craft malicious PQL queries that bypass Prisma's sanitization or validation, leading to unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Exploit GraphQL Injection (if using Prisma with GraphQL):**
    * Craft malicious GraphQL queries that leverage Prisma's data fetching capabilities to access or manipulate data beyond intended permissions.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Abuse Prisma's Configuration or Dependencies:** This category focuses on attacks that target Prisma's configuration settings or the security of its underlying dependencies to gain unauthorized access or control.

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Compromise Prisma's Configuration:**
    * Gain access to Prisma's configuration files (e.g., connection strings) to directly access the database or modify Prisma's behavior.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Easy

* **[CRITICAL_NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Prisma's Dependencies:**
    * Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries or packages that Prisma depends on.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
