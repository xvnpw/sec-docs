# Threat Model Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Raw Queries](./threats/sql_injection_through_raw_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used with Prisma's raw query functions (`$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`, or the `sql` template tag *incorrectly*), bypasses Prisma's usual protections and executes arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This occurs when developers directly concatenate user input into the SQL string instead of using parameterized queries.  This is a *direct* threat because it exploits how Prisma interacts with the database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (reading sensitive data).
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Database server compromise.
    *   Potential for complete application takeover.
*   **Prisma Component Affected:**
    *   `$queryRaw` function
    *   `$executeRaw` function
    *   `sql` template tag (when used *incorrectly* without parameterization)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly Prefer:** Use Prisma's type-safe query builder (e.g., `findMany`, `create`, `update`) whenever possible. Avoid raw queries unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **If Raw Queries are Essential:** *Always* use parameterized queries via Prisma's `sql` template tag *correctly*. Never concatenate user-provided data directly into the SQL string. Example (correct): `prisma.$queryRaw(sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`)`. Example (incorrect and vulnerable): `prisma.$queryRaw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId)`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* data reaches Prisma, even when using parameterized queries. This adds a layer of defense, but is *not* a primary mitigation for this *direct* threat.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on any use of raw queries.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Prisma Client updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Migration History Manipulation](./threats/migration_history_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to either the database server or the file system containing the migration files. They modify the `_prisma_migrations` table (in the database) or the migration files themselves to:
    *   Roll back the database to an older, known vulnerable state.
    *   Inject malicious SQL code into a migration that will be executed later.
    *   Alter the order of migrations to cause unexpected behavior.
    This is a *direct* threat because it targets Prisma Migrate's core functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Reintroduction of previously patched vulnerabilities.
    *   Execution of arbitrary SQL code (similar to SQL injection).
    *   Data corruption or loss.
    *   Application instability.
*   **Prisma Component Affected:**
    *   Prisma Migrate
    *   `_prisma_migrations` table (in the database)
    *   Migration files (e.g., `*.sql` files in the `prisma/migrations` directory)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Access Control:** Strictly limit access to the database server and the file system where migration files are stored. Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing to track changes to the `_prisma_migrations` table.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to migration files.
    *   **Version Control:** Store migration files in a version control system (e.g., Git) and enforce a strong review process for any changes.
    *   **Backups:** Regularly back up the database, including the `_prisma_migrations` table.
    *   **CI/CD:** Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the application of migrations and prevent manual modifications in production.
    *   **Consider Checksums/Signatures:** Explore using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of migration files before applying them.

## Threat: [Schema Modification](./threats/schema_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `schema.prisma` file and modifies it. This could involve:
    *   Changing data types to weaker ones.
    *   Removing constraints (e.g., `unique`, `@default`, validation rules).
    *   Adding new fields or relations that can be exploited later.
    *   Changing relation types or cardinalities.
    This directly impacts Prisma's data modeling and how it interacts with the database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data integrity violations.
    *   Introduction of new attack vectors.
    *   Application instability or unexpected behavior.
    *   Potential for data loss or corruption.
*   **Prisma Component Affected:**
    *   `schema.prisma` file
    *   Prisma Client (indirectly, as it's generated based on the schema)
    *   Prisma Migrate (indirectly, as it uses the schema to generate migrations)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Access Control:** Treat `schema.prisma` as a critical configuration file. Restrict access using file system permissions and version control.
    *   **Version Control:** Store `schema.prisma` in a version control system (e.g., Git) and enforce a strict review process for all changes.
    *   **Change Management:** Implement a formal change management process for any modifications to the schema.
    *   **CI/CD:** Use a CI/CD pipeline to validate the schema and prevent unauthorized changes from being deployed. This pipeline should include checks for schema integrity and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the `schema.prisma` file for any unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Prisma Client with Excessive Database Permissions](./threats/prisma_client_with_excessive_database_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The database user account used by Prisma Client is granted more permissions than necessary. If an attacker compromises the application through *any* vulnerability (even one not directly related to Prisma), they could leverage these excessive permissions to perform unauthorized actions on the database, amplifying the impact. This is *direct* because it concerns the Prisma Client's connection configuration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased impact of other vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, application-level flaws).
    *   Potential for data breaches, modification, or deletion beyond the intended scope of the application.
*   **Prisma Component Affected:**
    *   Prisma Client (configuration of the database connection, specifically the user credentials and their associated permissions)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the database user *only* the minimum necessary permissions required for Prisma Client to function correctly. Avoid using superuser accounts. Define precisely which tables and operations the Prisma Client needs access to.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use database roles to define specific sets of permissions and assign these roles to the Prisma Client user. This makes permission management more organized and less error-prone.
    *   **Separate Users:** Consider using separate database users for different parts of the application or for different operations (e.g., a read-only user for certain queries, a read-write user for others). This limits the blast radius of a compromise.
    *   **Regular Permission Reviews:** Periodically review and audit the permissions granted to the Prisma Client database user. Ensure that permissions are still appropriate and haven't become overly permissive over time.
