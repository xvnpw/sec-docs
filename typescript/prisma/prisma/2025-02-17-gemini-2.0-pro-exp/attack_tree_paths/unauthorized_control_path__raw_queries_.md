# Deep Analysis: Prisma Raw Query SQL Injection Vulnerability

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Raw Queries Vulnerabilities -> SQLi in Raw Query [CRITICAL] -> Bypassing Prisma's Type-Safety" attack path within a Prisma-based application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify common coding patterns that introduce this risk.
*   Assess the real-world impact and likelihood of successful exploitation.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention, going beyond the high-level mitigations listed in the attack tree.
*   Define detection strategies for identifying vulnerable code.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the use of `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` within a Node.js application using the Prisma ORM.  It does *not* cover:

*   SQL injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application (e.g., direct database connections bypassing Prisma).
*   Other types of vulnerabilities within Prisma (e.g., data leakage through incorrect relation configurations).
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying database system itself (e.g., misconfigured database permissions).
*   Attacks that do not involve SQL injection (e.g., NoSQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  We will analyze hypothetical and real-world (if available, anonymized) code snippets demonstrating vulnerable and secure uses of `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw`.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to SQL injection in general and, if available, specifically targeting Prisma or similar ORMs.
*   **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles and their potential motivations for exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:** We will compare vulnerable code against established secure coding best practices for database interactions and input validation.
*   **Static Analysis Tooling Review:** We will explore the capabilities of static analysis tools to detect this type of vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. Vulnerability Mechanism

The core vulnerability lies in the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into a raw SQL query string.  Prisma's type-safety and query builder provide protection against SQL injection *when used correctly*.  However, `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` bypass these safeguards, placing the responsibility for security entirely on the developer.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```javascript
async function getUserByName(name) {
  try {
    const user = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = ${name}`;
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Attacker input:  name = "'; DROP TABLE User; --"
```

In this example, the attacker-provided `name` is directly inserted into the SQL query.  The resulting query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE User; --';
```

This executes two statements: the intended `SELECT` (which likely returns nothing) and the malicious `DROP TABLE User`, deleting the entire User table.

**Example (Slightly Less Vulnerable, Still Problematic):**

```javascript
async function getUserById(id) {
    const user = await prisma.$queryRaw(`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${id}`);
    return user;
}
//Attacker input id = 1 OR 1=1
```
This will result query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1;
```
This will expose all users.

**Example (Mitigated - Parameterized Query):**

```javascript
async function getUserByName(name) {
  try {
    const user = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = ${Prisma.sql`${name}`}`;
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```
Or, even better:
```javascript
async function getUserByName(name) {
  try {
    const user = await prisma.$queryRaw(Prisma.sql`SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = ${name}`);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

This uses Prisma's `Prisma.sql` template literal tag to properly escape the `name` parameter, preventing SQL injection.  The database receives the parameter as a separate value, not as part of the SQL code itself.

**Example (Best Practice - Avoid Raw Queries):**

```javascript
async function getUserByName(name) {
  try {
    const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
      where: {
        name: name,
      },
    });
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

This uses Prisma's standard query builder, which automatically handles parameterization and escaping, providing the best protection.

### 4.2. Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack via raw queries can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from any table in the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, etc.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can alter or delete data, potentially causing data corruption, financial loss, or reputational damage.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to gain administrative privileges within the database, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands or compromise the entire database server.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can use SQL injection to cause the database server to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting application availability.
*   **Code Execution (in some cases):** Depending on the database system and its configuration, attackers might be able to leverage SQL injection to execute operating system commands on the database server.

### 4.3. Likelihood and Effort

*   **Likelihood (Medium):**  While Prisma encourages safe usage, the existence of `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` creates an inherent risk.  Developers might use these functions due to perceived performance benefits, lack of awareness of the risks, or complex query requirements that are difficult to express with the standard query builder.
*   **Effort (Medium):**  Exploiting a basic SQL injection vulnerability is relatively straightforward, especially if user input is directly concatenated into the query string.  More sophisticated attacks (e.g., blind SQL injection) require more effort and skill.
*   **Skill Level (Intermediate):**  A basic understanding of SQL and web application security is sufficient to exploit simple vulnerabilities.  More advanced techniques require deeper knowledge of database systems and exploitation methods.

### 4.4. Detection Strategies

*   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect all instances of `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` for proper parameterization and input validation.  This is the most reliable method.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security plugins, SonarQube, Semgrep) to automatically scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tools can identify patterns of string concatenation within raw queries.  However, they may produce false positives or miss complex cases.  A custom rule for Semgrep might look like this (this is a simplified example and may need refinement):

    ```yaml
    rules:
      - id: prisma-raw-query-sql-injection
        patterns:
          - pattern: |
              prisma.$queryRaw`...${$VAR}...`
          - pattern-not: |
              prisma.$queryRaw`...${Prisma.sql`${$VAR}`}...`
        message: "Potential SQL injection vulnerability in raw Prisma query.  Use Prisma.sql for parameterization."
        languages: [javascript, typescript]
        severity: ERROR
    ```
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing, including fuzzing, to attempt to inject malicious SQL code into the application.  This can help identify vulnerabilities that are missed by static analysis.
*   **Database Query Logging:**  Enable detailed query logging on the database server and monitor for suspicious SQL queries.  This can help detect attacks in progress or identify vulnerable code after an incident.
* **Runtime Protection:** Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with SQL injection protection capabilities.  A WAF can filter out malicious requests before they reach the application.

### 4.5. Mitigation and Prevention (Detailed)

1.  **Avoid Raw Queries Whenever Possible:**  Prioritize using Prisma's standard query builder.  It is designed to be secure and provides excellent protection against SQL injection.

2.  **Use `Prisma.sql` for Parameterization:** If raw queries are unavoidable, *always* use `Prisma.sql` to parameterize user input.  This ensures that user-supplied values are treated as data, not as executable code.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** Even with parameterization, it's good practice to validate and sanitize user input.  This provides an additional layer of defense and can help prevent other types of attacks (e.g., XSS).  Validation should check the data type, length, and format of the input.  Sanitization should remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions.  Do not use a highly privileged account (e.g., the database administrator account).

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase, including code reviews and penetration testing.

6.  **Stay Updated:** Keep Prisma Client and all other dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.

7.  **Education and Training:**  Ensure that all developers are aware of the risks of SQL injection and are trained on secure coding practices for Prisma.

8. **Prepared Statements:** Prisma's `Prisma.sql` utilizes prepared statements under the hood.  Understanding how prepared statements work reinforces the importance of using this method.  Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the database from interpreting user input as code.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Raw Queries Vulnerabilities -> SQLi in Raw Query [CRITICAL] -> Bypassing Prisma's Type-Safety" attack path represents a significant security risk in Prisma-based applications.  While Prisma provides excellent built-in protection against SQL injection, the use of `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` bypasses these safeguards.  By understanding the vulnerability mechanism, impact, and mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection and build more secure applications.  The most effective approach is to avoid raw queries whenever possible and to use `Prisma.sql` for parameterization when raw queries are necessary.  A combination of code review, static analysis, and penetration testing is crucial for identifying and addressing this vulnerability.
