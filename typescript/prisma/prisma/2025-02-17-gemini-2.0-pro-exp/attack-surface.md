# Attack Surface Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Attack Surface: [1. Unvalidated Dynamic Field/Where Clause Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__unvalidated_dynamic_fieldwhere_clause_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the structure of Prisma queries by controlling field names, filter conditions, or other query components through unvalidated user input. This is *not* SQL injection, but a Prisma-specific logic injection.
*   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma's query builder, while preventing traditional SQL injection, can be misused if application code dynamically constructs queries using unsanitized user input. The type-safe nature of Prisma *does not* inherently prevent this; it prevents *type* errors, not *logic* errors based on malicious input.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Code:
    const fieldToFilter = req.query.field; // Attacker controls this!
    const valueToFilter = req.query.value;

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      where: {
        [fieldToFilter]: { // DYNAMIC field name!
          equals: valueToFilter,
        },
      },
    });
    ```
    An attacker could set `fieldToFilter` to `password` and `valueToFilter` to a known or guessed password hash, potentially retrieving user records. Or, they could access a sensitive field like `isAdmin`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access (reading, modifying, or deleting data).
    *   Bypassing access controls.
    *   Information disclosure (leaking sensitive data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Use a robust validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) to define a schema for *all* user input.  Validate *before* using the input in *any* part of a Prisma query. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  If dynamic field selection is *absolutely necessary*, use a whitelist to allow *only* specific, pre-approved field names.  *Never* allow arbitrary field names from user input.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic `where` Clauses:**  Whenever possible, use static, predefined `where` clauses.  If dynamic filtering is needed, build the `where` clause using a safe, controlled method, ensuring all input is validated.
    *   **Example of Safer Code (using a whitelist):**
        ```javascript
        const allowedFields = ['username', 'email', 'firstName', 'lastName'];
        const fieldToFilter = req.query.field;
        const valueToFilter = req.query.value;

        if (allowedFields.includes(fieldToFilter)) {
          const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
            where: {
              [fieldToFilter]: {
                equals: valueToFilter,
              },
            },
          });
        } else {
          // Handle invalid input (e.g., return an error)
        }
        ```

## Attack Surface: [2. Overly Verbose Error Messages](./attack_surfaces/2__overly_verbose_error_messages.md)

*   **Description:** Prisma Client, if misconfigured or if errors are not handled properly, can expose detailed error messages that reveal sensitive information about the database schema, query structure, or internal logic.
*   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma Client throws specific error types (e.g., `PrismaClientKnownRequestError`, `PrismaClientValidationError`) that can contain detailed information, *including parts of the query*.  Uncaught exceptions or poorly handled errors can expose this information directly.
*   **Example:** An unhandled `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` in a production environment might reveal the exact SQL query that failed, including table and column names, and potentially even values if they were part of the error context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (database schema, query structure, potentially sensitive data within the query).
    *   Facilitates other attacks (e.g., by providing information needed for query manipulation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Production Error Handling:**  *Never* expose raw Prisma Client error messages to end-users in production.  Implement a global error handler to catch all exceptions and return generic error messages. This is paramount.
    *   **Specific Error Handling:**  Catch specific Prisma Client error types and handle them appropriately, logging the details *securely* (never to the client) and providing user-friendly error messages.
    *   **Disable Detailed Errors:** Ensure that any configuration options that might expose detailed error messages are disabled in production.
    *   **Example (using try-catch):**
        ```javascript
        try {
          const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ /* ... */ });
          // ...
        } catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError) {
            // Log the error SECURELY (e.g., to a file or monitoring system)
            console.error("Database error:", error.message); // Log, don't expose!
            // Return a GENERIC error message to the user
            res.status(500).send("An internal server error occurred.");
          } else {
            // Handle other errors
          }
        }
        ```

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Query-Induced)](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__query-induced_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft *valid* Prisma queries that, while syntactically correct, consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma's query builder allows for complex queries, including nested relations (`include`) and filtering.  If the application doesn't limit these features, attackers can abuse them to create resource-intensive queries *through Prisma*.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send a request with a very large `take` value and deeply nested `include` statements: `prisma.user.findMany({ take: 1000000, include: { posts: { include: { comments: { include: { likes: true } } } } } })`.  Even if the database *has* the data, retrieving and serializing it can be crippling.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive).
    *   Database performance degradation.
    *   Potential financial costs (cloud database usage-based pricing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Pagination:**  Implement pagination for *all* queries that could potentially return large result sets.  Use `skip` and `take` responsibly, and enforce *strict* limits on the maximum `take` value. This is crucial for any data-fetching endpoint.
    *   **Limit `include` Depth:**  Avoid deeply nested `include` statements.  Carefully consider the performance implications.  Implement limits on the nesting depth if necessary, or use a more granular approach to fetching related data.
    *   **Validate Filter Fields:**  If allowing users to filter, ensure filtering is only allowed on *indexed* fields.  Prevent filtering on non-indexed fields or large text fields, which can lead to full table scans.
    *   **Database Monitoring:** Monitor database resource usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks. This is a general best practice, but particularly important when dealing with potentially complex queries.
    * **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for database queries.

## Attack Surface: [4. Cache Poisoning (Prisma Accelerate)](./attack_surfaces/4__cache_poisoning__prisma_accelerate_.md)

*   **Description:** When using Prisma Accelerate, attackers manipulate the cache key generation logic to inject malicious data into the cache or cause cache collisions, leading to incorrect data being served. This is *specific* to using Prisma Accelerate.
*   **How Prisma Contributes:** Prisma Accelerate provides the caching layer. The vulnerability arises from how the *application* uses Accelerate, specifically in how cache keys are generated and how access control is (or isn't) enforced at the cache level.
*   **Example:** If the cache key is solely based on a user ID, and an attacker can guess or manipulate another user's ID, they might access cached data belonging to that user. If the cache key doesn't include *all* relevant query parameters, different queries might incorrectly share the same cache entry.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data leakage (serving incorrect or sensitive data).
    *   Cache poisoning (corrupting the cache).
    *   Potential for denial of service (cache flooding).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Cache Key Generation:** Design cache keys that are unique and unpredictable, incorporating *all* relevant factors affecting the query results (user ID, *all* query parameters, etc.). Use a hashing algorithm.
    *   **Access Control at Cache Layer:** Enforce access controls *at the cache layer* to prevent unauthorized access. This might involve authentication tokens or other mechanisms to verify user identity *before* retrieving from the cache.
    *   **Input Validation (Always):** Validate all user input to prevent manipulation of the cache key or the underlying query.
    *   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement proper cache invalidation to ensure stale data isn't served.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor cache hit/miss/eviction rates.
