# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use select and include Projections Carefully](./mitigation_strategies/use_select_and_include_projections_carefully.md)

1.  **Identify Data Needs:** Before writing any Prisma query, clearly define the specific data required by the client. List the exact fields and related entities needed.
2.  **Use `select` for Fields:**  In your Prisma query, use the `select` option to specify *only* the fields of the primary model that are required.  Example: `prisma.user.findMany({ select: { id: true, username: true } })`
3.  **Use `include` for Relations:** If you need data from related models, use the `include` option.  Within the `include`, *also* use `select` to specify the fields needed from the related model.  Example: `prisma.post.findMany({ include: { author: { select: { id: true, name: true } } } })`
4.  **Avoid Wildcard Fetches:** Never fetch entire objects (`prisma.user.findMany()`) unless you genuinely need *all* fields.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Start with a minimal `select` and `include` and add fields only as needed. Test thoroughly after each change.
6. **Review Existing Queries:** Go through all existing Prisma queries and refactor them for optimal data fetching.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-fetching / Data Exposure (N+1 Problem):**  Severity: High. Reduces unnecessary data fetching, improving performance and preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Indirectly):** Severity: Medium. Lessens the load on the database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-fetching / Data Exposure:**  Risk reduction: High.  Primary mitigation.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  (Example: Partially implemented. Used in `user` and `post` modules, not consistently in `comment`.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Missing in `comment` module, `getCommentsByPostId` function. Missing in several older API endpoints.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Error Handling (Prisma-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_error_handling__prisma-specific_.md)

1.  **Wrap Prisma Calls:** Enclose all Prisma Client calls within `try...catch` blocks.
2.  **Catch Specific Prisma Errors:**  Within the `catch` block, handle Prisma-specific errors (e.g., `PrismaClientKnownRequestError`, `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError`, `PrismaClientValidationError`) appropriately.  Use the error codes and properties provided by these error types to determine the cause of the error.
3.  **Log Detailed Errors Internally (with Redaction):** Log the full Prisma error details (message, stack trace, error code) to your internal logging system.  *Crucially*, redact or mask any sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, user data) that might be present in the error message *before* logging.
4.  **Return Generic User-Friendly Errors:**  To the client, return a generic, non-revealing error message.
5. **Environment Variable Control:** Use an environment variable (e.g., `NODE_ENV`) to control error detail. Suppress detailed errors in `production`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Error Messages:** Severity: High. Prevents sensitive information (potentially exposed by Prisma error messages) from reaching end-users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: High. Primary mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Partially. Basic `try...catch` blocks, but inconsistent logging and sometimes too-detailed user-facing errors.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Consistent error logging with redaction. Standardized, generic error messages. Explicit handling of Prisma-specific error types.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Raw Queries and Use Parameterized Queries (Prisma-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_raw_queries_and_use_parameterized_queries__prisma-specific_.md)

1.  **Prioritize Type-Safe API:** Use Prisma Client's type-safe API (e.g., `findMany`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) for all standard operations.
2.  **Justify Raw Queries:** If a raw query is absolutely necessary, document the reason clearly. Explain why the type-safe API is insufficient.
3.  **Use Parameterized Queries (Template Literals with Prisma):** If a raw query is unavoidable, *always* use parameterized queries.  With Prisma, this means using template literals with placeholders:
    ```typescript
    const userId = 123; // User input (example)
    const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId}`;
    ```
    *Never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.
4. **Avoid `prisma.$executeRawUnsafe` and `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe`:** Avoid using these methods.
5. **Code Reviews:** Enforce code reviews that specifically scrutinize any use of raw queries.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Indirect, via Raw Queries):** Severity: High. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: High. Primary mitigation for SQL injection with raw queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Mostly. Team avoids raw queries, but a few legacy instances need review.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Review/refactor `legacyReportGenerator` function (uses raw query without parameterization). Code review checklist item for raw query usage.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Prisma Migrate for Schema Management](./mitigation_strategies/use_prisma_migrate_for_schema_management.md)

1.  **Initialize Prisma Migrate:** Initialize Prisma Migrate in your project (`npx prisma migrate dev`).
2.  **Schema Changes via Migrate:**  *All* schema changes should be made through Prisma Migrate.  *Never* modify the database schema directly.
3.  **Create Migration Files:**  Use `npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>` for new migrations.
4.  **Apply Migrations:**  Apply migrations to your development database: `npx prisma migrate dev`.
5.  **Deploy Migrations:**  In deployment, apply migrations to production: `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
6.  **Version Control:**  Commit your migration files to version control.
7. **Schema Validation in CI/CD:** Integrate `prisma migrate status` into your CI/CD pipeline.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Schema Drift and Breaking Changes:** Severity: High. Keeps Prisma schema and database schema synchronized.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Schema Drift:** Risk reduction: High. Primary mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Fully implemented. All schema changes via Migrate, applied automatically during deployment.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: None.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Prisma](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_prisma.md)

1.  **Monitor Prisma Releases:** Regularly check for new releases and security updates.
2.  **Update Prisma Packages:** Use your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm) to update Prisma CLI and Client: `npm update @prisma/client prisma`.
3.  **Test After Updates:** Thoroughly test your application after updating Prisma.
4.  **Automate Updates (Optional):** Consider using a dependency management tool.
5. **Review Changelogs:** Review changelogs for breaking changes before updating.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Using Outdated Prisma Version (with Known Vulnerabilities):** Severity: Variable. Protects against known security flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Outdated Version Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: High (for known vulnerabilities).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Periodic updates, but no strict schedule. No automated update checks.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Establish a regular update schedule. Consider automated update checks.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Timeouts with Prisma](./mitigation_strategies/database_timeouts_with_prisma.md)

1.  **Configure Timeouts:** Within your Prisma Client configuration, set appropriate timeouts for database queries. This prevents long-running or stalled queries from consuming resources indefinitely. Use the `timeout` option in your Prisma Client constructor or on individual query operations.
    ```typescript
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({
      timeout: 5000, // Global timeout of 5 seconds
    });

    // Or, per query:
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      timeout: 2000, // 2-second timeout for this specific query
    });
    ```
2.  **Test with Realistic Timeouts:** Test your application with realistic timeout values to ensure that legitimate queries are not prematurely terminated.
3.  **Handle Timeout Errors:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle timeout errors (e.g., `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` with code `P2024`).  Inform the user appropriately and potentially retry the operation with a longer timeout (if appropriate).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Indirectly):** Severity: Medium. Prevents long-running queries from blocking database connections and other resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Medium. Contributes to overall resource management.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: Not implemented. No specific timeouts are configured.)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: Need to configure global and potentially per-query timeouts in Prisma Client. Need to add error handling for timeout errors.)
