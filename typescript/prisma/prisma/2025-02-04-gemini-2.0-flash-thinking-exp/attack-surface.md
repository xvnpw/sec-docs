# Attack Surface Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (via Raw Queries) - Critical](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__via_raw_queries__-_critical.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious SQL code through unsanitized user input when using Prisma's raw query features. This directly exploits Prisma's capability to execute raw SQL.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma's `$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`, and similar methods are the *direct* mechanism enabling this attack surface.  Using these methods with unsanitized user input makes the application vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A blog application uses `$queryRaw` to search posts based on keywords. User input for keywords is directly concatenated into the SQL query: `prisma.$queryRaw\`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE '%${userInput}%'\``. An attacker injects `userInput = "%\' OR 1=1 --"` to bypass the intended query and potentially retrieve all posts or perform further malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential database server compromise, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Raw Queries:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid using Prisma's raw query methods (`$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`, etc.) whenever possible. Utilize Prisma's query builder methods which are designed to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Raw Queries - if unavoidable):** If raw queries are absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* user inputs before including them in the SQL query. This is complex and error-prone, making raw queries inherently risky.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (Raw Queries):**  If raw queries are unavoidable, *always* utilize Prisma's raw query features that support parameterized queries (e.g., using placeholders and passing parameters separately). This separates SQL code from user data, preventing injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):**  Limit database user permissions to the minimum required for the application, reducing the potential damage from a successful SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Prisma Client Configuration (Exposed Connection Strings) - Critical](./attack_surfaces/insecure_prisma_client_configuration__exposed_connection_strings__-_critical.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of sensitive database connection strings, potentially leading to unauthorized database access. This directly relates to how Prisma is configured to connect to the database.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma Client *requires* a database connection string.  The way this string is managed and stored is a direct aspect of Prisma configuration.  Insecure handling (hardcoding, public exposure) directly contributes to the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer hardcodes the database connection string, including username and password, directly into the Prisma schema file or a publicly accessible configuration file within the application repository. This repository is then exposed (e.g., public GitHub repo, compromised server). Attackers find the connection string and gain direct database access *because of the exposed Prisma configuration*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, potential database server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Securely Store Connection Strings:**  Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store database credentials.  This is a standard best practice for managing secrets, and crucial for Prisma configuration.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**  *Never* hardcode database credentials directly in code or configuration files. This is a fundamental security principle.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:**  Ensure that configuration files containing connection strings (even if using environment variables indirectly) are not publicly accessible and are protected with appropriate file system permissions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):**  Use a dedicated database user for Prisma Client with minimal necessary permissions.  Even if credentials are leaked, limiting permissions reduces potential damage.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Access Control to Prisma Studio - High](./attack_surfaces/insecure_access_control_to_prisma_studio_-_high.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Prisma Studio, leading to potential data breaches or data manipulation through the Studio interface. This is directly related to securing access to the Prisma Studio feature.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma Studio is a *feature provided by Prisma*.  The security of accessing and using this feature is a direct responsibility when deploying and utilizing Prisma.  Lack of access control directly exposes this Prisma component.
*   **Example:** Prisma Studio is deployed and accessible without any authentication or authorization. An attacker discovers the URL and gains access to the Studio interface, allowing them to browse, query, and potentially modify data in the database *through the Prisma Studio interface*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, information disclosure, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication (Prisma Studio):**  Enable and enforce strong authentication for Prisma Studio access (e.g., username/password, multi-factor authentication). This is essential for securing access to the Prisma Studio feature.
    *   **Authorization and Role-Based Access Control (Prisma Studio):** Implement authorization mechanisms to control what actions different users can perform within Prisma Studio. Limit user privileges within the Studio interface.
    *   **Network Segmentation (Prisma Studio):** Restrict network access to Prisma Studio to authorized networks or IP addresses. Ideally, make it accessible only from development or internal networks, *not* the public internet. This limits exposure of the Prisma Studio feature.
    *   **Disable Prisma Studio in Production (If Not Needed):** If Prisma Studio is not required in production environments, disable or remove it entirely to eliminate this attack surface.  This is the most secure approach if Studio is not actively used in production.
