# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Prisma, aims to simplify database access for developers by providing a modern database toolkit. It focuses on making database interactions intuitive, safe, and efficient, ultimately increasing developer productivity and application reliability.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Primary Goal: Enhance developer experience and productivity when working with databases.
- Secondary Goal: Provide a type-safe and performant ORM for modern application development.
- Tertiary Goal: Offer tools for database schema management and data exploration.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in Prisma components.
- Data integrity issues arising from ORM misconfigurations or bugs.
- Performance bottlenecks caused by inefficient database queries generated by Prisma.
- Vendor lock-in to Prisma ecosystem.
- Community support dependency and potential lack of long-term maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle (SDL) practices are likely followed by the Prisma team, including code reviews and testing. (Assumed based on project maturity and popularity).
- security control: Dependency scanning is likely used to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Assumed best practice for modern software projects).
- security control: Input validation is expected to be implemented within Prisma Client to prevent injection attacks. (Based on ORM functionality and common security practices).
- security control: Secure coding practices are expected to be followed by Prisma developers to minimize vulnerabilities. (Assumed based on project quality and community scrutiny).
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying database systems.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in generated database access code if not used correctly by developers.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security testing, including static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST), in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts.
- security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to allow the community to report security issues responsibly.
- security control: Provide security hardening guidelines for deploying and configuring Prisma in different environments.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Prisma itself does not handle application user authentication. It relies on the application layer to handle authentication and authorization.
    - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms should be used to access the database server from Prisma Client (e.g., strong passwords, certificate-based authentication).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Prisma should enforce database-level authorization based on the database user credentials provided.
    - Requirement: Application-level authorization logic should be implemented within the application code using Prisma Client to control access to specific data and operations.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Prisma Client must sanitize and validate all inputs before constructing database queries to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks.
    - Requirement: Prisma Migrate should validate schema migrations to prevent malicious or unintended database schema changes.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest in the database should be encrypted using database-level encryption features.
    - Requirement: Communication between Prisma Client and the database server should be encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: If Prisma needs to handle sensitive data in memory or logs, appropriate encryption or redaction techniques should be applied.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. CI/CD Pipeline fetches the latest code from the Version Control System.
4. CI/CD Pipeline builds the Application and generates the Prisma Client using the Prisma CLI in a controlled Build Environment.
5. Security scanners (SAST, Dependency Check) are executed in the Build Environment to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
6. If security checks pass, the CI/CD Pipeline publishes the build artifacts (e.g., Container Image) to an Artifact Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Version Control System: Secure access control to the repository, code review process, branch protection rules.
- security control: CI/CD Pipeline: Secure pipeline configuration, secret management for credentials, isolated build environment, audit logging of pipeline activities.
- security control: Build Environment: Hardened build environment, minimal tools installed, access control, regular patching.
- security control: Security Scanners (SAST, Dependency Check): Automated static code analysis, dependency vulnerability scanning, fail build on critical vulnerabilities.
- security control: Artifact Registry: Access control to the registry, vulnerability scanning of stored artifacts, immutable artifacts, audit logging of artifact access.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Application data access and management.
- Database schema migrations and updates.
- Application availability and performance relying on database interactions.

Data Sensitivity:
- The sensitivity of data handled by Prisma depends entirely on the application using it. Prisma itself is a tool and does not inherently handle sensitive data.
- Data sensitivity should be assessed based on the specific application and the type of data it stores in the database (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, health records).
- Prisma should be configured and used in a way that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, according to its sensitivity level.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of applications are primarily targeted for Prisma usage? (e.g., web applications, mobile backends, serverless functions).
- What is the typical deployment environment for Prisma-based applications? (e.g., cloud, on-premises, hybrid).
- What are the performance requirements for applications using Prisma?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that Prisma needs to adhere to? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).

Assumptions:
- Prisma follows secure software development lifecycle practices.
- Prisma is intended to be used in modern application architectures, potentially including cloud and containerized environments.
- Security is a significant consideration for the Prisma project and its users.
- Users of Prisma are expected to implement application-level security controls in addition to relying on Prisma's security features.
