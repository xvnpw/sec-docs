## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exposure via Prisma Studio - Critical Node & High-Risk Path (if enabled in production)](./attack_tree_paths/data_exposure_via_prisma_studio_-_critical_node_&_high-risk_path__if_enabled_in_production_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  If Prisma Studio is mistakenly enabled in production and not properly secured, it becomes a direct gateway to database data.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * **Never Enable Prisma Studio in Production:**  This is the most critical mitigation. Prisma Studio is a development tool and should be strictly disabled in production environments.
    * **Secure Prisma Studio in Development/Staging:** If used in non-production environments, secure access with strong authentication and network restrictions.

    * **Data Exfiltration via Prisma Studio UI or API - Critical Node:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  If unauthorized access to Prisma Studio is gained, attackers can directly exfiltrate sensitive data through the Studio's UI or API.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Prevent unauthorized access to Prisma Studio by disabling it in production and securing it in development/staging. Monitor access logs for Prisma Studio and detect any unusual activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Database Credential Compromise via Prisma Configuration - Critical Node & High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/database_credential_compromise_via_prisma_configuration_-_critical_node_&_high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Insecure storage or handling of database credentials used by Prisma, leading to credential theft and direct database access.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * **Secure Credential Storage:**
        * **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables, not directly in code or configuration files.
        * **Secrets Management:** Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to manage and access environment variables.
        * **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode credentials in `schema.prisma` or application code.
        * **Regular Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating database credentials.
    * **Restrict Access:** Limit access to configuration files and environment variable sources.

    * **Hardcoded Credentials in `schema.prisma` - Critical Node & High-Risk Path:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Developers mistakenly hardcode database credentials directly into the `schema.prisma` file.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Strictly prohibit hardcoding credentials. Implement code reviews and static code analysis to detect hardcoded secrets.

    * **Credentials in Version Control - Critical Node & High-Risk Path:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Accidental or intentional committing of database credentials to version control systems.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files. Implement secret scanning tools to detect committed secrets in version history. Educate developers about the risks of committing secrets.

    * **Insecure Environment Variables - Critical Node & High-Risk Path:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Environment variables containing database credentials are exposed due to server misconfiguration or insecure deployment practices.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Securely configure server environments. Use secure deployment practices and avoid exposing environment variables unnecessarily.

    * **Leaked Credentials via Logs or Error Messages - Critical Node & High-Risk Path:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Database credentials are inadvertently logged in application logs or exposed in error messages.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Implement proper logging practices. Sanitize logs to remove sensitive information, especially credentials. Configure error handling to avoid exposing sensitive data in error messages.

    * **Access Database Directly with Stolen Credentials - Critical Node & High-Risk Path:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Once credentials are compromised, attackers can bypass the Prisma layer and directly access and manipulate the database.
        * **Actionable Insights:**  Strong credential management is paramount. Implement database access monitoring and anomaly detection to identify unauthorized direct database access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Prisma Migrate Disruptions (Less Direct, but potential)](./attack_tree_paths/prisma_migrate_disruptions__less_direct__but_potential_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Disrupting the migration process can lead to application downtime or data corruption.

    * **Data Corruption via Malicious Migrations - Critical Node:**
