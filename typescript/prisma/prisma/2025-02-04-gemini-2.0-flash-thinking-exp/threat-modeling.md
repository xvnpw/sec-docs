# Threat Model Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Threat: [Unauthorized Schema Migrations](./threats/unauthorized_schema_migrations.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Prisma Migrate management interfaces or processes. They can then execute malicious database schema migrations, potentially corrupting data, introducing backdoors, or causing data loss. This directly leverages Prisma Migrate functionality for malicious purposes.
**Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, introduction of vulnerabilities, application instability, and potential complete system compromise.
**Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Migrate, Prisma Schema, Database.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to Prisma Migrate management commands and endpoints to authorized personnel only.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for migration execution.
* Use secure channels (e.g., SSH, VPN) for accessing migration environments.
* Review and test migrations thoroughly before deployment.
* Implement migration rollback procedures and regularly back up the database.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Migration Scripts](./threats/credential_exposure_in_migration_scripts.md)

**Description:** Database credentials or other sensitive information are inadvertently hardcoded or exposed within Prisma Migrate scripts, configuration files, or version control history. Attackers gaining access to these files can obtain credentials and compromise the database.  This is a direct consequence of how Prisma Migrate might be configured and used.
**Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, and potential complete system compromise.
**Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Migrate, Prisma Schema, Configuration Files, Version Control.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never hardcode credentials in migration scripts or configuration files.
* Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems to store and access credentials.
* Implement access controls on migration scripts and configuration files.
* Regularly scan code repositories for exposed secrets.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Prisma Studio/Admin UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_prisma_studioadmin_ui.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Prisma Studio or any exposed Prisma admin UI. This allows them to view, modify, or delete data directly, potentially bypassing application-level security controls. This directly targets Prisma's administrative tools.
**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized administrative actions, and potential compromise of the application and underlying data.
**Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Studio, Prisma Admin UI (if used).
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never expose Prisma Studio or admin UIs to public networks or the internet without strict access controls.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Prisma Studio/admin UIs.
* Use network segmentation or firewalls to restrict access to Prisma Studio/admin UIs to authorized internal networks only.
* Disable Prisma Studio in production environments if it's not actively needed for administration.

## Threat: [Insecure Connection String Management](./threats/insecure_connection_string_management.md)

**Description:** Database connection strings, which often contain sensitive credentials, are stored insecurely in application configurations used by Prisma. Attackers who gain access to these connection strings can directly access and compromise the database. This is directly related to how Prisma applications are configured to connect to databases.
**Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, and potential complete system compromise.
**Affected Prisma Component:** Application Configuration, Deployment Environment, Prisma Client.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never hardcode connection strings in application code or configuration files.
* Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and access connection strings.
* Restrict access to environment variables and secrets management systems to authorized personnel and processes.
* Avoid committing connection strings to version control systems.
