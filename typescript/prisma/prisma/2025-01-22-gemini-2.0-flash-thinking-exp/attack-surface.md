# Attack Surface Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Injection (if using Prisma with GraphQL)](./attack_surfaces/graphql_injection__if_using_prisma_with_graphql_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries to bypass authorization, access sensitive data, or cause denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in the GraphQL schema or resolvers *interacting with Prisma*. The complexity of Prisma-generated queries and GraphQL schema design can create injection points.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma's role in generating complex queries for GraphQL APIs, and the potential for developers to expose Prisma Client directly through GraphQL, makes it a direct contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a GraphQL query that bypasses row-level security policies defined in the application logic, gaining access to data they should not be able to see, by exploiting how Prisma resolves the query against the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data access, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design GraphQL schema with security in mind, considering how Prisma resolves queries.
    *   Implement robust authorization and authentication at the GraphQL layer, *before* Prisma queries are executed.
    *   Perform thorough input validation on GraphQL queries and variables *before* they reach Prisma.
    *   Utilize query complexity analysis and limits to prevent resource exhaustion from overly complex queries generated by Prisma.

## Attack Surface: [Migration Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/migration_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If migration scripts are dynamically generated based on untrusted input, attackers could inject malicious SQL or code into these scripts, leading to database compromise during migration execution *via Prisma Migrate*.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma Migrate's reliance on migration scripts to alter database schema makes it directly involved.  Dynamic script generation, while discouraged, becomes a Prisma-related risk when used.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates input data that is used to *generate a Prisma migration script*, injecting malicious SQL that drops a critical table during the migration process executed by Prisma Migrate.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, data loss, application disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Absolutely avoid* dynamic migration script generation based on untrusted input when using Prisma Migrate.
    *   Treat Prisma migration scripts as code and apply code review and security best practices.
    *   Sanitize and validate any input used in migration script generation (if absolutely necessary and strongly discouraged with Prisma Migrate).

## Attack Surface: [Prisma Studio Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/prisma_studio_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in *Prisma Studio's* authentication mechanisms could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Studio interface, enabling them to view, modify, or delete database data *through Prisma Studio*.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma Studio is a component of the Prisma ecosystem, and vulnerabilities within *its* authentication directly expose the database managed by Prisma.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in *Prisma Studio's* login process to bypass authentication and access the Studio interface without valid credentials, gaining control over database operations via Prisma Studio.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, data deletion, data integrity issues.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure *Prisma Studio* is properly secured with strong authentication.
    *   If exposing Studio publicly (generally not recommended for production), implement robust access control and consider using a reverse proxy with additional security measures like IP whitelisting or VPN access *specifically for Prisma Studio*.
    *   Keep *Prisma Studio* updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Database Connection Strings](./attack_surfaces/insecure_database_connection_strings.md)

*   **Description:** Storing database connection strings insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files, exposed environment variables) *used by Prisma* can lead to database compromise if these credentials are leaked.
*   **Prisma Contribution:** Prisma *requires* database connection strings to function. Insecure management of these strings, *directly impacting Prisma's ability to connect*, is a critical configuration vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Database connection strings *used by Prisma* are hardcoded in application code or stored in plain text configuration files that are accidentally exposed, allowing attackers to use these credentials to access the database *Prisma connects to*.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely manage database credentials *used by Prisma* using environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in code or configuration files *used by Prisma*.
    *   Ensure environment variables *used by Prisma* are not exposed in client-side code or logs.
