# Threat Model Analysis for prisma/prisma

## Threat: [Raw Query Injection](./threats/raw_query_injection.md)

**Description:** A developer uses `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe()` or `prisma.$executeRawUnsafe()` with unsanitized user input. An attacker can then inject malicious SQL or database commands through user-controlled input, bypassing Prisma's parameterized query protection and directly manipulating the database. This can lead to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Client (Raw Query Functions: `$queryRawUnsafe`, `$executeRawUnsafe`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using raw query methods (`$queryRawUnsafe`, `$executeRawUnsafe`) unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If raw queries are unavoidable, meticulously sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into the raw query string.
    *   Prefer using Prisma's query builder and parameterized queries whenever possible.

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection (with NoSQL Databases)](./threats/nosql_injection__with_nosql_databases_.md)

**Description:** When using Prisma with a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB), developers might construct queries that are vulnerable to NoSQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious operators or commands into user input that is used in Prisma queries, potentially bypassing intended query logic and gaining unauthorized access to data or manipulating data in unintended ways.
*   **Impact:** NoSQL Injection, Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service (depending on the NoSQL database and vulnerability).
*   **Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Client (Query Generation for NoSQL databases)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Understand NoSQL injection vulnerabilities specific to the chosen database.
    *   Sanitize and validate user input according to NoSQL database best practices.
    *   Utilize Prisma's query builder features to minimize raw query usage and reduce manual query construction errors.
    *   Follow security guidelines for the specific NoSQL database being used.

## Threat: [Prisma Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/prisma_dependency_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Prisma or its dependencies contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access, executing arbitrary code, or causing denial of service. This could be due to outdated Prisma versions or vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Core Libraries, Prisma Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Prisma and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Prisma and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and remediate vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for promptly addressing security updates.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Prisma Connection String](./threats/misconfigured_prisma_connection_string.md)

**Description:** A developer misconfigures the Prisma connection string, either in `schema.prisma` or environment variables. This could lead to Prisma connecting to the wrong database (e.g., development database in production), exposing database credentials in logs or configuration files, or using overly permissive database access credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized Database Access, Configuration Exposure.
*   **Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Client (Database Connection), Prisma Schema (`datasource` block).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely manage database connection strings and credentials.
    *   Use environment variables for database credentials and configuration.
    *   Ensure environment variables are not exposed in version control or logs.
    *   Use separate configuration files for different environments.
    *   Implement access control for configuration files and environment variables.
    *   Regularly review and audit Prisma connection configurations.

## Threat: [Exposed Prisma Studio in Production](./threats/exposed_prisma_studio_in_production.md)

**Description:** Prisma Studio, a development tool, is accidentally or intentionally exposed in a production environment. An attacker can access Prisma Studio through a publicly accessible URL. This provides them with a GUI to browse and manipulate database data, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or data deletion.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Database Access, Data Loss.
*   **Affected Prisma Component:** Prisma Studio.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Prisma Studio is disabled or not accessible in production deployments.
    *   Use environment variables or configuration settings to control Prisma Studio availability based on environment.
    *   Implement network-level restrictions to prevent access to Prisma Studio from public networks in production.
    *   Remove or disable Prisma Studio dependencies in production builds if possible.
