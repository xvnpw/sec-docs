## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Test Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_test_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to execute malicious code within the Jest test environment. This is critical because Jest runs in Node.js, potentially granting access to system resources and application data.

    *   **1.1. Malicious Test Code Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code that Jest executes during test runs.

        *   **1.1.1. Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Dependency) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Compromising a dependency used by the application or Jest itself. A malicious dependency can contain code that executes during test setup or within tests, compromising the environment.
            *   **Risk:** High - Increasingly common and difficult to detect.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
                *   Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): Maintain SBOMs to track dependencies.
                *   Lockfiles: Use lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions.
