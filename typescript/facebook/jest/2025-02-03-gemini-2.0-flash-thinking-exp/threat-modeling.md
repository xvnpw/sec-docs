# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/jest

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code](./threats/malicious_test_code.md)

- **Description:** An attacker (malicious insider or via compromised developer account) introduces malicious JavaScript code within test files. Jest executes this code during test runs. The attacker aims to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data from the testing environment, or disrupt the testing process.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, potentially leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of the testing infrastructure.
- **Jest Component Affected:** Test Files, Jest Runner
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement mandatory code reviews for all test files, focusing on identifying suspicious or unexpected code.
    - Utilize static analysis tools to scan test code for potentially malicious patterns or behaviors.
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege for test execution environments, limiting access to sensitive resources.
    - Provide security awareness training to developers, emphasizing the risks of including untrusted or malicious code in tests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Jest's Code Execution Engine](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_jest's_code_execution_engine.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities present within Jest's core JavaScript execution engine or related internal modules. By crafting specific test cases or inputs, they can trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to arbitrary code execution within the Jest process itself.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Jest process, potentially granting the attacker full control over the testing environment, CI/CD pipeline, or even the host system.
- **Jest Component Affected:** Jest Core, VM Environment (if applicable internally)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure Jest is consistently updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and vulnerability fixes.
    - Proactively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Jest and its direct dependencies.
    - Consider performing security code reviews or penetration testing on the Jest setup and usage within your environment (though core Jest vulnerability patching is primarily the responsibility of the Jest maintainers).

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_configuration_files.md)

- **Description:** An attacker, having compromised developer accounts or systems, maliciously modifies Jest configuration files (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`). They could inject malicious setup/teardown scripts, alter the test execution flow to bypass security checks, or introduce backdoors that are executed during Jest's initialization or runtime.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, manipulation of test results (potentially leading to undetected vulnerabilities in the application), denial of service, or complete compromise of the testing environment and potentially the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Jest Component Affected:** Jest Configuration Files (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access controls and permissions for Jest configuration files, limiting modification access to authorized personnel only.
    - Enforce version control and mandatory code review for *all* changes to Jest configuration files, treating them as critical code.
    - Implement integrity checks in CI/CD pipelines to verify the configuration files have not been tampered with before test execution.
    - Utilize configuration management tools to enforce consistent and securely configured Jest setups across projects and environments.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Options Leading to Code Execution](./threats/insecure_configuration_options_leading_to_code_execution.md)

- **Description:** Developers or operators inadvertently or unknowingly use insecure Jest configuration options that can be exploited by attackers. For example, overly permissive `testEnvironmentOptions` or misconfigured `setupFilesAfterEnv` could allow for the execution of arbitrary code if an attacker can influence the test environment or configuration.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Jest testing environment, potentially leading to environment compromise, data access, or disruption of testing processes.
- **Jest Component Affected:** Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`), Test Environment Setup
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly review and understand all Jest configuration options, especially those related to environment setup and code execution hooks.
    - Follow Jest's security best practices and recommendations for configuration, avoiding overly permissive or potentially dangerous settings.
    - Use linters or configuration validation tools to enforce secure configuration patterns and flag potentially insecure settings.
    - Regularly audit Jest configurations to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Jest Plugins/Reporters Leading to Code Execution](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_jest_pluginsreporters_leading_to_code_execution.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities within third-party Jest plugins, reporters, transformers, or other extensions. If these components are not properly vetted or maintained, they can contain vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution when Jest loads and executes them.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Jest process, potentially leading to compromise of the testing environment, information disclosure, or denial of service.
- **Jest Component Affected:** Jest Plugins, Reporters, Transformers, Extensions
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Exercise extreme caution when selecting and using third-party Jest plugins and extensions. Prioritize plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and security records.
    - Keep all Jest plugins and extensions updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Where possible, audit the code of plugins for security vulnerabilities before deployment, or rely on community security assessments and vulnerability reports.
    - Minimize the number of plugins and extensions used, only installing those that are strictly necessary for testing requirements.
