# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/jest

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Test Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_test_code_execution.md)

Description: Execution of arbitrary, potentially malicious JavaScript code embedded within Jest test files. This code is executed by the Jest runtime during test execution.
* Jest Contribution: Jest's core functionality is to execute JavaScript code provided in test files. It provides the environment and mechanisms for running this code, inherently creating an execution context.
* Example: A compromised developer commits a test file containing code that, when run by Jest, exfiltrates sensitive data from environment variables or local files to an external server.
* Impact: Local system compromise, credential theft, data exfiltration, denial of service attacks against local resources, and potential for indirect supply chain attacks by introducing vulnerabilities into tested code.
* Risk Severity: **Critical**
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Mandatory Code Review for Test Code: Implement rigorous code review processes for all test code changes, treating test code with the same security scrutiny as production code.
    * Principle of Least Privilege for Jest Process: Run Jest processes with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of malicious code execution. Avoid running tests as root or with elevated privileges.
    * Secure Development Practices Training: Educate developers on secure coding practices for test code, emphasizing the risks of including potentially harmful logic in tests.

## Attack Surface: [2. Configuration File Manipulation for Malicious Code Injection (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`)](./attack_surfaces/2__configuration_file_manipulation_for_malicious_code_injection___jest_config_js____package_json__.md)

Description: Unauthorized modification of Jest configuration files (`jest.config.js` or `package.json`) to inject malicious code that is executed by Jest during its operation. This primarily involves injecting malicious reporters or transforms.
* Jest Contribution: Jest relies on these configuration files to define its behavior, including the use of reporters and transforms. Jest directly processes and applies configurations defined in these files.
* Example: An attacker gains write access to the repository and modifies `jest.config.js` to register a malicious reporter. When Jest runs tests, this reporter is executed, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate source code or manipulate test results.
* Impact: Arbitrary code execution during test runs or report generation, injection of backdoors or vulnerabilities via transforms, data exfiltration (source code, test data), and manipulation of test outcomes.
* Risk Severity: **High**
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Access Control for Configuration Files: Restrict write access to repository files, especially `jest.config.js` and `package.json`, using version control and access management systems.
    * Version Control and Auditing of Configuration Changes: Track all changes to configuration files in version control and regularly audit these changes for suspicious or unauthorized modifications.
    * Immutable Infrastructure for CI/CD: In CI/CD environments, use immutable infrastructure to prevent runtime modification of configuration files, ensuring a consistent and controlled test environment.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Reporters](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_reporters.md)

Description: Exploiting Jest's custom reporter functionality by using or introducing malicious reporters that execute arbitrary code during the test reporting phase.
* Jest Contribution: Jest's architecture allows for custom reporters to extend its functionality. Jest executes these reporters as JavaScript code after test runs, providing an execution point.
* Example: A developer unknowingly installs a Jest reporter from an untrusted source that is advertised for enhanced reporting features. This reporter, when used by Jest, contains malicious code that exfiltrates test results and potentially source code to a remote server.
* Impact: Data exfiltration (test results, source code), arbitrary code execution during the reporting phase, potential for system compromise depending on the reporter's actions.
* Risk Severity: **High**
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Trusted Sources for Reporters: Only use Jest reporters from reputable and trusted sources. Verify the publisher's reputation and community feedback before using external reporters.
    * Code Review of Reporters: If using custom or less-known reporters, thoroughly review their source code for any malicious or suspicious behavior before integrating them into the project.
    * Dependency Scanning for Reporters: Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of any custom or external Jest reporters.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious Transforms](./attack_surfaces/4__malicious_transforms.md)

Description: Exploiting Jest's transform functionality by using or introducing malicious transforms that execute arbitrary code during the file preprocessing stage before tests are run.
* Jest Contribution: Jest uses transforms to preprocess files before testing (e.g., for transpilation). Jest executes these transforms as JavaScript code, providing an opportunity for malicious code execution during this preprocessing.
* Example: A compromised or malicious transform is configured in `jest.config.js`. This transform injects a backdoor into the code being tested *before* it is executed by Jest in the test environment, potentially also affecting the built application if transforms are reused in the build process.
* Impact: Injection of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the codebase, data exfiltration (source code), arbitrary code execution during the transformation process, potentially impacting both test and build environments.
* Risk Severity: **Critical**
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Trusted Sources for Transforms:  Use transforms only from highly trusted and well-vetted sources. Prefer established and widely used transforms maintained by reputable organizations or communities.
    * Rigorous Code Review of Transforms:  Conduct thorough code reviews of the source code for any custom or less-known transforms before using them. Pay close attention to any unexpected or suspicious actions within the transform code.
    * Dependency Scanning for Transforms:  Scan the dependencies of transforms for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools to identify and mitigate potential risks from vulnerable transform dependencies.
