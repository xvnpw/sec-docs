# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Jest, aims to provide a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and developer experience. It is designed to work out of the box, requiring minimal configuration, and offers rich features like mocking, snapshot testing, and code coverage.

- Business Priorities:
  - Ease of use and developer productivity.
  - Reliability and correctness of test execution.
  - Performance and speed of test runs.
  - Wide adoption and community support.

- Business Goals:
  - Become the leading JavaScript testing framework.
  - Enable developers to write and run tests efficiently.
  - Improve the quality and reliability of JavaScript software.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Jest could compromise developer environments or CI/CD pipelines.
  - Bugs in Jest could lead to false positive or false negative test results, impacting software quality.
  - Poor performance could deter adoption and developer satisfaction.
  - Lack of community support or maintainability could lead to project stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Jest, as an open-source project and a developer tool, has a unique security posture. It is not a directly deployed application but rather a library and CLI tool used in development environments.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository access control - Implemented via GitHub's permission system.
  - security control: Code review process - Implemented via GitHub pull requests and community contributions.
  - security control: Open-source community review - Implemented by the public nature of the repository and issue tracking.
  - security control: Dependency management - Implemented via `package-lock.json` or similar to manage dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - Accepted risk inherent in using third-party libraries.
  - accepted risk: Open-source vulnerability disclosure - Accepted risk that vulnerabilities might be publicly disclosed before a patch is available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Integrate tools like `npm audit` or `Dependabot` into CI/CD to automatically detect and report vulnerable dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into CI/CD to automatically scan Jest's codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Security focused code review guidelines - Establish and follow guidelines for code reviews that specifically address security considerations.
  - recommended security control: Security vulnerability reporting process - Clearly define a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy document.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Jest as a library. Authentication is relevant for contributors to the Jest project via GitHub authentication.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Jest as a library. Authorization is relevant for repository access control on GitHub.
  - Input Validation: Jest processes test files and configuration files as input. Input validation is crucial to prevent malicious test code or configuration from exploiting Jest. This is primarily the responsibility of the Jest core and test runner components.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Jest itself. However, if Jest is used in projects that handle sensitive data and require cryptographic operations in tests, Jest should not interfere with or weaken those operations.

# DESIGN

Jest's design is modular and plugin-based, allowing for extensibility and customization. It consists of a core engine, test runners, reporters, and configuration loading mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Process: Ensuring the quality and reliability of JavaScript software through effective testing. Jest is a critical tool for this process for many JavaScript development teams.
- Data to Protect:
  - Jest Source Code: Sensitivity - Medium (Intellectual property, maintaining project integrity).
  - Jest Build Artifacts (npm package): Sensitivity - Medium (Ensuring package integrity and preventing supply chain attacks).
  - Test Code (written by Jest users): Sensitivity - Low to Medium (Potentially contains business logic or sensitive information depending on the project, but generally less sensitive than production application code).
  - Jest Configuration: Sensitivity - Low (Configuration settings, generally not sensitive).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to maintain Jest as a leading, widely adopted, and reliable JavaScript testing framework.
  - Question: Are there specific business metrics used to measure the success of Jest (e.g., adoption rate, user satisfaction surveys)?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Current security practices rely heavily on GitHub's built-in features and open-source community review.
  - Question: Is there a formal security policy document for the Jest project?
  - Question: Are there any existing automated security scanning tools integrated into the Jest development process beyond GitHub's default checks?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: The C4 model is a suitable way to represent the architecture of Jest, even though it's a development tool rather than a deployed application.
  - Question: Are there any plans to further modularize or refactor Jest's architecture in the future that would impact the container diagram?
  - Question: Are there specific performance or scalability considerations that drive the design of Jest, especially regarding test execution speed?
