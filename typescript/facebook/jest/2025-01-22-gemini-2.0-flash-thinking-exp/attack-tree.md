## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Test Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to execute malicious code within the Jest test environment. This is critical because Jest runs in a Node.js environment, potentially with access to system resources and application data.
