# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/jest

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./threats/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  A developer, either maliciously or unknowingly, includes harmful JavaScript code within test files that are executed by Jest. Jest's core functionality as a test runner directly leads to the execution of this code. An attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary commands within the testing environment, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or compromising the development system.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the testing environment, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Jest Component Affected:** Test Runner (core Jest functionality)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory and rigorous code review for all test files, treating them with the same security scrutiny as production code.
    *   Automated static analysis of test files to detect suspicious code patterns or potentially malicious constructs before test execution.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the environment where Jest tests are executed, limiting the permissions available to the test process.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within test code, especially if tests interact with external data sources or user-provided input, to prevent injection attacks during test execution.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Jest's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_jest's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Jest relies on a complex ecosystem of npm packages. Vulnerabilities present in these direct or transitive dependencies can be exploited if Jest's code or user-written test code interacts with the vulnerable parts of these dependencies. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution or other malicious actions during Jest test runs, leveraging Jest's dependency resolution and execution environment.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the development environment, potentially leading to full system compromise, supply chain attacks, and data breaches.
*   **Jest Component Affected:** Dependency Management (npm packages, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`), Module Resolution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a process for regularly auditing and updating Jest and all its dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
    *   Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect and alert on vulnerabilities in Jest's dependencies before they are introduced into the project.
    *   Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for continuous monitoring of Jest's dependencies for newly discovered vulnerabilities and proactive risk management.
    *   Keep Node.js and npm/yarn (or your package manager) versions up-to-date to benefit from security patches and improvements in the underlying platform.

## Threat: [Malicious Jest Reporters, Transforms, or Presets](./threats/malicious_jest_reporters__transforms__or_presets.md)

*   **Description:** Jest's extensibility allows for the use of custom reporters, transforms, and presets, often installed from npm. A malicious actor could publish compromised npm packages disguised as legitimate Jest extensions. If developers unknowingly install and configure Jest to use these malicious components, Jest will execute the embedded malicious code during test runs as part of its normal workflow for reporting, code transformation, or preset configuration.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the development environment, supply chain compromise, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the development process and potentially production builds.
*   **Jest Component Affected:** Configuration Loading (`jest.config.js`, package resolution), Reporters, Transforms, Presets, Module Loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a strict vetting process for all custom Jest reporters, transforms, and presets before installation, including code review and security analysis.
    *   Prioritize using well-known, actively maintained, and reputable packages for Jest extensions, minimizing reliance on less established or unknown sources.
    *   Utilize package integrity checks (like `npm integrity` or `yarn integrity`) to verify that downloaded packages have not been tampered with during transit or on the npm registry.
    *   Consider establishing a private npm registry or using a package manager's features to curate and control the set of allowed packages within the development organization, limiting the risk of supply chain attacks through malicious Jest extensions.

## Threat: [Insecure Jest Configuration Leading to Code Execution](./threats/insecure_jest_configuration_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Jest's configuration files (`jest.config.js` or `package.json`) can create security vulnerabilities. For example, overly permissive `testMatch` patterns could inadvertently cause Jest to execute files not intended as tests, potentially including files containing malicious code or sensitive information. Incorrectly configured module paths or resolvers could lead Jest to load and execute unexpected or malicious modules during test setup or execution.
*   **Impact:** Unexpected or arbitrary code execution within the Jest environment, potentially leading to information disclosure, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Jest Component Affected:** Configuration Loading (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`), Module Resolver, Test Runner.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere strictly to Jest's documented best practices and security guidelines for configuration to minimize the risk of misconfigurations.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of Jest configuration files (`jest.config.js`, `package.json`) to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations or overly permissive settings.
    *   Implement version control for Jest configuration files to track changes, enable rollback to secure configurations, and facilitate code review of configuration modifications.
    *   Employ configuration validation tools or linters specifically designed for Jest configuration to automatically detect and flag potential misconfigurations or security weaknesses.
