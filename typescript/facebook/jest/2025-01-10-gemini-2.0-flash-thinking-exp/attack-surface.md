# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/jest

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code in Test Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_in_test_files.md)

**Description:** Test files can contain arbitrary JavaScript code that Jest executes. If malicious code is introduced, it can compromise the development environment or access sensitive information.

**How Jest Contributes:** Jest is the execution engine for these test files, directly running the code they contain.

**Example:** A developer with malicious intent adds a test file that reads environment variables containing API keys and sends them to an external server.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, compromise of development environment, potential supply chain attacks if malicious tests are committed and run in CI/CD.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous code reviews for all test files.
* Restrict write access to the test directory to authorized personnel.
* Utilize static analysis tools on test files to detect potentially malicious patterns.
* Employ a "shift-left security" approach, educating developers on secure testing practices.
* Consider running tests in isolated environments with limited access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Jest relies on a tree of dependencies (both direct and transitive). Vulnerabilities in any of these dependencies can be exploited when Jest uses the affected code paths.

**How Jest Contributes:** As a user of these dependencies, Jest becomes a potential vector for exploiting vulnerabilities within its dependency tree.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a widely used utility library that Jest depends on allows for remote code execution. If Jest's code interacts with the vulnerable part of the library, an attacker could exploit this.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit and update Jest and its dependencies to the latest versions.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Yarn audit, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
* Consider using lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock) to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Attack Surface: [`setupFiles` and `setupFilesAfterEnv` Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/_setupfiles__and__setupfilesafterenv__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** These Jest configuration options allow running arbitrary code before and after the test environment is set up. If these files contain malicious code, it will be executed by Jest.

**How Jest Contributes:** Jest explicitly executes the scripts specified in these configuration options.

**Example:** A developer adds a script to `setupFiles` that downloads and executes a malicious binary from an external source.

**Impact:** Compromise of the test environment, potential access to sensitive information, and the ability to perform arbitrary actions within the execution context.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat the files specified in `setupFiles` and `setupFilesAfterEnv` with the same scrutiny as application code.
* Implement code reviews for these files.
* Restrict write access to these files.
* Avoid performing actions in these files that are not strictly necessary for setting up the test environment.

## Attack Surface: [Integration with CI/CD Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/integration_with_cicd_pipelines.md)

**Description:** If Jest is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, vulnerabilities in the pipeline itself can be exploited to inject malicious tests or manipulate test results.

**How Jest Contributes:** Jest is the tool being executed within the CI/CD pipeline.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD system and modifies the pipeline configuration to inject a malicious test file that exfiltrates secrets before Jest runs the regular tests.

**Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code, compromise of the CI/CD environment, potential supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for CI/CD systems.
* Regularly audit CI/CD pipeline configurations.
* Use signed commits and verify the integrity of code before testing.
* Isolate the test environment within the CI/CD pipeline.
