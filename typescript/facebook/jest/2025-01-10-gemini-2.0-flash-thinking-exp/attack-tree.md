## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jest Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jest_configuration.md)

*   **Exploit Jest Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   This is a critical node because successfully exploiting Jest's configuration allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code early in the testing process, gaining significant control. It represents a high-risk path due to the potential for immediate and severe impact.
    *   **Inject Malicious Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   This specific step is critical as it directly leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code. It forms a core part of the high-risk path for exploiting Jest configuration.
        *   **Inject malicious code into jest.config.js or related files:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to the project's codebase, potentially through compromised developer credentials, a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline, or insecure file permissions. They then modify the `jest.config.js` file or other related configuration files.
            *   **Mechanism:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that will be executed by Node.js when Jest loads the configuration. This could involve adding a `require()` statement to a malicious script, defining a malicious function within the configuration, or manipulating other configuration options to execute code.
            *   **Impact:** Successful injection leads to arbitrary code execution within the Node.js environment where Jest runs. This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including reading sensitive environment variables, accessing the file system, making network requests, or even compromising the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Test Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_test_execution.md)

*   **Exploit Test Execution (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   This is a critical node because the test execution environment provides a direct pathway to execute code within the application's context. It represents a high-risk path due to the potential for significant impact through code execution during testing.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Tests (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   This step is critical as it directly introduces malicious code into the test execution flow. It forms a core part of the high-risk path for exploiting test execution.
        *   **Directly write malicious code within test files:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with access to the project's codebase directly modifies existing test files or creates new ones containing malicious code.
            *   **Mechanism:** The attacker writes JavaScript code within the test files that will be executed by Jest during the test run. This code can perform various malicious actions similar to those described in the configuration injection scenario.
            *   **Impact:** Successful injection leads to arbitrary code execution within the Node.js environment where Jest runs, potentially compromising the application's state or infrastructure.
        *   **Introduce malicious dependencies used by tests:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a dependency that is used by the test suite. This can be achieved through various means, including compromising a legitimate package on a public registry (supply chain attack) or exploiting known vulnerabilities in existing dependencies.
            *   **Mechanism:** When Jest runs the tests, it loads the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. If a malicious dependency is included, its code will be executed during the test setup or execution phase.
            *   **Impact:** Successful introduction of a malicious dependency can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities within the testing environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jest's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jest's_dependencies.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jest's Dependencies (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   This is a critical node because Jest relies on numerous third-party libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application. It represents a high-risk path due to the potential for widespread impact and the increasing prevalence of dependency-related attacks.
    *   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Jest's Dependencies:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers scan Jest's dependencies for publicly known vulnerabilities with available exploits.
        *   **Mechanism:** Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, attackers can craft exploits that leverage the specific weakness in that library. When Jest uses the vulnerable dependency, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes.
        *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the Node.js environment where Jest runs, potentially compromising the application or the testing infrastructure.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on Jest's Dependencies:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise a legitimate dependency of Jest. This often involves techniques like account takeover of a package maintainer, injecting malicious code into a popular package, or creating typosquatting packages.
        *   **Mechanism:** When developers install or update Jest's dependencies, they unknowingly pull in the compromised package. The malicious code within the dependency is then executed when Jest or the application utilizing Jest is run.
        *   **Impact:** Successful supply chain attacks can have a widespread impact, as the malicious code is executed in every environment where the compromised dependency is used. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other severe consequences.
