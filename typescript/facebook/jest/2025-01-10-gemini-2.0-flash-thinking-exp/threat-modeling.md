# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/jest

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./threats/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces malicious JavaScript code within a test file. Jest's test runner will then execute this code during the test run. This malicious code could perform actions like exfiltrating secrets, modifying files, or launching attacks on internal networks. This threat directly involves Jest's core functionality of running test code.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the testing environment, potential access to sensitive data (environment variables, credentials), and the possibility of using the testing environment as a stepping stone for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Jest's test runner (`jest-runner`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test files.
        *   Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on test code to detect suspicious patterns.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the testing environment, limiting access to sensitive resources.
        *   Implement robust access controls and multi-factor authentication for developer accounts and code repositories.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Jest Configuration Tampering](./threats/jest_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Jest Configuration Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `jest.config.js` or related configuration files and modifies them to introduce malicious behavior. This could involve altering module mappers to load malicious code, changing test environment settings to expose sensitive information, or modifying reporters to leak data. This directly involves Jest's configuration loading and application.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during test runs, exposure of sensitive information, and manipulation of test results.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Jest's configuration loading mechanism (`jest-config`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Jest configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Store Jest configuration files in version control and track changes.
        *   Implement code review for changes to Jest configuration files.
        *   Consider using environment variables or more secure methods for sensitive configuration values instead of hardcoding them in `jest.config.js`.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom Resolvers or Transforms](./threats/insecure_custom_resolvers_or_transforms.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Custom Resolvers or Transforms
    *   **Description:** Jest allows for custom resolvers and transforms to modify how modules are loaded and processed. An attacker could introduce a malicious resolver or transform that executes arbitrary code during the module resolution or transformation process. This is a direct feature of Jest's module system customization.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during test runs, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Jest's module resolution (`jest-resolve`) and transform (`jest-transform`) functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise caution when using custom resolvers or transforms.
        *   Thoroughly review the code of any custom resolvers or transforms for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the environment where resolvers and transforms execute.
