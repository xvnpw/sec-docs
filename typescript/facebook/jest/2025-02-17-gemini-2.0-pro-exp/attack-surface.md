# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/jest

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Mocks](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_mocks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into the application through compromised or manipulated Jest mocks.
*   **How Jest Contributes:** Jest's core mocking capabilities (`jest.mock()`, `jest.spyOn()`, etc.) are the *direct mechanism* for this attack.  These functions allow replacing real code with attacker-controlled substitutes.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a third-party mocking library. When tests run, the compromised library injects code that steals environment variables.  Alternatively, an attacker modifies a Jest configuration to redirect a mock to a malicious file.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:**  Mandatory, regular audits of *all* test dependencies (especially mocking libraries) using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot. Immediate remediation of any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Jest configurations and test setup files *must* be stored securely with restricted access.  Never commit sensitive configurations to public repositories.
    *   **Static Mock Paths:**  Strictly avoid dynamic mock paths or module names based on untrusted input.  Use static, hardcoded paths.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews for *all* test code, with a *specific focus* on the correct and safe use of mocking. Reviewers must be trained to identify suspicious mocking logic.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run tests with the absolute minimum necessary privileges. Never run tests as root or with administrator access.

## Attack Surface: [Test Environment Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/test_environment_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers alter the Jest test environment to bypass security controls or exploit environment-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **How Jest Contributes:** Jest's configuration options for the test environment (e.g., `testEnvironment`, custom environment settings) are the *direct attack vector*.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies `jest.config.js` to disable Node.js security features or switch to a vulnerable `jsdom` version.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security, exploiting environment vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution or data leakage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration File Integrity:** Treat Jest configuration files (like `jest.config.js`) as *critical* code. Secure storage, unauthorized change monitoring, and version control are mandatory. File integrity monitoring tools are recommended.
    *   **Environment Updates:**  Keep test environments (Node.js, `jsdom`, etc.) *strictly* up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Regular updates are crucial.
    *   **Minimal Environments:**  Use the *most minimal and secure* test environment possible. Avoid custom configurations unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement checks to *validate* the Jest configuration *before* running tests. This should detect insecure settings or unexpected changes.

## Attack Surface: [Snapshot Tampering](./attack_surfaces/snapshot_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify Jest snapshot files to introduce malicious code or mask vulnerabilities.
*   **How Jest Contributes:** Jest's snapshot testing feature *directly* creates and uses these modifiable files.
*   **Example:** An attacker alters a snapshot to include malicious JavaScript that would execute in the browser if the component were rendered.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution (potentially in the user's browser), data leakage, bypassing security.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Snapshot as Code:** Treat snapshot files *exactly* like source code. Store in version control and subject them to the *same* rigorous code review process.
    *   **Careful Review:**  Mandatory, *thorough* code reviews for *all* snapshot changes. Reviewers *must* be trained to spot suspicious modifications.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exclusion:**  Strictly avoid including sensitive data in components or functions subject to snapshot testing.
    *   **Automated Checks:** Use tools/scripts to automatically detect potential issues in snapshots (malicious patterns, unexpected changes in sensitive areas).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency-related_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Jest itself or its transitive dependencies are exploited.
*   **How Jest Contributes:** Jest, as a software package, *is* a dependency and *has* dependencies.  This is the inherent risk.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a library Jest uses for code coverage is exploited to execute code during the test run.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Jest and *all* its dependencies strictly up-to-date. Use a package manager and run updates regularly.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use dependency vulnerability scanners (`npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to *automatically* identify and report vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Locking:** Use lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) for consistent builds and to prevent unexpected dependency updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
