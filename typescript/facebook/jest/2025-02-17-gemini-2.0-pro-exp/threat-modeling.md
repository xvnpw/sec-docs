# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/jest

## Threat: [Execution of Untrusted Test Code](./threats/execution_of_untrusted_test_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Execution of Untrusted Test Code

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious JavaScript code disguised as a test case.  This is possible if Jest is configured (incorrectly) to run tests from external, untrusted sources. The attacker's code could perform actions like reading sensitive files, making network requests, or executing system commands *within the context of the Jest runner*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution on the test runner machine (which could be a developer's machine or a CI/CD server).
        *   Data exfiltration from the test environment.
        *   Potential lateral movement if the test environment has network access.
    *   **Jest Component Affected:** Jest runner, test file execution (`jest.run()`, CLI execution).  This is a direct threat because Jest is the engine executing the untrusted code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Source Control:**  *Never* configure Jest to run tests from untrusted sources. Only execute tests from trusted, version-controlled repositories.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run tests in a highly isolated environment (e.g., Docker container with minimal privileges and *no* network access to sensitive systems). This is crucial.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Limit resources (CPU, memory, network) available to the test execution environment.

## Threat: [Security Bypass via Mocking](./threats/security_bypass_via_mocking.md)

*   **Threat:** Security Bypass via Mocking

    *   **Description:** An attacker (malicious insider or compromised account) modifies test code to use Jest's mocking features (`jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`, etc.) to bypass security checks.  They mock security-critical functions to always return a successful result, effectively disabling security *within the Jest test run*. The most severe risk is accidental inclusion of this mocked code in production.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete bypass of security mechanisms during testing, leading to a false sense of security.
        *   *Critical* vulnerability if the mocked code is accidentally deployed to production (e.g., allowing unauthenticated access).
    *   **Jest Component Affected:**  Jest's mocking functions (`jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`, `jest.spyOn()`), module mocking system. This is a direct threat because it leverages Jest's core mocking capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Critical if mocked code reaches production)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Rigorous code review, specifically focusing on the *correct* and *safe* use of Jest mocks, especially around security functions.
        *   **Linter Rules:** Use linter rules or static analysis to detect overly permissive mocks or mocking of entire security modules.  This can help prevent accidental misuse.
        *   **Build Process Safeguards:** Implement checks in the build process to *prevent* test code (and especially mock files) from being included in production builds. This is a crucial mitigation.

## Threat: [Test Environment Compromise (via Jest)](./threats/test_environment_compromise__via_jest_.md)

*   **Threat:** Test Environment Compromise (via Jest)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the test code itself* or a *vulnerability within Jest or one of its direct dependencies* to gain control of the test execution environment. Because Jest is running the code, this is a direct threat. If the environment has access to sensitive resources, the attacker can pivot.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Full control over the test environment (which could be a developer machine or CI/CD server).
        *   Potential access to sensitive data and systems connected to the test environment.
    *   **Jest Component Affected:** Jest runner, test file execution, any *vulnerable* Jest plugin or *direct* dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Isolation:** Run tests in a *completely* isolated environment (e.g., Docker container, VM) with *no* network access to production systems or sensitive resources. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Use dedicated test accounts with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. Never use production credentials.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use lockfiles, regularly update Jest and its dependencies, and use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in *direct* Jest dependencies.

## Threat: [Compromised Jest Dependency (Direct Dependency)](./threats/compromised_jest_dependency__direct_dependency_.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Jest Dependency (Direct Dependency)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a package that Jest *directly* depends on. When Jest runs, the malicious code within the compromised *direct* dependency is executed *as part of Jest's operation*. This is distinct from a general supply chain attack; it's specifically about dependencies Jest itself uses.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution on the test runner machine (developer machine or CI/CD server).
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Compromise of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Jest Component Affected:** `node_modules`, specifically *direct* dependencies listed in Jest's `package.json`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Locking:** Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent builds.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Jest and all its *direct* dependencies updated. Apply security patches promptly.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools, focusing on Jest's *direct* dependencies, to identify known vulnerabilities.
        * **Vetting Dependencies:** Before updating Jest, check its release notes and any reported vulnerabilities in its updated dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Jest Plugin](./threats/malicious_jest_plugin.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Jest Plugin

    * **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Jest plugin to a public package repository. A developer installs and uses this plugin, and the malicious code executes *during Jest's test runs*, leveraging Jest's plugin architecture.
    * **Impact:**
    *   Code execution on the test runner machine (developer machine or CI/CD server).
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Compromise of CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Jest Component Affected:** Jest plugins (`setupFiles`, `setupFilesAfterEnv`, `reporters`, `testEnvironment`), custom reporters loaded by Jest. This is a direct threat because it exploits Jest's plugin mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Only install plugins from *highly trusted* sources (e.g., official Jest repositories, well-known and vetted developers).
    *   **Code Review:** If using a custom or less-known plugin, *thoroughly* review its code before use.
    *   **Limited Use:** Minimize the use of third-party Jest plugins, especially those with broad permissions.
    * **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore techniques for running plugins in a sandboxed environment (if technically feasible) to limit their access. This is a complex mitigation.
