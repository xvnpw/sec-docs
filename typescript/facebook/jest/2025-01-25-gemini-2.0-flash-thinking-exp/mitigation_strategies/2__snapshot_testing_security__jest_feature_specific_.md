#### 4.2. Threat Mitigation Effectiveness

*   **Malicious Jest Snapshot Tampering (Medium Severity):** The "Secure Review and Version Control of Jest Snapshots" strategy, when fully implemented, **significantly reduces** the risk of malicious snapshot tampering.  Components like "Mandatory Review of Jest Snapshot Diffs," "Clear Workflow for Jest Snapshot Updates," and "Automated Snapshot Diff Checks" are specifically designed to detect and prevent malicious modifications. Version control provides the necessary foundation for tracking and reverting changes.

*   **Accidental Bugs via Jest Snapshot Updates (Low to Medium Severity):** This strategy also **effectively mitigates** the risk of accidental bugs introduced through unintended snapshot updates. The emphasis on treating snapshots as code, mandatory review, and a clear workflow ensures that snapshot updates are deliberate and carefully considered, reducing the likelihood of introducing unintentional errors into the test suite.

#### 4.3. Impact

*   **Malicious Jest Snapshot Tampering:**  **Medium risk reduction** is a reasonable assessment. While no strategy can eliminate risk entirely, rigorous implementation of this mitigation strategy makes it significantly harder for attackers to successfully tamper with snapshots undetected. The layered approach of manual review, workflow enforcement, and potential automated checks provides multiple lines of defense.

*   **Accidental Bugs via Jest Snapshot Updates:** **Medium risk reduction** is also appropriate.  Improved processes and heightened awareness around snapshot changes substantially decrease the probability of introducing bugs through unintended updates.
