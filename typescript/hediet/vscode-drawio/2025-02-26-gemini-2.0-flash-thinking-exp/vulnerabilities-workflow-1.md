### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Loading Vulnerability**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Loading Vulnerability (formerly Plugin Loading Vulnerability via Absolute Path)
    - **Description:**
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript file intended to be loaded as a Draw.io plugin.
        2. The attacker gains control over the workspace settings, for example, by contributing to a shared repository and modifying the `.vscode/settings.json` file or by tricking a user into importing a malicious workspace configuration.
        3. In the compromised workspace settings, the attacker configures the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting to include an entry that specifies the absolute path or a workspace-relative path to the malicious JavaScript file.
        4. A victim user opens a Draw.io diagram file (e.g., `.drawio`, `.dio`, `.drawio.svg`, `.drawio.png`) within the compromised workspace in VS Code.
        5. The Draw.io extension reads the workspace settings and identifies the plugin configuration.
        6. If the plugin is new or has been modified, the extension displays a dialog prompting the user to allow or disallow loading the plugin from the specified path.
        7. If the victim user clicks "Allow" (either unknowingly or through social engineering), the extension proceeds to load and execute the malicious JavaScript code within the Draw.io editor webview.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension's webview context. This can lead to:
        - Information disclosure: Accessing sensitive workspace files, environment variables, or VS Code configurations.
        - Actions on behalf of the user: Modifying files, sending unauthorized network requests, or installing further malicious extensions.
        - Further exploitation: If vulnerabilities exist within the webview environment or VS Code itself, successful exploitation could lead to broader system compromise.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - Plugin Load Confirmation Dialog: When a new or modified plugin is detected, a dialog box prompts the user to explicitly allow or disallow its loading. This is implemented in the `getPlugins` method within `DrawioClientFactory.ts`. The dialog is shown using `window.showWarningMessage` when `this.config.isPluginAllowed` returns `undefined`, indicating an unknown plugin.
        - Known Plugins User Setting: The user's decision (Allow or Disallow) for each plugin is stored in the user settings (`hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins`). This setting includes the plugin's file path and a SHA256 fingerprint to verify plugin integrity and user consent for specific plugin versions. The `addKnownPlugin` and `isPluginAllowed` methods in `Config.ts` manage this setting. The fingerprint is generated using `sha256.hex(jsCode)` in `DrawioClientFactory.ts`.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Restrict Plugin Paths: The extension should be modified to only accept workspace-relative paths for plugin files, effectively disallowing absolute paths. This would prevent the loading of arbitrary files from outside the workspace, significantly reducing the attack surface. Path validation should be implemented in `Config.ts` within the `plugins` getter to ensure only workspace-relative paths are accepted.
        - Plugin Content Validation: Implement more robust validation of plugin content before execution. While validating JavaScript code is complex, basic checks for obviously malicious patterns or integrations with static analysis tools could be considered for future enhancements.
        - Sandboxing or strict API boundary: Implement sandboxing or a strict API boundary to isolate plugin code from core extension functionalities.
        - Code signature verification or deeper integrity checks: Implement additional verification measures (e.g. code signature verification or deeper integrity checks beyond the simple hash).
        - Improve user prompts: Improve user prompts to better convey the risks of loading unknown plugins, reducing accidental approval.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - Workspace Settings Control: The attacker must be able to influence the victim's workspace settings. This could be achieved through shared repositories or by social engineering to import malicious configurations.
        - User Interaction: The victim user must open a Draw.io diagram within the compromised workspace.
        - Plugin Approval: For new or modified plugins, the victim user must approve the plugin loading through the confirmation dialog.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - File: `/code/docs/plugins.md`: Documentation explicitly states that plugins can be loaded using absolute paths and `${workspaceFolder}` variable, confirming the functionality.
        - File: `/code/Config.ts`:
            ```typescript
            public get plugins(): { file: Uri }[] {
                return this._plugins.get().map((entry) => {
                    const fullFilePath = this.evaluateTemplate(entry.file, "plugins");
                    return { file: Uri.file(fullFilePath) };
                });
            }
            ```
            The `DiagramConfig.plugins` getter retrieves plugin configurations from settings. It uses `evaluateTemplate` to process file paths, which supports `${workspaceFolder}` but does not restrict paths to be workspace-relative. This allows absolute paths to be used as plugin file locations, as configured in `settings.json`. The `VsCodeSetting` class (and underlying VS Code settings API) is used for reading settings, but it lacks path validation or restrictions, allowing absolute paths to be accepted as plugin file locations.
        - File: `/code/src/DrawioClient/DrawioClientFactory.ts`:
            ```typescript
            private async getPlugins(
                config: DiagramConfig
            ): Promise<{ jsCode: string }[]> {
                // ...
                for (const p of config.plugins) {
                    let jsCode: string;
                    try {
                        jsCode = BufferImpl.from(
                            await workspace.fs.readFile(p.file)
                        ).toString("utf-8");
                        // ...
                    } catch (e) {
                        window.showErrorMessage(
                            `Could not read plugin file "${p.file}"!`
                        );
                        continue;
                    }
                    // ...
                    const isAllowed = this.config.isPluginAllowed(
                        pluginId,
                        fingerprint
                    );
                    if (isAllowed) {
                        pluginsToLoad.push({ jsCode });
                    } else if (isAllowed === undefined) {
                        // ... Show confirmation dialog ...
                    }
                }
                // ...
            }
            ```
            The `getPlugins` method in `DrawioClientFactory.ts` iterates through configured plugins (`config.plugins`). For each plugin `p`, it reads the plugin file content using `workspace.fs.readFile(p.file)`.  The `p.file` here is a `Uri` object created from the potentially absolute path specified in settings, which is then directly used to read the file. This is where the absolute path is processed and the file content is loaded if the user allows it. The code proceeds to check if the plugin is allowed using `this.config.isPluginAllowed` and shows a confirmation dialog if it's a new or modified plugin. If allowed, the `jsCode` is added to `pluginsToLoad`.

              A[VS Code Workspace] --> B(settings.json);
              B --> C{DrawioClientFactory.ts: getPlugins()};
              C --> D{Config.ts: isPluginAllowed()};
              D -- Allowed --> E[Read Plugin File];
              E --> F[DrawioClient.ts: configure action];
              F --> G[Draw.io Webview];
              G -- Plugin Code Execution --> H[Arbitrary Code Execution]
          ```
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Setup:
            - Create a new workspace in VS Code.
            - Create a directory named `.vscode` at the root of the workspace.
            - Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
            - Create a malicious JavaScript file named `malicious_plugin.js` and place it in a known location on your system outside the workspace, for example, `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js`. The content of `malicious_plugin.js` should be:
              ```javascript
              Draw.loadPlugin(function (ui) {
                  alert('Malicious plugin executed! Workspace path: ' + vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.path);
                  // You can add more harmful actions here for testing, like file access or data exfiltration.
              });
              ```
        2. Configure Workspace Settings:
            - Open `.vscode/settings.json` and add the following configuration, replacing `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js` with the actual path to your malicious plugin file:
              ```json
              {
                  "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins": [
                      {
                          "file": "/tmp/malicious_plugin.js"
                      }
                  ]
              }
              ```
        3. Create Draw.io Diagram:
            - Create an empty file named `test.drawio` at the root of the workspace.
        4. Open Draw.io Diagram:
            - Open `test.drawio` in VS Code using the Draw.io editor.
        5. Observe Plugin Load Dialog:
            - A dialog box will appear, prompting you to allow or disallow loading the plugin from `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js`.
        6. Allow Plugin Execution:
            - Click "Allow" in the dialog.
        7. Verify Code Execution:
            - An alert box with the message "Malicious plugin executed! Workspace path: ..." will appear within the Draw.io editor. The workspace path in the alert confirms code execution within the webview context and access to VS Code API (e.g., `vscode.workspace`).

- **Vulnerability 2: Inadequate Content Security Policy (CSP) in Online Mode**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Inadequate Content Security Policy (CSP) in Online Mode
    - **Description:**
        In online mode the extension builds an HTML wrapper (in the `getOnlineHtml` method of the DrawioClientFactory) that embeds an iframe with a very permissive CSP. The meta tag is hard‑coded to allow wildcards and both `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` (e.g. `default-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; …`). An attacker who controls (or is able to intercept/modify) the remote URL’s content can inject arbitrary JavaScript. When that iframe loads in the VS Code webview, the malicious code executes in a privileged context.
    - **Impact:**
        - Arbitrary code execution inside the webview can lead to data exfiltration (e.g. access to user documents or workspace information), diagram manipulation, or even triggering undesired VS Code commands.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - By default the extension uses offline mode (with locally bundled draw.io assets). However, in online mode no additional validation, URL whitelisting, or a stricter CSP is enforced.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Implement a much more restrictive CSP that removes wildcards and disallows both `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.
        - Validate that any externally provided URL belongs to a trusted source (e.g. enforcing a whitelist).
    - **Preconditions:**
        - The user must configure the extension to use online mode (by setting `"hediet.vscode-drawio.offline": false` and providing an `"online-url"` in settings).
        - An attacker must either control the remote URL or be able to conduct a man‑in‑the‑middle attack to modify the served content.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - In `/code/src/DrawioClient/DrawioClientFactory.ts`, the `getOnlineHtml` method returns an HTML document whose `<meta>` tag defines a CSP as follows:
          ```html
          <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src * 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src *; style-src * 'unsafe-inline'; worker-src * data: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; font-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';">
          ```
        - No verification or restrictions (such as domain validation) are applied before the remote content is embedded into the webview.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. In a controlled test environment, configure the extension settings so that:
            - `"hediet.vscode-drawio.offline": false`
            - `"online-url": "https://malicious.example.com/"` (with malicious.example.com serving a page that includes an inline script, such as one that triggers an alert)
        2. Open a draw.io file using the extension to force the webview to load the online URL.
        3. Verify that the injected malicious script executes (e.g. an alert dialog or console log appears).
        4. Apply a tighter CSP in the code and confirm that the injected script is blocked.

- **Vulnerability 3: Inadequate Sanitization of Liveshare Session Data Leading to Code Injection**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Inadequate Sanitization of Liveshare Session Data Leading to Code Injection
    - **Description:**
        The extension’s Liveshare integration gathers view state updates from remote peers (such as cursor positions, selected cell IDs, and rectangles) and passes them directly to the Draw.io client via the `updateLiveshareViewState` command. There is no sanitization or validation of these inputs before they are forwarded. An attacker who joins a Liveshare session can craft malicious view state data (for example, inserting payloads like `"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"` into fields such as `selectedCellIds` or labels) that will be relayed to the Draw.io webview and processed by the Draw.io client potentially in an unsafe manner.
    - **Impact:**
        - A malicious peer in a Liveshare session can achieve arbitrary code execution within the Draw.io webview context. This may lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized modifications within VS Code, or further compromise of the user’s local environment.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - No input validation or sanitization is performed on session update data received via the Liveshare API. The raw view state from peers is accepted and forwarded to the Draw.io client.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Implement strict validation and sanitization for all Liveshare session data before it is forwarded to the Draw.io client.
        - Enforce proper escaping or use a whitelist to allow only expected characters and formats in view state fields.
        - Optionally, incorporate additional verification to ensure that only authenticated and trusted peers’ data is processed.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - The extension must be operating within a Liveshare session that permits peers to join (using a shared link with insufficient peer verification).
        - The attacker must join the Liveshare session as a peer and be able to send crafted view state updates.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - In `SessionModel.ts`, the `apply` method stores incoming session updates directly from the Liveshare API without filtering.
        - In `LiveshareSession.ts`, the method `updateLiveshareOverlaysInDrawio(editor)` aggregates view state data from `this.sessionModel.viewStatesByPeerId` and passes it to `editor.drawioClient.updateLiveshareViewState` without any sanitization.
        - Within `CustomizedDrawioClient` (in `/code/src/DrawioClient/CustomizedDrawioClient.ts`), the `updateLiveshareViewState` method simply calls `sendCustomAction` to relay the payload to the webview.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Start a Liveshare session with two participants (an honest user and an attacker-controlled peer).
        2. As the attacker, use the Liveshare API to send a crafted session update where one or more view state fields (e.g. `selectedCellIds`) include a malicious payload such as `"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"`.
        3. Verify that the malicious update is received by the extension’s Liveshare session handler and then forwarded to the Draw.io client via `updateLiveshareViewState`.
        4. Observe (within the webview context) that the payload is rendered and the malicious code executes (for example, an alert dialog appears).
        5. After applying proper sanitization to the view state data, confirm that the malicious payload is neutralized and does not trigger code execution.

- **Vulnerability 4: Potential File Path Traversal and Arbitrary File Opening via Code Link Feature**

    - **Vulnerability Name:** Potential File Path Traversal and Arbitrary File Opening via Code Link Feature
    - **Description:** The Code Link feature allows diagram nodes to link to code symbols or files using labels starting with `#`. Insufficient sanitization of these labels could allow path traversal attacks. By crafting a malicious Draw.io diagram with labels like `#../../../sensitive.txt`, an attacker might trick the extension into attempting to open files outside the workspace.
    - **Impact:** Potential information disclosure by opening sensitive files outside the workspace within VS Code's restricted "Open File" capabilities. Limited arbitrary file opening within user-accessible files.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Workspace scope of VS Code's API for symbol search and file opening provides some implicit mitigation.
    - **Missing Mitigations:** Explicit path traversal prevention by sanitizing node labels. Enforcement of workspace boundaries when resolving file paths from code links.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - Attacker creates a malicious Draw.io diagram with node labels containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`).
        - User opens the diagram in VS Code with Code Link enabled.
        - User double-clicks a node with the malicious label.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - `docs/code-link.md`: Feature documentation, lacks security considerations.
        - `src/features/CodeLinkFeature.ts`: `handleDrawioEditor` processes `onNodeSelected` events. It extracts symbol names and file paths from labels. `revealSelection` uses `workspace.openTextDocument`, `window.showTextDocument`, and `commands.executeCommand("vscode.open", pos.uri, ...)` to open files. Path validation in `CodePosition.deserialize` and `resolveWorkspaceSymbol` needs verification.
        - Visualization:
          ```mermaid
          graph LR
              A[Draw.io Diagram] --> B{Node with malicious label};
              B -- Double Click --> C[CodeLinkFeature.ts: handleDrawioEditor()];
              C --> D[CodePosition.deserialize()];
              D --> E[resolveWorkspaceSymbol()];
              E --> F[vscode.open command];
              F --> G[Attempt to open file (path traversal)]
          ```
    - **Security Test Case:**
        1. Create a new VS Code workspace.
        2. Create `sensitive.txt` in user's home directory (outside workspace).
        3. Create `test-codelink.drawio` in workspace.
        4. Open `test-codelink.drawio` in Draw.io editor.
        5. Create a node, label it `#../../../sensitive.txt` (adjust `../` count).
        6. Enable Code Link.
        7. Double-click the node.
        8. Observe if `sensitive.txt` opens and displays content.
