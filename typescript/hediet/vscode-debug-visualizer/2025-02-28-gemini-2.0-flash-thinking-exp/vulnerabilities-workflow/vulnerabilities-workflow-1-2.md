### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Remote Code Execution via Custom Visualizer Scripts

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious JavaScript file.
    2. The attacker tricks a victim into opening a workspace and configuring the `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` setting in VS Code to point to the malicious JavaScript file. This can be achieved by providing a malicious `settings.json` file within the workspace.
    3. The victim activates the Debug Visualizer extension and opens a new visualization view.
    4. The VS Code Debug Visualizer extension reads the file path from the `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` setting.
    5. The extension reads the content of the malicious JavaScript file and sends it to the webview via the `setCustomVisualizerScript` RPC call.
    6. The webview receives the malicious script and executes it using `eval()`.
    7. The malicious JavaScript code executes within the webview context, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the VS Code extension.

- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the VS Code extension's webview context.
    - Potential access to sensitive information managed by the VS Code extension.
    - Potential modification of workspace files.
    - Potential execution of arbitrary commands within the user's VS Code environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension currently allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code from user-configured file paths without any sanitization or security checks.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the content of custom visualizer scripts to prevent execution of malicious code. However, due to the nature of JavaScript and the requirement for dynamic code execution for custom visualizers, full sanitization might be challenging.
    - **Sandboxing:** Execute custom visualizer scripts in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of malicious scripts.
    - **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Conduct thorough code reviews and static analysis of the codebase, especially the parts handling custom scripts, to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Minimize the privileges granted to the webview context to limit the impact of a successful RCE.
    - **User Awareness:** Educate users about the risks of adding untrusted file paths to the `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` setting. Provide clear warnings in the documentation.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim must open a workspace controlled by the attacker or be tricked into modifying their workspace settings to include a malicious file path in `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths`.
    - The Debug Visualizer extension must be active and a visualization view must be opened.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/webview/src/model/Model.ts`
    ```typescript
    setCustomVisualizerScript: async ({ id, jsSource }) => {
        eval(`
            ((load) => {
                let fn = undefined;
                if (load) {
                    const module = {};
                    load(module);
                    fn = module.exports;
                }
                setVisualizationModule(${JSON.stringify(id)}, fn);
            })(
                ${jsSource ? `function (module) { ${jsSource} }` : "undefined"}
            )
        `);
    },
    ```
    The `setCustomVisualizerScript` function in `Model.ts` uses `eval()` to execute the `jsSource` received from the extension. This code is intended to load custom visualization scripts. However, `eval()` is inherently dangerous as it executes any JavaScript code provided as a string.

    2. File: `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewConnection.ts`
    ```typescript
    client.setCustomVisualizerScript({
        id: file.path,
        jsSource: file.content || null,
    });
    ```
    The `WebviewConnection.ts` takes the content of the custom visualizer script file (`file.content`) and directly sends it to the webview via the `setCustomVisualizerScript` RPC call without any sanitization.

    3. File: `/code/extension/src/Config.ts`
    ```typescript
    private readonly _customVisualizerScriptPaths = new VsCodeSetting(
        "debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths",
        { serializer: serializerWithDefault<string[]>([]) }
    );

    public get customVisualizerScriptPaths(): string[] {
        return this._customVisualizerScriptPaths.get().map((p) => {
            const tpl = new SimpleTemplate(p);
            return tpl.render({ /* ... */ });
        });
    }
    ```
    The `Config.ts` reads the file paths from the `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` setting. These paths are directly used to read file content and send to the webview.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder named `malicious-workspace`.
    2. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `.vscode/settings.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths": [
            "${workspaceFolder}/malicious-visualizer.js"
        ]
    }
    ```
    3. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `malicious-visualizer.js` with the following content:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = (register, helpers) => {
        register({
            id: "malicious-code",
            getExtractions: (data, collector) => {
                const vscode = require('vscode');
                vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Malicious code executed in Debug Visualizer Webview!');
            }
        });
    };
    ```
    4. Open VS Code and open the `malicious-workspace` folder.
    5. Open a new Debug Visualizer view using the command `Debug Visualizer: New View`.
    6. Observe that an error message "Malicious code executed in Debug Visualizer Webview!" is displayed, confirming that the code from `malicious-visualizer.js` has been executed within the webview context.
