* Vulnerability 1
    * Vulnerability Name: Insecure WebSocket Authentication via URL Parameter
    * Description: The Debug Visualizer extension uses a WebSocket connection for communication between the extension backend and the webview frontend. Authentication for this connection relies on a secret token passed as a URL parameter in the webview URL. This method of secret transmission is insecure as URL parameters are easily exposed through browser history, network traffic, and server logs. An attacker who can observe this URL can extract the secret and potentially gain unauthorized access to the WebSocket server.
    * Impact: High - Unauthorized access to the WebSocket server would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the debugging context. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure from the debug session, manipulation of the debug session state, or other malicious actions executed in the context of the user's debugging environment.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. While a random secret is generated for each session, the insecure transmission method through URL parameters negates any security benefit.
    * Missing Mitigations: A secure secret transmission mechanism is missing. Recommended mitigations include:
        * Using HTTPS for serving the webview content to encrypt the communication channel, although this might be complex to set up within a VS Code extension context.
        * Implementing a more robust authentication handshake for the WebSocket connection that does not rely on passing the secret in the URL. For example, the initial connection could be unauthenticated, followed by a secure exchange (perhaps using a challenge-response mechanism) to establish a secure session.
    * Preconditions:
        * A Debug Visualizer view must be opened.
        * The attacker needs to be able to observe the URL used to open the Debug Visualizer webview. This could be achieved by:
            * Network sniffing to capture network traffic when the webview is loaded.
            * Accessing the user's browser history.
            * Analyzing server logs if the webview URL is inadvertently logged by any intermediate systems.
    * Source Code Analysis:
        1. Secret Generation: In `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewServer.ts`, a random secret is generated using `cryptoRandomString` and stored in `this.secret`.
        2. URL Construction: The `getWebviewPageUrl` method in `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewServer.ts` constructs the webview URL. Crucially, it appends the secret as a URL parameter:
        ```typescript
        public getWebviewPageUrl(args: { ... }): string {
            ...
            const params: Record<string, string> = {
                serverPort: this.port.toString(),
                serverSecret: this.secret, // Secret is added as URL parameter
                mode: args.mode,
                theme: this.config.theme,
            };
            ...
            return `http://localhost:${port}/index.html?${new URLSearchParams(params).toString()}`;
        }
        ```
        3. HTML Injection: In `/code/extension/src/webview/InternalWebviewManager.ts`, the `getDebugVisualizerWebviewHtml` function calls `server.getWebviewPageUrl` to obtain the URL, including the secret, and injects it into the webview's HTML content, which is then loaded by VS Code.
        4. Webview Secret Retrieval: In `/code/webview/src/model/Model.ts`, the webview's frontend code retrieves the secret from the URL using `window.location.href` in the constructor.
        5. Authentication Check: In `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewConnection.ts`, the `authenticate` method in the WebSocket server verifies the received secret against the server-side secret:
        ```typescript
        authenticate: async ({ secret }, { newErr }) => {
            if (secret !== serverSecret) { // Secret is compared here
                return newErr({ errorMessage: "Invalid Secret" });
            } else {
                authenticated = true;
            }
        },
        ```
    * Security Test Case:
        1. Prerequisites:
            * VS Code with Debug Visualizer extension installed.
            * A simple JavaScript or TypeScript project open in VS Code to start a debug session.
        2. Steps:
            * Start a debug session in VS Code.
            * Open a Debug Visualizer view by executing the command `Debug Visualizer: New View`.
            * Immediately after opening the view, before interacting with it, carefully examine the URL of the newly opened webview. This can be done by:
                * If the webview opens in an external browser (due to configuration or by manually popping it out), the URL is directly visible in the browser's address bar.
                * If the webview is embedded within VS Code, you may need to use developer tools within VS Code's webview host (if available and accessible) or use external tools to monitor network traffic originating from VS Code to capture the URL request.
            * Locate the `serverSecret` parameter in the URL. Copy the value of this parameter.
            * Close the Debug Visualizer view to terminate the current WebSocket connection.
            * Open a WebSocket client (e.g., a browser-based WebSocket client or a command-line tool like `wscat`).
            * Attempt to establish a WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:<port>` where `<port>` is the port number observed in the webview URL (parameter `serverPort`).
            * Once the WebSocket connection is established, send a JSON message to the server to attempt authentication, replacing `<secret>` with the `serverSecret` value you copied from the URL:
            ```json
            {
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "id": 1,
                "method": "authenticate",
                "params": {
                    "secret": "<secret>"
                }
            }
            ```
            * Observe the response from the WebSocket server. A successful authentication will typically not return an error. After successful authentication, attempt to send other commands, such as `refresh` or `setExpression`, to the WebSocket server. If you receive valid responses and the extension reacts accordingly (e.g., refreshing the view or attempting to evaluate a new expression), it confirms that you have successfully bypassed the intended webview security using the exposed secret.
