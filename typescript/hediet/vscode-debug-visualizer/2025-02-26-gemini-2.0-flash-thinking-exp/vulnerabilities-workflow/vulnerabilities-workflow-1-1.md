### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Code Injection via Custom Visualizer Scripts

* Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the VS Code workspace settings of a user to include a malicious JavaScript file path in the `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` setting.
    2. When the user starts debugging a JavaScript/TypeScript project using a supported debug adapter (`node`, `node2`, `extensionHost`, `chrome` or `pwa-chrome`), the VS Code Debug Visualizer extension reads the `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` setting.
    3. For each path in this setting, the extension attempts to load and execute the JavaScript file using `debugSession.evaluate` within the context of the **debuggee (extension host)**.
    4. If the attacker provides a path to a malicious JavaScript file, the code within this file will be executed within the extension host process when a debugging session starts.
    5. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the extension host environment, potentially gaining full access to the VS Code environment, including file system access, access to secrets, and ability to execute commands as the user running VS Code. This is a significantly more severe vulnerability than webview-only code injection.

* Impact:
    * **Critical**
    * Arbitrary code execution in the **extension host process**.
    * Full control over the VS Code environment with user's privileges.
    * Ability to read and write files, access secrets, install malicious extensions, and perform any action that the user running VS Code can perform.
    * Complete compromise of the user's VS Code environment and potentially the underlying system.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The extension directly loads and executes JavaScript files specified in the `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` setting without any validation or sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Input Validation:** The extension must validate the paths provided in `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths`. Paths should be strictly restricted to a safe, controlled location, ideally within the extension's own storage, or the feature should be removed entirely.  Preventing access to arbitrary files on the user's system is crucial.
    * **Code Review and Removal of Feature:** Executing arbitrary user-provided scripts within the extension host is inherently dangerous. A thorough security code review is needed, and the functionality of executing custom scripts should be re-evaluated. If it is not absolutely essential, it should be removed to eliminate this critical code injection risk.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** The extension should operate with the minimal privileges necessary. Executing arbitrary user-provided scripts in the extension host violates this principle and grants excessive privileges to potentially malicious code.

* Preconditions:
    * The attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings (e.g., through a malicious repository, project, or by social engineering).
    * The user must open a workspace with the malicious `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` configuration.
    * The user must start a debugging session for a supported language (JavaScript/TypeScript).
    * Custom scripts must be enabled via `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` setting.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/extension/src/Config.ts`**: This file reads the `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths` configuration from VS Code settings.
    ```typescript
    public readonly customScriptPaths = this._customScriptPaths.get().map((p) => { ... });
    ```
    `customScriptPaths` is obtained from `VsCodeSetting` and then mapped using `SimpleTemplate` for workspace folder variable substitution.

    2. **File: `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewConnection.ts`**: The `FileWatcher` is used to monitor changes in `customScriptPaths`. However, this class is related to webview communication, and while it uses `FileWatcher`, the actual execution happens in `JsVisualizationSupport.ts`. This file is **not** the primary source of the vulnerability execution in extension host, but it is part of the configuration flow.

    3. **File: `/code/extension/src/VisualizationBackend/JsVisualizationSupport.ts`**: The `CustomScripts` class within `JsVisualizationSupport.ts` is the crucial part. It uses `FileWatcher` to monitor `config.customScriptPaths` and then executes the scripts using `debugSession.evaluate`.
    ```typescript
    class CustomScripts {
        // ...
        constructor(
            debugSession: DebugSessionProxy, // Debug session proxy
            debuggerView: DebuggerViewProxy,
            config: Config,
            changeHandler: () => void
        ) {
            this.dispose.track(
                new FileWatcher(
                    () => config.customScriptPaths,
                    async (files) => {
                        for (const file of files) {
                            // ...
                            let expression = `
                            (
                                runCode => { // Wraps script in a function
                                    let fn = undefined;
                                    if (runCode) {
                                        const module = {};
                                        runCode(module);
                                        fn = module.exports;
                                    }
                                    ${getExpressionForDataExtractorApi()}.setDataExtractorFn(
                                        ${JSON.stringify(file.path)},
                                        fn
                                    );
                                }
                            )
                            (
                                ${file.content === undefined ? "undefined" : `function (module) { ${file.content} }`} // Injects file content as function body
                            )`;

                            try {
                                await debugSession.evaluate({ // Executes in debuggee context (extension host)
                                    expression,
                                    frameId: debuggerView.getActiveStackFrameId(debugSession),
                                    context: "repl",
                                });
                            } catch (e: any) {
                                // ... error handling
                            }
                        }
                        changeHandler();
                    }
                )
            );
        }
    }
    ```
    The code clearly shows that the content of the files specified in `customScriptPaths` is being evaluated using `debugSession.evaluate`. This execution happens in the context of the debug session, which for `extensionHost` debug type, is the extension host itself.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Extension (Config.ts) --> Reads debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths from settings
        --> Extension (VisualizationBackend/JsVisualizationSupport.ts - CustomScripts) --> FileWatcher monitors script paths
            --> Extension (VisualizationBackend/JsVisualizationSupport.ts - CustomScripts) --> Uses debugSession.evaluate(jsContent)  <-- VULNERABILITY: Arbitrary code execution in extension host
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious JavaScript file named `malicious-script.js` in a location accessible from your workspace (e.g., workspace root). The content should execute code in the extension host context. For example, to demonstrate extension host code execution, write to a file in the workspace root.
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        fs.writeFileSync('pwned-extension-host.txt', 'You have been PWNED by extension host script!');
        ```
    2. Open a VS Code workspace.
    3. Modify the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) to include the path to `malicious-script.js` in `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths`. The setting would look like this:
        ```json
        {
            "debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/malicious-script.js"
            ]
        }
        ```
    4. Create a simple JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace.
    5. Start debugging `test.js` using the "Node.js Debug configuration".
    6. Wait for the debugger to connect. You don't even need to hit a breakpoint or open the Debug Visualizer view in this case, as the custom scripts are loaded as soon as the debug session starts for supported debuggers.
    7. Observe that a file named `pwned-extension-host.txt` is created in your workspace root. This confirms that the malicious code from `malicious-script.js` (loaded via `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths`) was executed within the extension host context.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Implement robust path validation for `debugVisualizer.js.customScriptPaths`. Restrict paths to a safe, controlled location or ideally remove the custom script execution feature entirely.
    * Display clear and prominent warnings to users about the **severe security risks** associated with enabling and using custom scripts. If the feature is kept, strongly emphasize loading scripts only from completely trusted sources and ideally disable it by default.
    * Conduct a thorough security code review, specifically focusing on all areas where user-provided file paths are processed and where `debugSession.evaluate` or similar dynamic code execution is used in the extension host context.
    * Re-evaluate the necessity of the custom script functionality. Given the critical security risk, consider removing it entirely to eliminate this code injection vulnerability.
