- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious “deno.path” Configuration

  - **Description:**
    The extension obtains the path to the Deno executable from the user’s or workspace’s configuration (the `"deno.path"` setting) without applying adequate sanitization or integrity checks. In the file `/code/client/src/util.ts`, the function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` simply returns the configured string—even if it is a relative path. Later in `getDenoCommandPath()`, if the provided path is not absolute the extension iterates over the workspace folders and resolves the path using `path.resolve(...)`. An attacker who controls the workspace (for example, via a maliciously crafted `.vscode/settings.json`) can set `"deno.path"` to a relative path (e.g. `"./malicious_executable"`) that points to an attacker‐supplied executable placed within the workspace. When the extension later spawns the Deno process (for example, to start the language server or execute tasks), it will execute the malicious binary instead of the genuine Deno CLI—thus allowing arbitrary command execution.

  - **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s machine. This may result in full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or further abuse of privileges.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - A basic file existence check (using an asynchronous `fs.stat` via the helper function `fileExists()`) is performed before returning a candidate executable. However, this check only confirms that a file is present and does not verify that it is the trusted Deno executable.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and sanitize the supplied `"deno.path"` configuration value to ensure it conforms to an expected format.
    - Enforce that the path must be absolute or, if relative, that it resolves only into known trusted directories (for example, system installation directories or a trusted installer’s location).
    - Optionally, perform a signature or hash check on the resolved executable before using it.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious workspace configuration (for example, by providing a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file) where `"deno.path"` is set to a relative path targeting a malicious executable.
    - The malicious executable is present at the specified relative path within the workspace.
    - The user opens the compromised workspace in VS Code and triggers a command that causes the extension to resolve and execute the Deno CLI.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/client/src/util.ts`, the helper function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` retrieves the configured path without sanitization:
      ```js
      function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
        const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
        if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
          return undefined;
        } else {
          return exePath;
        }
      }
      ```
    - In the same file, `getDenoCommandPath()` checks if the command is absolute; if not, it resolves it against each workspace folder:
      ```js
      export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
        const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
        const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
        if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
          return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
        } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
          for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
            const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
            if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
              return commandPath;
            }
          }
          return undefined;
        } else {
          return command;
        }
      }
      ```
    - Later (for example, during language server startup in `/code/client/src/commands.ts`), the resolved command is used to spawn a process—thus executing the malicious binary when the user triggers a Deno-related command.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Create a new workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
         ```json
         {
           "deno.path": "./malicious_executable"
         }
         ```
       - In the workspace root, place a dummy executable named `malicious_executable` (for example, a small script that creates a distinctive file or notification when run).
    2. **Execution:**
       - Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code.
       - Trigger an extension command that causes the Deno CLI to be resolved and executed (for example, use “Deno: Restart” or another command that calls `getDenoCommandPath()`).
    3. **Verification:**
       - Confirm that the dummy (malicious) executable was executed (for example, verify that the distinctive file was created).
       - This proves that the extension accepted the malicious relative path and executed an attacker-controlled binary.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Task Definitions

  - **Description:**
    The extension’s tasks provider retrieves task configurations from the language server without sanitizing the command or detail fields. In `/code/client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`, the function `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()` calls a request (using `client.sendRequest(taskReq)`) to obtain task definitions. For each returned task (referred to as `configTask`), the extension calls `buildDenoConfigTask` with parameters such as `configTask.name`, and, crucially, `configTask.command` (or `configTask.detail`) without additional validation. As a result, an attacker who supplies a malicious project (for example, via a carefully crafted `deno.json` file) can define a task whose command payload is attacker-controlled. When the user later triggers this task through the VS Code tasks interface, the extension executes the malicious command.

    **Step-by-step trigger scenario:**
    1. The attacker creates a repository that includes a malicious `deno.json` file. In that file, a task is defined with a command (or equivalent detail field) set to a malicious payload (for example, a path to an attacker-controlled script or an unexpected shell command).
    2. Upon opening this repository in VS Code, the extension invokes `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()`, which obtains the malicious task definition via `client.sendRequest(taskReq)`.
    3. The extension immediately uses the provided values to build a VS Code task using `buildDenoConfigTask`, without sanitizing the command string.
    4. When the user (perhaps inadvertently) selects and runs the task from the tasks sidebar, the extension calls `tasks.executeTask(task.task)` (as seen in the implementation of the `deno.client.runTask` command).
    5. The malicious command is executed, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the user’s system.

  - **Impact:**
    If executed, the attacker-controlled task can run arbitrary commands on the victim’s machine. This may lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or other forms of abuse.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No sanitization or validation is applied to task definitions retrieved from the language server.
    - The task parameters (particularly the command or detail field) are used directly as provided in the project configuration.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and sanitize the command (or detail) field of task definitions received from the language server or from project configuration files.
    - Enforce that only a whitelist of allowed commands (or command patterns) can be executed.
    - Optionally present a user warning or require confirmation before executing tasks defined externally by the project.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must supply a repository with a malicious `deno.json` (or equivalent configuration file) that defines a task containing an attacker-controlled command.
    - The user opens this repository in Visual Studio Code, causing the extension to load the malicious task into its tasks sidebar.
    - The user executes the malicious task (either inadvertently or through social engineering).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`, the method `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()` retrieves tasks via:
      ```js
      const configTasks = await client.sendRequest(taskReq);
      ```
    - For each received `configTask`, a task is built using:
      ```js
      const task = buildDenoConfigTask(
        workspaceFolder,
        process,
        configTask.name,
        configTask.command ?? configTask.detail,
        Uri.parse(configTask.sourceUri),
      );
      ```
      Here, the value of `configTask.command` (or `configTask.detail`) is used directly without sanitization.
    - The built task is then executed later when the user runs it via the command:
      ```js
      tasks.executeTask(task.task);
      ```
      As no validation is performed on the command payload, an attacker may inject an arbitrary command.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Craft a malicious `deno.json` file with a task definition similar to:
         ```json
         {
           "tasks": {
             "malicious": {
               "cmd": ["./malicious_script.sh"]
             }
           }
         }
         ```
         (Assume that the language server interprets the `"cmd"` field as corresponding to the `command` field in the task configuration.)
       - Include in the repository a dummy executable `malicious_script.sh` that, when run, creates a distinctive file or notification.
    2. **Execution:**
       - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
       - Wait for the extension to load and populate the tasks sidebar via `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()`.
       - Identify the task labeled “malicious” in the tasks sidebar and execute it (using the “Run Task” command).
    3. **Verification:**
       - Check that the dummy executable `malicious_script.sh` was executed (for example, by verifying that the distinctive file or notification has appeared).
       - This confirms that the extension executed an attacker-controlled command embedded in the task definition.

*Note:* Both vulnerabilities can be exploited when the user opens a repository whose project files (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json` or `deno.json`) have been crafted by an attacker. Users working with untrusted or community-sourced projects should be cautious, and additional validation of configuration values and task definitions is strongly recommended to mitigate these risks.
