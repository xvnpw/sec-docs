## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

After a thorough analysis of the code, focusing on potential vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself and triggerable by an external attacker, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that are not already mitigated, not denial of service, not caused by explicit insecure code patterns by developers, and not only missing documentation.

All potential risks identified during the analysis rely on the user configuring the extension with malicious settings (e.g., malicious `deno.path`, `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.importMap`, `deno.config`, `deno.envFile`, `deno.env`). These scenarios are explicitly excluded from the vulnerability list as they fall under "vulnerabilities that are caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES."

Therefore, based on the provided PROJECT FILES and the given constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
