### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via User-Provided Workspace Path in Test Scripts
- Description:
    1. The `test:e2e` script in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` and `scripts/test.sh` runs end-to-end tests for the VSCode extension.
    2. These scripts use `xvfb-run -a yarn run test:e2e` or `yarn run test:e2e` to execute the tests.
    3. The `yarn run test:e2e` command likely relies on the `package.json` or scripts defined within the project, which might include environment variables or paths.
    4. If a malicious user can influence the workspace path where these test scripts are executed (e.g., by contributing a malicious project to a public repository that a developer clones and runs tests on), they could potentially inject malicious commands into the test execution environment.
    5. This is because `yarn run` executes scripts in a shell environment, which can be vulnerable to command injection if user-controlled data is not properly sanitized.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine when they run tests for the VSCode extension in a workspace controlled by an attacker.
    - This could lead to exfiltration of sensitive data, installation of malware, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The project relies on standard GitHub Actions and yarn scripts for testing.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement secure test environment setup that isolates test execution from user-controlled workspace paths.
    - Avoid using `yarn run` or similar shell-executing commands directly with workspace-dependent paths, especially in CI/CD and testing scripts.
    - Consider using containerized testing environments to isolate test execution.
    - Implement input sanitization or validation if workspace paths are used in shell commands.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer clones a malicious project into their local workspace.
    - The developer runs the E2E tests for the Angular Language Service extension within this workspace (e.g., using `yarn test:e2e` or GitHub Actions workflows triggered by a pull request).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`.github/workflows/node.js.yml`**:
       ```yaml
       - run: xvfb-run -a yarn run test:e2e
         if: runner.os == 'Linux'
       - run: yarn run test:e2e
         if: runner.os != 'Linux'
       ```
    2. **`scripts/test.sh`**:
       ```bash
       yarn bazel test //...

       # E2E test that brings up full vscode
       # TODO: Disabled for now because it cannot be run on CircleCI
       # bazel test --test_output=streamed //integration/e2e:test
       ```
    3. These scripts directly use `yarn run test:e2e` which could be vulnerable if the workspace context is compromised.
    4. No sanitization or validation is observed on workspace paths before executing these commands.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious Angular project.
    2. In the malicious project's `package.json`, modify the `test:e2e` script to include a command injection payload. For example:
       ```json
       "scripts": {
         "test:e2e": "node -e 'require(\"child_process\").execSync(\"touch /tmp/pwned\");'",
         // ... other scripts
       }
       ```
    3. Host this malicious project on a public repository (e.g., GitHub).
    4. As a developer, clone the repository to your local machine.
    5. Open the Angular Language Service project in VSCode.
    6. Open the cloned malicious project as a workspace in VSCode (or ensure it is in the workspace).
    7. Run the E2E tests for the Angular Language Service by executing the 'E2E Test' workflow in GitHub Actions (if testing a PR) or by manually running `yarn run test:e2e` from the Angular Language Service project root.
    8. Observe if the command injection payload executes (e.g., check if the `/tmp/pwned` file is created).
    9. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Dependency Usage in Test Environment
- Description:
    1. The project uses `vsce` version `1.100.1` for packaging the VSCode extension.
    2. `vsce` is a command-line tool published by Microsoft for packaging VS Code extensions.
    3. While `vsce` itself is from a reputable source, the project's `pnpm-lock.yaml` file shows dependencies for `vsce` including potentially outdated or vulnerable transitive dependencies (e.g., dependencies with versions like `2.4.2`, `1.1.3` etc.).
    4. If vulnerabilities exist in these transitive dependencies of `vsce`, and if `vsce` is exploited or misused during the packaging process, it could potentially introduce security risks.
    5. Although the risk is lower as this is related to the development/packaging process and not runtime, vulnerabilities in build/packaging tools can still be a concern.
- Impact:
    - Potential compromise of the extension packaging process.
    - In a worst-case scenario, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code into the extension package if vulnerabilities in `vsce` or its dependencies are exploited.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified. The project relies on `pnpm` for dependency management, which helps with dependency resolution and lockfile integrity.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Regularly audit and update dependencies, including transitive dependencies, in `pnpm-lock.yaml` to address known vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using dependency scanning tools to automatically identify and report vulnerable dependencies.
    - Explore using more secure or actively maintained packaging tools if `vsce` and its dependency chain pose significant risks.
    - Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker discovers a vulnerability in `vsce` or one of its transitive dependencies used in the project's build/packaging process.
    - The attacker finds a way to exploit this vulnerability, potentially during the extension packaging stage.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**:
       - Review the dependency tree under `vsce@1.100.1` for outdated or known-vulnerable packages.
       - Example of potentially older dependencies: `chalk@2.4.2`, `ansi-styles@2.2.1`.
    2. **`package.json` and build scripts**:
       - Check how `vsce` is used in the build process (`scripts/build.sh`, `.github/workflows/*`).
       - Verify if there are any steps that might introduce vulnerabilities during packaging.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Use a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check) to scan the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file for known vulnerabilities in `vsce`'s dependency tree.
    2. If vulnerabilities are reported, investigate their severity and exploitability in the context of the Angular Language Service's packaging process.
    3. If a high or critical vulnerability is found and deemed exploitable, create a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential impact on the extension packaging.
    4. For example, if a vulnerability allows for code injection during packaging, attempt to inject a benign payload (like creating a file) into the packaged extension.
    5. If successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) in Test Environment (Low Probability, High Impact if Exploitable)
- Description:
    1. The `integration/e2e` tests bring up a full VSCode instance for testing.
    2. These tests may involve network requests for extension features or accessing resources within the test environment.
    3. Although not immediately apparent from the provided files, there's a possibility that the test environment or the VSCode instance launched for testing might make outbound network requests based on configurations or project setups controlled by the workspace.
    4. If a malicious user can control parts of the workspace or configurations used during E2E tests, they might be able to induce the test environment to make requests to internal or unintended external endpoints.
    5. This is a potential SSRF vulnerability if the test environment can be tricked into making requests to attacker-controlled servers or internal resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
- Impact:
    - (Low Probability, High Impact if Exploitable): If exploitable, SSRF could allow an attacker to probe internal networks, access sensitive resources that the test environment has access to, or potentially perform other actions depending on the capabilities of the test environment and the network configuration.
- Vulnerability Rank: High (potential impact if exploitable), but low probability based on current information. Requires further investigation.
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified in the provided project files. Standard VSCode test environment and network configurations are likely used.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Harden the test environment to prevent or restrict outbound network requests during E2E tests.
    - Implement network isolation for test environments.
    - Sanitize or validate any workspace-controlled configurations or inputs that could influence network requests made by the test environment.
    - Monitor outbound network traffic from test environments for anomalies.
- Preconditions:
    - A developer runs E2E tests for the Angular Language Service in a workspace that can influence network requests made by the test environment (VSCode instance launched for testing).
    - The test environment is susceptible to SSRF vulnerabilities due to how it handles network requests based on workspace configurations or project setups.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`integration/e2e/*` tests**:
       - Review the E2E test code to identify if any network requests are made by the test environment or the VSCode instance launched for testing.
       - Check if these requests are influenced by workspace configurations or project files.
    2. **VSCode test framework setup**:
       - Investigate how the VSCode test environment is set up and if it has any inherent SSRF risks.
       - Examine the network configurations and permissions of the test environment.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious Angular project that includes configurations or code designed to trigger a network request to an attacker-controlled server during E2E tests.
    2. Set up a network traffic monitoring tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) or a simple HTTP server to listen for outbound requests from the test environment.
    3. Run the E2E tests for the Angular Language Service with the malicious project loaded in the workspace.
    4. Observe if the test environment makes any unexpected outbound network requests to the attacker-controlled server or other unintended endpoints.
    5. If unintended outbound requests are observed, analyze the request details to assess the SSRF vulnerability and its potential impact.
