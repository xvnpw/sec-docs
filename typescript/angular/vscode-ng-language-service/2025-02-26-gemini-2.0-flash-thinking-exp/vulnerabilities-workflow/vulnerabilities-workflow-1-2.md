- **Vulnerability Name:** Inadvertent Re‑Enablement of the Rename Override TS Plugin
  **Description:**
  - The extension includes a TypeScript rename override plugin that is disabled by default.
  - However, if an attacker can force a user (for example, by tricking them into opening a compromised workspace) to modify workspace or user configuration files, they might cause this plugin to be re‑enabled.
  - Once activated, rename operations invoke the plugin’s logic (which delegates into Angular’s language service) without additional validation, potentially processing malicious rename requests.
  **Impact:**
  - An attacker may trigger arbitrary code execution within the VSCode process. This could lead to unsanctioned file modifications, data exfiltration, or even the installation of further malicious components.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The plugin is disabled by default in the extension’s configuration.
  - Documentation clearly states that the override is not active under normal usage.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no enforced runtime check that prevents an external attacker (via workspace or user configuration manipulation) from re‑enabling the plugin.
  - Additional input validation/sanitization in the rename request processing is absent.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to influence workspace or user settings (for example, by luring the user into opening a pre‑configured or compromised workspace).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the rename plugin source (for example, in the TS rename override module), the factory simply forwards rename operations into Angular’s language service without extra checks.
  - Since the plugin exists in the codebase and is only disabled by configuration, a manipulated configuration can load it and allow rename requests to flow un‑filtered.
  **Security Test Case:**
  - Run VSCode with the extension installed in a controlled environment.
  - Modify the workspace or user settings file (or open a workspace with malicious settings) so that the rename override plugin is force‑enabled.
  - Initiate a rename operation using an identifier that includes maliciously crafted characters.
  - Monitor the behavior (via logs or debugger) for evidence that the plugin improperly processes the input, indicating the potential for arbitrary command execution.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Untrusted TypeScript Package Loading via Workspace Dependencies
  **Description:**
  - The language service determines which TypeScript library to load by checking (in order) user‑configured overrides (such as the “typescript.tsdk” setting), then the bundled trusted version, and finally falling back to a TypeScript package found in the workspace’s “node_modules” directory.
  - If an attacker is able to introduce a malicious (though correctly named and versioned) TypeScript package into a workspace and if no trusted “tsdk” is set, the extension may load this untrusted package.
  - The malicious package code might then trigger arbitrary command or code execution within the extension process.
  **Impact:**
  - Exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VSCode extension. This could result in file modifications, data exfiltration, lateral movement, or installation of additional malicious software.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The extension ships with a bundled and trusted version of TypeScript that is used by default.
  - Users are advised (typically via documentation and settings recommendations) to explicitly set a trusted “typescript.tsdk” path, thereby avoiding reliance on a potentially compromised workspace package.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No runtime integrity verification (such as cryptographic signature or hash checks) is performed on workspace‑provided TypeScript packages.
  - There is no explicit user prompt or warning when falling back to a workspace version of TypeScript.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must control or supply a compromised TypeScript package into the workspace’s “node_modules” directory, and the user must not have over‑ridden the default behavior by specifying a trusted “typescript.tsdk”.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the module responsible for resolving TypeScript packages (located in the common resolver files and version provider), an ordered lookup is performed: first checking for a user‑provided “tsdk” option, then using the bundled version, and finally falling back to a package discovered in the workspace.
  - In the fallback code path, there are no integrity checks, so if an attacker supplies a malicious package that meets the expected naming and version requirements, it will be loaded.
  **Security Test Case:**
  - Create a controlled workspace and insert into its “node_modules” directory a malicious TypeScript package that matches the package name and version expectations.
  - Ensure that no trusted “typescript.tsdk” setting is provided.
  - Open the compromised workspace in VSCode with the extension enabled.
  - Trigger typical language service operations (such as auto‑completion or “go to definition”) and examine logs or behavior for abnormal actions or evidence of injected code execution.
