- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Dependency Override in Build Script
  - **Description:**
    When the build script is invoked with a special override flag (for example, “builds‑repo”), it rewrites the dependency for the Angular language service in the root package file (package.json) to point to a hardcoded external GitHub URL. An attacker who is able to influence the build parameters (for example, via a manipulated pull request or CI/CD configuration) could force the build to use code fetched from an external location that is not verified cryptographically.
    *Triggering scenario step‑by‑step:*
    1. An attacker submits a pull request (or influences the CI/CD parameters) causing the build script to be executed with the override flag.
    2. The build logic then rewrites the “@angular/language-service” dependency in package.json to use an external repository URL.
    3. Because no signature or hash verification is performed on the fetched code, the resulting build artifact (for example, the VSCode extension) ends up packaging unverified—and possibly malicious—code.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker controlling the external dependency’s source could inject malicious code into developer tooling or the built artifact (such as a VSCode extension), creating a severe supply‑chain compromise and potentially enabling remote code execution.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The build script validates that a required, exact override flag is used only under expected circumstances.
    • In normal operation, dependency versions are pinned in package.json so that integrity is enforced.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • There is no cryptographic signature or hash verification once the external dependency is fetched.
    • Further CI/CD guardrails (such as manual review or sandboxing of override builds) are not in place.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • An attacker must be able to influence the build process (via malicious pull requests or compromise of CI/CD parameters).
    • The build script must be invoked using the override flag.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • In the build module (build.ts), the script accepts command‑line parameters and, when the override flag is detected, opens package.json and replaces the “@angular/language-service” dependency URL with a hardcoded external URL.
    • No hash or digital signature is performed after downloading the external code.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled CI/CD/test environment, trigger the build script with the override flag (for example, “builds‑repo”).
    2. Verify that package.json is rewritten so that the dependency URL now points to the external repository.
    3. Attempt to manipulate parameters or CI/CD configuration to ensure that no post‑fetch integrity checks (like hashing or signature verification) are performed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Exposure of Secrets via Pull Request Target Workflow
  - **Description:**
    The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run on the “pull_request_target” event—which runs in the context of the target branch and inherits repository secrets. If an attacker (for example, via a carefully crafted fork pull request) tweaks the workflow or its inputs, secret values (such as deployment tokens or private keys) may be exposed in logs or artifacts.
    *Triggering scenario step‑by‑step:*
    1. An attacker from a fork submits a pull request, triggering a workflow run on “pull_request_target.”
    2. The attacker carefully adjusts non‐critical fields or payloads so that some steps inadvertently log or expose secret data.
    3. The attacker then retrieves the logs or artifacts to extract the secrets.
  - **Impact:**
    Exposed repository or deployment secrets could be used to compromise the CI/CD pipeline and downstream production systems.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • Many GitHub actions in the workflow are pinned to fixed commit hashes to reduce risk from tampering.
    • GitHub’s built‑in restrictions for workflows (especially on pull_request_target events) provide a baseline level of secret isolation.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Additional isolation measures (such as explicit environment variable scrubbing or manual approval steps) are not implemented beyond GitHub defaults.
    • The workflow lacks explicit steps to prevent secret values from being logged or exported.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • An attacker must be able to submit a pull request from a fork.
    • The workflow must be triggered using the “pull_request_target” event.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • In the workflow file (for example, .github/workflows/dev‑infra.yml), the “pull_request_target” event is used.
    • Several workflow steps reference environment variables (for example, ANGULAR_ROBOT_PRIVATE_KEY) without additional scrubbing to ensure secrets are not leaked.
    • Reliance on GitHub’s defaults means that if an attacker can alter even non‑critical workflow fields, some secrets may end up in logs.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test repository replicating the workflow, submit a pull request from a fork.
    2. Monitor the workflow run and its logs/artifacts to verify that no secret values are printed or exported.
    3. Simulate a workflow step modification and confirm that even with such changes the secrets remain protected.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Code Injection via Malicious Angular Templates in the Language Service Server
  - **Description:**
    The Angular language service (which powers features like diagnostics and IntelliSense in the VSCode extension) parses Angular templates embedded within components. If the template parser does not strictly validate or sandbox its input, an attacker who commits a specially crafted Angular template to a public repository could force the language service into an unexpected code path or—even in extreme cases—trigger execution of unexpected logic.
    *Triggering scenario step‑by‑step:*
    1. An attacker commits (or causes to be committed) a malicious Angular template containing deeply nested or unusual binding expressions into a public repository.
    2. When a developer opens the project (or when the language service processes the template as part of diagnostics), the malicious template is parsed.
    3. If the parser does not provide proper sandboxing or input validation, the malicious template may trigger an unexpected code path that facilitates arbitrary code execution within the Node.js process running the Angular language service.
  - **Impact:**
    Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer’s workstation. In the context of a VSCode extension, this may allow for installation of persistent backdoors, data exfiltration, or broader compromise of the development environment.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The Angular compiler APIs (which form the foundation of the language service) perform a degree of sanitization on template inputs.
    • Documentation recommends that developers enable strict template compiler options (e.g. `"strictTemplates": true`), which help flag anomalous template constructs early.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • There is no additional sandboxing or isolation layered on the template parser beyond what Angular provides.
    • Comprehensive whitelisting or runtime input validation of template constructs is not enforced before evaluation.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • A malicious actor must be able to supply a specially crafted Angular template to a public repository (or inject such a file via a dependency or pull request).
    • A developer must then open that project so the Angular language service processes the malicious template.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • The language service server (spread across multiple modules in the “client” and “server” directories) uses Angular’s compiler APIs to parse templates.
    • Files in the “syntaxes” folder (which define grammar and expression parsing) and the integration code in “embedded_support.ts” do not add extra sandboxing—meaning that if a template contains atypical or malicious expressions, the standard parsing logic may follow an unintended evaluation route.
    • This same parsing behavior is what underpins the possible injection vector.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create or modify an Angular component (preferably in a controlled test repository) to include a maliciously crafted template (for example, one with deeply nested or abnormally formatted binding expressions).
    2. Open the project in a supported editor (via the Angular language service extension) so that the template is processed.
    3. Observe whether the language service exhibits any crashes, unexpected behavior, or evidence that an unintended parsing path was reached (for example, by instrumenting logging in the template parser).
