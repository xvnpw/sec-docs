Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Angular, focusing on high and critical severity levels:

*   **Template Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into Angular templates that are then executed in the user's browser.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular's template engine renders dynamic content. If user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS. Specifically, bypassing Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms or using `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods carelessly increases this risk.
    *   **Example:** Displaying a user's comment directly in a template using `{{comment.text}}` where `comment.text` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rely on Angular's built-in sanitization by default. Avoid using `bypassSecurityTrust...` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Sanitize user input on the server-side as well. Use Angular's `DomSanitizer` service for manual sanitization when needed. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).

*   **Client-Side Routing Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate client-side routes to access unauthorized parts of the application or bypass intended navigation flows.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular's client-side routing mechanism defines how users navigate within the application. If route guards or logic within components are not implemented correctly, attackers can potentially bypass authentication or authorization checks that are solely client-side.
    *   **Example:** A route guard checks if `user.isAuthenticated` is true. An attacker might manipulate the application state or local storage to set this value to `true` and access a protected route.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization on the server-side. Do not rely solely on client-side route guards for security. Ensure route guards are correctly implemented and tested. Avoid storing sensitive authorization information directly in the client-side application state.

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (npm Packages)**
    *   **Description:** The Angular application uses third-party libraries (npm packages) that contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular applications heavily rely on npm packages for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited within the Angular application's context.
    *   **Example:** An older version of a charting library used in the Angular application has a known XSS vulnerability that can be triggered through the application's UI.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly audit and update npm dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Use dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline. Stay informed about security advisories for used libraries.
