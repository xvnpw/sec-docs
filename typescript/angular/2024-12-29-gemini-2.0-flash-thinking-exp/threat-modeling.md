Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats directly involving the Angular framework:

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection
    *   **Description:**
        *   Threat: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing unsanitized input that is then rendered within an Angular template.
        *   How: This can occur when user-provided data is directly bound to the template without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker's script to be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the application, performing actions on behalf of the user, and potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Template` (specifically, the data binding mechanism within templates).
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms.
        *   Employ `SafeValue` types when necessary for rendering potentially unsafe content after careful validation.
        *   Avoid using `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Routing Vulnerability - Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:**
        *   Threat: An attacker manipulates the client-side routing mechanism to access parts of the application they are not authorized to view or interact with.
        *   How: This can happen if route guards are not implemented correctly or if the application relies solely on client-side checks for authorization without server-side verification. Attackers might directly manipulate the browser's URL or history.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized modification of data, and potential circumvention of application logic.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Router` (specifically, route guards and route configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust route guards to protect sensitive routes.
        *   Always perform server-side authorization checks in addition to client-side checks.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side logic for security decisions.

*   **Threat:** State Management Manipulation
    *   **Description:**
        *   Threat: An attacker manipulates the client-side application state, potentially leading to unintended behavior or access to sensitive information.
        *   How: This can occur if state management logic is flawed or if there are vulnerabilities in the state management library itself (e.g., NgRx, Akita). Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities to directly modify the state.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Altering application data, triggering unintended actions, potentially leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   State Management Libraries (e.g., NgRx `Store`, Akita `Store`).
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully select and vet state management libraries.
        *   Follow best practices for state management and immutability.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks before allowing state changes.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive data directly in the client-side state if not necessary.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Use of `bypassSecurityTrust...` Methods
    *   **Description:**
        *   Threat: Developers use Angular's `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods (e.g., `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustStyle`) without proper validation, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   How: These methods are intended to allow developers to explicitly mark content as safe, but if used incorrectly with untrusted data, they can bypass Angular's built-in sanitization and introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `DomSanitizer` (the service providing these methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods with extreme caution and only after thorough validation and sanitization of the underlying data.
        *   Document the reasons for using these methods and the validation steps taken.
        *   Prefer Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms whenever possible.
