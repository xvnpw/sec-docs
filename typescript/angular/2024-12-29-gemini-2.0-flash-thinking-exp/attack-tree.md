**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting weaknesses in how Angular renders dynamic content, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that is executed in the user's browser. This often involves manipulating data that is bound to the template.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts into the Angular templates. When Angular renders these templates, the injected scripts are executed in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript in User-Controlled Data:**
    *   Attack Vector:  Leveraging user-provided data that is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered in the Angular template. If an attacker can control this data, they can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

*   **Exploit Insecure Data Binding (e.g., `[innerHTML]`, bypassing sanitization) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Using Angular's `[innerHTML]` binding or finding ways to bypass Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms. `[innerHTML]` directly renders HTML, bypassing sanitization, and vulnerabilities in the sanitization logic can allow malicious code to slip through.

*   **Exploit Third-Party Component Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector:  Exploiting known security vulnerabilities, particularly XSS flaws, in third-party Angular components or libraries used in the application. Attackers can leverage public exploits or discover new vulnerabilities to inject malicious code.

*   **Exploit Angular-Specific Security Features Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Targeting weaknesses or misconfigurations in Angular's built-in security features, such as the sanitization service or Content Security Policy (CSP) integration.

*   **Bypass Angular's Built-in Sanitization:**
    *   Attack Vector: Discovering edge cases or vulnerabilities in Angular's sanitization logic that allow malicious code to bypass the sanitization process and be rendered as executable code.

*   **Manipulate Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting a poorly configured or overly permissive Content Security Policy. If the CSP allows scripts from untrusted sources or uses `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`, attackers can inject and execute malicious scripts despite other security measures.

*   **Client-Side Redirect Manipulation:**
    *   Attack Vector: Manipulating route parameters or application state to redirect users to malicious external websites. This can be used for phishing attacks or to trick users into visiting compromised sites.

*   **Bypass Client-Side Validation:**
    *   Attack Vector:  Circumventing client-side validation checks, which are implemented in Angular, to submit invalid or malicious data to the server. This is often done by manipulating the HTML or using browser developer tools.

*   **Form Injection Attacks:**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into form fields. If this injected code is not properly sanitized when the form data is displayed or processed, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Utilizing compromised or vulnerable Angular packages or their dependencies. Attackers can inject malicious code into popular packages, which is then included in applications that use those packages, leading to widespread compromise.
