# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for angular/angular

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Template Compilation Control](./mitigation_strategies/strict_template_compilation_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Dynamic Template Compilation with User Input.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Angular code** using `TemplateRef` or `ViewContainerRef` for dynamic template compilation.
    2.  **Analyze data sources:** Check if user input (from URLs, forms, APIs reflecting user input) is used in these dynamic templates.
    3.  **Refactor using Angular features:** Replace dynamic template strings with Angular's component composition and data binding.
        *   Create Angular components for different content variations.
        *   Use Angular directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngSwitch`, or dynamic component loading (with trusted Angular components) based on application state, not raw user input strings.
    4.  **Angular code review:** Review Angular components and services to prevent new dynamic template compilation with user-controlled data.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) - High Severity:** Attackers inject malicious code into Angular templates, leading to code execution in the user's browser, exploiting Angular's template engine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSTI - High Reduction:** Eliminates the primary Angular-specific attack vector for CSTI by preventing user input from being interpreted as Angular template code.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally implemented in core Angular components and services where dynamic content is rendered based on application logic and backend API data (assuming APIs don't directly reflect user input in template-sensitive fields).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing in Angular components handling user-generated content:
        *   Angular components for rich text editors or comment sections.
        *   Angular admin panel components allowing UI customization based on user configurations.
        *   Angular components displaying data from external sources without careful sanitization and structural control within Angular templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Angular Security Contexts](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_angular_security_contexts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Angular's Built-in Security Contexts.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Angular Security Contexts:** Learn about Angular's security contexts (`HTML`, `STYLE`, `SCRIPT`, `URL`, `RESOURCE_URL`, `MEDIA_URL`) and how Angular sanitizes based on these contexts.
    2.  **Inspect Angular data bindings:** Review data bindings in Angular templates (`{{ ... }}`, `[property]`, `bind-property`).
    3.  **Correct Angular property binding:** Ensure data is bound to DOM properties that trigger Angular's sanitization. For example:
        *   Use Angular's `[innerHTML]` for HTML content (after sanitization if needed using Angular's `DomSanitizer`).
        *   Use Angular's `[src]` for image URLs.
        *   Use Angular's `[style.property]` for inline styles.
    4.  **Avoid string concatenation in Angular templates:** Do not construct URLs or HTML strings by concatenating user input directly within Angular templates. Use Angular property binding and rely on Angular's sanitization.
    5.  **Angular input testing:** Test Angular components with various user inputs, including malicious strings, to verify Angular's sanitization is working as expected within the Angular framework.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious scripts through DOM manipulation within Angular applications by leveraging Angular's built-in sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - High Reduction:** Significantly reduces XSS risk by utilizing Angular's default security mechanisms and sanitization within Angular templates.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented by default in Angular applications due to Angular's automatic sanitization in templates. Developers implicitly benefit by using standard Angular data binding.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Can be undermined in Angular components if developers:
        *   Use Angular's `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods without proper justification and sanitization within Angular components.
        *   Incorrectly bind data in Angular templates to DOM properties that bypass Angular sanitization (less common in standard Angular practices).
        *   Manually manipulate the DOM outside of Angular's rendering pipeline, bypassing Angular's security contexts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Sanitization with Angular DomSanitizer](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_sanitization_with_angular_domsanitizer.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User Input When Necessary (Use with Caution) using Angular's `DomSanitizer`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Angular scenarios** where displaying user-provided HTML is necessary within Angular components.
    2.  **Use Angular's `DomSanitizer` service:** Inject Angular's `DomSanitizer` into your Angular component or service.
    3.  **Sanitize user input with Angular's `DomSanitizer`:** Before rendering user-provided HTML in Angular templates, use `DomSanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, userInput)`.
    4.  **Bind sanitized content in Angular templates:** Bind the sanitized output to Angular's `[innerHTML]` property.
    5.  **Choose correct Angular `SecurityContext`:** Select the appropriate Angular `SecurityContext` based on content type (e.g., `SecurityContext.URL` for URLs, `SecurityContext.STYLE` for styles within Angular).
    6.  **Document Angular sanitization logic:** Document why Angular sanitization is needed, the chosen `SecurityContext`, and limitations of Angular's sanitization process in your Angular code.
    7.  **Regularly review Angular sanitization:** Periodically review Angular sanitization logic to ensure effectiveness and alignment with security best practices within the Angular application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Medium Severity (Reduced by Angular Sanitization):** Mitigates XSS by removing malicious code from user-provided HTML using Angular's `DomSanitizer`, but Angular sanitization is not foolproof.
    *   **Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) - Low Severity (Indirectly):** Angular sanitization can help prevent some CSTI forms if user input is inadvertently interpreted as template code within HTML rendered by Angular.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Medium Reduction:** Reduces XSS risk within Angular applications, but relies on Angular's `DomSanitizer` effectiveness and correct usage. Improper use can still leave Angular components vulnerable.
    *   **CSTI - Low Reduction:** Provides limited indirect protection against certain CSTI scenarios within Angular applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially implemented in Angular components displaying user-generated content:
        *   Angular components for forums or comment sections.
        *   Angular CMS components where administrators input HTML.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   May be missing in Angular components displaying user-provided HTML without Angular sanitization, or with incorrect/insufficient Angular sanitization.
    *   Areas where developers might use Angular's `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` without proper Angular sanitization as a shortcut in Angular components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Angular `bypassSecurityTrust...` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_angular__bypasssecuritytrust_____usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Use of Angular's `bypassSecurityTrust...` Methods.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Angular code for `bypassSecurityTrust...`:** Search your Angular codebase for all instances of `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustStyle`, `bypassSecurityTrustScript`, `bypassSecurityTrustUrl`, and `bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl`.
    2.  **Justify each Angular usage:** For each instance in Angular code, critically evaluate why bypassing Angular's security is necessary.
    3.  **Explore Angular alternatives:** Investigate Angular-specific alternatives to avoid bypassing security:
        *   Using Angular's built-in sanitization and security contexts.
        *   Refactoring Angular components to handle data safely within Angular's framework.
    4.  **Implement robust sanitization (if bypassing is unavoidable in Angular):** If bypassing Angular security is truly necessary, ensure thorough and robust sanitization *before* using `bypassSecurityTrust...` in Angular code. Document the Angular sanitization logic clearly.
    5.  **Restrict Angular usage to trusted sources:** Limit `bypassSecurityTrust...` usage in Angular components to data from highly trusted sources only. Never use it directly on user-provided input without rigorous validation and Angular sanitization.
    6.  **Regularly review Angular usage:** Periodically review `bypassSecurityTrust...` usage in Angular code to ensure it remains justified and secure within the Angular application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Directly reduces XSS risk in Angular applications by minimizing explicit bypasses of Angular's security, which are potential vulnerability entry points within Angular components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - High Reduction:** Significantly reduces XSS risk in Angular applications by limiting the attack surface created by bypassing Angular's security features within Angular components.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Ideally, this is an Angular development practice enforced through Angular code reviews and security awareness training for Angular developers. Developers should be discouraged from using Angular's `bypassSecurityTrust...` without strong justification.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing if Angular developers are unaware of the security implications of Angular's `bypassSecurityTrust...` and use it liberally without proper Angular sanitization or justification in Angular components.
    *   Missing if Angular code reviews do not specifically focus on identifying and scrutinizing the usage of these Angular methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Angular Routing Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_angular_routing_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Angular Routing Configuration.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Angular Route Guards:** Use Angular route guards (`CanActivate`, `CanLoad`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`) within Angular routing modules to control route access based on authentication and authorization within the Angular application.
    2.  **Angular Authentication Guards:** Implement Angular `CanActivate` guards to ensure only authenticated users can access specific Angular routes or features.
    3.  **Angular Authorization Guards:** Implement Angular `CanActivate` guards to enforce role-based or permission-based access control, allowing only authorized users to access certain Angular routes.
    4.  **Angular Lazy Loading Guards (`CanLoad`):** Use Angular `CanLoad` guards to prevent lazy-loaded Angular modules from loading if the user lacks permissions, improving initial load time and security in Angular applications.
    5.  **Avoid Sensitive Data in Angular Route Parameters:** Minimize exposing sensitive information directly in Angular route parameters or URLs. Consider alternative methods like session storage or server-side storage for sensitive data within the Angular application.
    6.  **Test Angular Route Guards:** Thoroughly test Angular route guards to ensure they correctly enforce access control and prevent unauthorized access to Angular routes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access - High Severity:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive parts of the Angular application or features they are not permitted to use, leveraging Angular's routing security features.
    *   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Reduces information disclosure risk by preventing unauthorized access to Angular routes or features that might reveal sensitive information within the Angular application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access - High Reduction:** Effectively enforces access control within the Angular application using Angular's routing guards, preventing unauthorized route access.
    *   **Information Disclosure - Medium Reduction:** Reduces information disclosure risk by controlling access to sensitive areas within the Angular application's routing structure.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely implemented in Angular applications requiring user authentication and authorization. Angular route guards are a standard Angular feature for implementing access control within Angular applications.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing if Angular route guards are not used at all, or not comprehensively across all Angular routes requiring access control.
    *   Missing if Angular route guards are incorrectly configured or tested, leading to bypasses or vulnerabilities in Angular routing security.
    *   Missing if sensitive data is exposed in Angular route parameters without proper security consideration within the Angular application's routing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Angular Form Validation and Security](./mitigation_strategies/angular_form_validation_and_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Angular Form Validation and Security.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Angular Client-Side Validation:** Use Angular's form validation features (reactive forms or template-driven forms) to provide immediate feedback to users and improve user experience within Angular forms. Validate data types, formats, required fields, and basic constraints using Angular validators on the client-side.
    2.  **Use Angular Form Features Securely:** Utilize Angular's form features securely:
        *   Use Angular `Validators` for client-side validation within Angular forms.
        *   Handle Angular form submission securely using Angular's `HttpClient` and appropriate HTTP methods (POST, PUT).
        *   Display server-side validation errors to the user in a user-friendly way within the Angular application.
    3.  **Test Angular Form Security:** Thoroughly test Angular forms with various inputs, including invalid, malicious, and boundary-case data, to ensure Angular client-side validation is working correctly and securely in conjunction with server-side validation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Integrity Issues - Medium Severity:** Angular client-side validation contributes to maintaining data integrity by ensuring data conforms to expected formats and constraints within Angular forms before submission.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Integrity Issues - Medium Reduction:** Angular form validation improves data quality and reduces data integrity problems within the Angular application.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Angular client-side validation is often implemented in Angular applications for user experience within Angular forms.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing if Angular client-side validation is not implemented, leading to a poor user experience and potentially allowing invalid data to be submitted to the server from Angular forms.
