## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Client-Side Data and State -> Exploit Insecure Data Binding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_-_manipulate_client-side_data_and_state_-_explo_f8a8f091.md)

*   Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities:
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This represents the initial phase where an attacker targets weaknesses in the client-side Angular application.

*   Manipulate Client-Side Data and State:
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: The attacker aims to alter the application's data or state to their advantage. This often involves exploiting how Angular manages and displays data.

*   Exploit Insecure Data Binding (Critical Node):
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This critical node focuses on the vulnerability where user-controlled data is directly bound to the template without proper sanitization.

*   Action: Inject malicious data into Angular components that is not properly sanitized before being displayed or used in logic, potentially leading to XSS. (Critical Node):
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This is the actionable step where the attacker injects malicious scripts or HTML, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing sensitive information, hijacking user sessions, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Client-Side Template Vulnerabilities -> Angular Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_client-side_template_vulnerabilities__1cb49aff.md)

*   Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities:
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description:  As described in High-Risk Path 1, this is the initial stage of targeting client-side weaknesses.

*   Exploit Client-Side Template Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This critical node represents vulnerabilities within how Angular templates are processed, particularly when dynamic content is involved.

*   Angular Template Injection (Critical Node):
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This critical node focuses on the vulnerability where attackers can inject malicious Angular expressions or HTML directly into the template. This often occurs when template content is dynamically generated based on user input without proper sanitization.

*   Action: Inject malicious Angular expressions or HTML into template bindings that are not properly sanitized, leading to code execution or data leakage. (Critical Node):
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Description: This is the actionable step where the attacker injects malicious code directly into the Angular template. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the Angular application's context, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage, manipulation of the UI, or even control over the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Compromise Angular Application](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_compromise_angular_application.md)

*   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: Very High
    *   Effort: High
    *   Skill Level: High
    *   Detection Difficulty: High
    *   Description: This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate successful compromise of the application.
