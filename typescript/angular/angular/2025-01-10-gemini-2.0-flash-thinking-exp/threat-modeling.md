# Threat Model Analysis for angular/angular

## Threat: [Template Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application's data, which is then rendered within an Angular template without proper sanitization. The browser executes this script in the user's context when the template is rendered. This can be achieved by manipulating URL parameters, form inputs, or data received from backend services.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, defacing the application, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:** `Template`, `Interpolation`, `Property Binding` (core Angular features for rendering data in the view)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Angular's built-in sanitization features provided by the `DomSanitizer`.
    *   Avoid using `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Implement contextual output encoding.
    *   Ensure data received from untrusted sources is properly sanitized on the server-side as well.

## Threat: [Client-Side Route Guard Bypass](./threats/client-side_route_guard_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses Angular route guards designed to protect specific application routes. This could involve manipulating browser history, directly accessing routes through the browser's address bar, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the guard's logic.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to protected parts of the application, potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** `Router`, `Route Guards` (`CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `CanLoad`, `Resolve`) (core Angular modules for navigation and access control)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust and well-tested route guard logic.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side route guards for security. Implement server-side authorization checks as the primary security mechanism.
    *   Ensure route guard logic cannot be easily circumvented by manipulating client-side state or browser history.

## Threat: [Exploiting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** When using Angular Universal for SSR, vulnerabilities in the server-side rendering process can be exploited. This might involve injecting malicious code that gets executed during the server-side rendering phase, potentially leading to information disclosure or server-side attacks.
*   **Impact:**  Information leakage from the server, denial of service on the rendering server, or potential remote code execution on the server in severe cases.
*   **Affected Component:** `Angular Universal`, `Platform Server` (Angular's platform for server-side rendering)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices for Node.js applications.
    *   Sanitize data used during the server-side rendering process.
    *   Keep Node.js and its dependencies up to date.
    *   Implement proper error handling and logging on the server-side.

## Threat: [Bypassing DOMSanitizer with `bypassSecurityTrust...` Methods](./threats/bypassing_domsanitizer_with__bypasssecuritytrust_____methods.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might intentionally bypass Angular's built-in `DomSanitizer` using methods like `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustStyle`, etc. If used incorrectly or with untrusted data, this can directly introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, with the same potential impacts as standard XSS.
*   **Affected Component:** `DomSanitizer` (Angular's built-in service for preventing XSS)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.
    *   If these methods are unavoidable, ensure the data being passed is strictly controlled and comes from a trusted source.
    *   Document the reasons for using these methods and the security considerations involved.

## Threat: [Compromised Angular CLI or Build Process Leading to Supply Chain Attacks](./threats/compromised_angular_cli_or_build_process_leading_to_supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** If the developer's environment or the build pipeline is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the Angular application during the build process. This could involve tampering with Angular CLI configuration, build scripts, or dependencies.
*   **Impact:**  Introduction of malware or malicious functionality directly into the application, affecting all users.
*   **Affected Component:** `Angular CLI` (Angular's command-line interface), `Build Process` (involving Angular's build tools and configurations)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure developer environments and build pipelines.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Implement integrity checks for dependencies (e.g., using lock files).
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for build processes and access controls.

## Threat: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Misconfiguration Leading to XSS](./threats/content_security_policy__csp__misconfiguration_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** An improperly configured or overly permissive CSP can fail to adequately protect against XSS attacks. For example, allowing `unsafe-inline` for scripts or styles can negate many of the benefits of CSP.
*   **Impact:** Increased risk of successful XSS attacks, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts.
*   **Affected Component:** While not an Angular component itself, the application's overall configuration and potentially server-side headers, impacting the security context in which Angular runs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a strict and well-defined CSP.
    *   Avoid using `unsafe-inline` for scripts and styles. Use nonces or hashes for inline resources.
    *   Regularly review and update the CSP as the application evolves.
    *   Test the CSP thoroughly to ensure it is effective and doesn't block legitimate resources.
