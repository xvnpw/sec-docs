# Attack Surface Analysis for angular/angular

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Binding](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_binding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by the victim's browser.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular's dynamic template binding can render user-controlled data directly into the DOM. If this data is not properly sanitized, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** An application displays a user's comment. If the comment contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and is directly bound to the template using `{{ comment }}`, the script will execute.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize Angular's Built-in Sanitization:** Angular automatically sanitizes values bound to the DOM. Ensure developers are not bypassing this sanitization unnecessarily using methods like `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`.
        *   **Sanitize User Input on the Server-Side:**  Perform sanitization on the backend before storing data.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation:** Minimize direct manipulation of the DOM using `nativeElement` or similar methods, as this can bypass Angular's sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Security Contexts](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_security_contexts.md)

*   **Description:** Developers intentionally bypass Angular's built-in sanitization using `DomSanitizer` methods.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular provides the `DomSanitizer` service with methods like `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustScript`, etc., to explicitly mark values as safe. Incorrect use on untrusted data creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A developer fetches HTML content from an external source and uses `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` to render it without proper validation, unknowingly including malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** XSS leading to account takeover, redirection, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `bypassSecurityTrust...` on Untrusted Data:** Only use these methods on data that is absolutely guaranteed to be safe and under your control.
        *   **Thoroughly Validate and Sanitize External Data:** Treat data from external sources as potentially malicious and sanitize it before using `bypassSecurityTrust...`.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify instances of `bypassSecurityTrust...` and ensure their proper usage.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the application's routing logic can be exploited to bypass authorization or access unintended parts of the application.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular's Router manages navigation within the application. Misconfigured or poorly implemented route guards can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A route guard intended to restrict access to admin pages has a logical flaw, allowing unauthorized users to navigate to `/admin` by manipulating the URL or browser history.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Robust Route Guards:** Ensure route guards (`CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, etc.) have correct logic and perform thorough authorization checks.
        *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Always perform authorization checks on the server-side for critical operations, even if client-side guards are in place.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review routing configurations and guard implementations for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities specific to the server-side environment when using Angular Universal for SSR.
    *   **How Angular Contributes:** Angular Universal enables rendering Angular applications on the server using Node.js. This introduces server-side attack vectors.
    *   **Example:**  A vulnerability in the Node.js version or server-side dependencies used for SSR allows for remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure the Node.js Server:** Follow Node.js security best practices, including keeping Node.js and server-side dependencies updated.
        *   **Sanitize Data Rendered Server-Side:**  Ensure proper sanitization of data rendered on the server to prevent server-side template injection.
        *   **Secure Server Configuration:** Implement secure server configurations and restrict access.
