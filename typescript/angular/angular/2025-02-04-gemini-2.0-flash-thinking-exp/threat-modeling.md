# Threat Model Analysis for angular/angular

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application through user-controlled data that is rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization. The attacker might manipulate input fields, URL parameters, or other client-side data sources. When the Angular application processes and renders this data into the DOM, the malicious script executes in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting the user, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover
    *   Data theft (credentials, personal information)
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Website defacement
    *   Session hijacking
*   **Affected Angular Component:**
    *   Templates (`*.component.html` files)
    *   Data binding mechanisms (e.g., `{{ }}`)
    *   `DomSanitizer` service (if misused or bypassed)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Default Sanitization:** Rely on Angular's built-in sanitization for template expressions by default.
    *   **`DomSanitizer` Usage:** Use `DomSanitizer` with extreme caution and only when necessary to bypass sanitization for trusted content. Thoroughly validate and sanitize data before bypassing sanitization.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user inputs on both client-side and server-side.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed and mitigate the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to inject malicious Angular template syntax or code into the application by manipulating user-controlled data that is used to dynamically construct or modify Angular templates or components. While Angular is designed to prevent direct template injection, vulnerabilities can arise in less common scenarios involving dynamic component loading or string manipulation used to build templates.  Successful injection could lead to code execution or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (in rare, misconfigured scenarios)
    *   Information Disclosure (sensitive data leakage)
    *   Application Denial of Service
*   **Affected Angular Component:**
    *   Dynamic Component Loading (`ComponentFactoryResolver`, `ViewContainerRef`)
    *   String interpolation in non-standard scenarios (e.g., dynamically building templates from strings)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Template Construction:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically construct templates based on user input.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic component loading is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the component type and inputs server-side or against a secure whitelist.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Avoid using string manipulation to build templates. Prefer Angular's component composition and data binding mechanisms.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate potential template injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Client-Side Routing Vulnerabilities](./threats/client-side_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Angular's client-side routing mechanism to gain unauthorized access to application sections or perform unintended actions. This can include:
    *   **Open Redirects:**  Improperly validated redirect URLs in route handling can be manipulated to redirect users to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    *   **Authorization Bypass:**  Misconfigured route guards or insufficient authorization checks can allow unauthorized users to access protected routes and functionalities.
    *   **Route Parameter Injection:**  Improperly sanitized route parameters can be used to inject malicious code or manipulate application logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to application features
    *   Data breach
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Malware distribution (via open redirects)
*   **Affected Angular Component:**
    *   `RouterModule` (routing module)
    *   Route Guards (`CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`)
    *   Route configuration (`app-routing.module.ts`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Route Guards:** Implement comprehensive route guards to enforce authorization and authentication for protected routes.
    *   **Input Validation for Route Parameters:** Validate and sanitize route parameters and query parameters to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
    *   **Prevent Open Redirects:** Carefully control redirect destinations and validate them against a whitelist if necessary. Avoid using user-controlled data directly in redirect URLs.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:**  Test routing configurations and route guards to ensure proper authorization and prevent bypasses.

## Threat: [Insecure Route Configurations](./threats/insecure_route_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers unintentionally expose sensitive data or functionality through misconfigurations in Angular route definitions. This can include:
    *   **Exposing Debugging Routes:**  Leaving development-specific routes or debugging tools accessible in production builds.
    *   **Unprotected Administrative Interfaces:**  Failing to properly secure administrative routes, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Routes:**  Exposing sensitive data through route parameters or in the response of unprotected routes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure (sensitive data leakage)
    *   Unauthorized access to administrative functions
    *   Application compromise
*   **Affected Angular Component:**
    *   Route configuration (`app-routing.module.ts`)
    *   Modules and components associated with routes
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review Route Configurations:** Carefully review route configurations, especially before deploying to production.
    *   **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Use environment variables and build configurations to conditionally include or exclude routes based on the environment (development, staging, production).
    *   **Authorization for All Routes:** Implement proper authorization checks on all routes, especially those handling sensitive data or actions.
    *   **Remove Debugging Routes in Production:** Ensure that development-specific routes and debugging tools are removed or disabled in production builds.

## Threat: [Server-Side XSS in SSR (If Applicable)](./threats/server-side_xss_in_ssr__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If using Angular Universal for Server-Side Rendering (SSR), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled data that is rendered server-side and included in the initial HTML response. This occurs when user input is not properly sanitized during the SSR process and is injected into the HTML output. The malicious script executes when the browser parses and renders the server-rendered HTML.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Website defacement
    *   Session hijacking
*   **Affected Angular Component:**
    *   Angular Universal SSR rendering process
    *   Server-side templates or component rendering logic
    *   `DomSanitizer` service (if not used correctly in SSR context)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Apply the same sanitization principles in SSR as in CSR. Ensure all user-controlled data rendered server-side is properly sanitized using Angular's `DomSanitizer` or other appropriate server-side sanitization libraries.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Be mindful of the SSR context and ensure sanitization is effective in both server and client environments.
    *   **Code Reviews for SSR:** Carefully review SSR code paths for potential injection points and ensure proper sanitization is applied.
    *   **CSP for SSR Applications:** Implement a strict CSP for SSR applications to further mitigate the impact of XSS.
