# Attack Surface Analysis for angular/angular

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages through Angular templates, executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Angular Contribution:** Angular templates can become vulnerable if dynamic content is improperly handled and directly embedded without sanitization.  `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods, when misused, directly open this attack vector. Angular's template binding system, while generally secure, requires developer vigilance to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Displaying unsanitized user input in a template like `<div>{{ userInput }}</div>` where `userInput` comes directly from a URL parameter. An attacker injects `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` as `userInput`.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly avoid using `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
    *   **Sanitize all user-controlled data before displaying it in templates.** Rely on Angular's built-in sanitization and verify its proper application.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers** to restrict resource loading and mitigate XSS impact.
    *   **Regularly audit templates for potential injection points, especially where dynamic data is used.**

## Attack Surface: [DOM-based XSS](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss.md)

*   **Description:** XSS vulnerability where malicious script execution is triggered by manipulating the DOM directly through client-side JavaScript within the Angular application.
*   **Angular Contribution:** Angular applications are designed for extensive DOM manipulation. Direct DOM manipulation using `ElementRef.nativeElement` or similar methods, especially when combined with user-controlled data, directly creates opportunities for DOM-based XSS. Angular's component lifecycle and DOM access patterns can inadvertently lead to this vulnerability if not carefully managed.
*   **Example:** A component uses `ElementRef.nativeElement.innerHTML = userInput;` where `userInput` is from user input and unsanitized. Injection of `<img src=x onerror=alert('DOM XSS')>` as `userInput` triggers the attack.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement, redirection, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize direct DOM manipulation using `ElementRef.nativeElement`.** Prefer Angular's data binding, template directives, and Renderer2 for safer DOM interactions.
    *   **If DOM manipulation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize user input before using it to modify DOM properties like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, etc.**
    *   **Utilize Angular's Renderer2 service for safer DOM manipulation practices.**
    *   **Implement CSP headers to reduce the impact of DOM-based XSS attacks.**

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities (Security Logic in Client)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_vulnerabilities__security_logic_in_client_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical security checks, authorization, or sensitive business logic are implemented solely in client-side Angular code, making them easily bypassable by attackers.
*   **Angular Contribution:** Angular's client-side nature can mislead developers into placing security logic within Angular components or services, mistakenly believing client-side code is secure. Angular's routing and component structure might encourage developers to implement access control within the client application itself.
*   **Example:** Client-side route guards in Angular that only check user roles stored in local storage without server-side verification. Attackers can modify local storage or bypass guard logic in browser developer tools to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features, data manipulation, bypassing critical access controls, privilege escalation, potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never rely on client-side Angular code for critical security logic or authorization.**
    *   **Implement all essential security checks and authorization mechanisms on the server-side.**
    *   **Use client-side logic in Angular only for user experience enhancements and UI flow, not as a primary security layer.**
    *   **Angular route guards should be considered for UX and navigation flow control, not as a robust security mechanism. Server-side authorization is mandatory.**
