## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Angular Application [CRITICAL NODE - Top Level Goal]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_angular_application__critical_node_-_top_level_goal_.md)

*   This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their goal of compromising the application, potentially leading to various negative outcomes like data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Client-Side Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__client-side_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Client-side vulnerabilities are marked as critical because Angular applications are primarily client-side rendered. Exploiting vulnerabilities on the client-side directly impacts users and can bypass many server-side security measures.
*   Attack vectors within this node are generally more accessible to attackers and often require less sophisticated techniques compared to server-side or build-time attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Template Injection (Angular Specific XSS) [CRITICAL NODE - High-Risk Path Start]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__template_injection__angular_specific_xss___critical_node_-_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   Template Injection is a critical node and the starting point of a high-risk path due to its direct relevance to Angular's core functionality and the severity of its potential impact (XSS).
*   **Attack Vector: Untrusted Data in Templates ({{ }}) -> Inject Malicious Scripts via Data Binding [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Description:**  Angular templates use double curly braces `{{ }}` for data binding. If untrusted data, such as user input or data from external sources, is directly bound into templates without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This code will then be executed in the user's browser when the template is rendered.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers may overlook sanitization, especially when dealing with complex data flows or when assuming data is already safe. Frameworks can sometimes lull developers into a false sense of security.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful Template Injection leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). XSS can allow attackers to:
        *   Steal user session cookies and hijack user accounts.
        *   Deface the website and display misleading content.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Inject keyloggers or other malware.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge or consent.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting basic template injection is relatively easy. Attackers can often identify vulnerable points by simply injecting test strings into input fields and observing if they are rendered in the page source without proper encoding. Browser developer tools can be used to easily test and refine payloads.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Requires only a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and how web requests work. Many readily available resources and tools exist for identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - While Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Content Security Policy (CSP) can provide some detection and prevention, subtle template injection vulnerabilities can still bypass these defenses. Code review is crucial, but manual inspection may miss edge cases. Automated static analysis tools can help, but may also produce false positives or negatives.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Angular Library Vulnerabilities (Third-Party) [CRITICAL NODE - High-Risk Path Start]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__angular_library_vulnerabilities__third-party___critical_node_-_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   Third-party library vulnerabilities are critical due to the extensive use of npm packages in Angular projects. Outdated or vulnerable libraries represent a significant and often easily exploitable attack surface.
*   **Attack Vector: Outdated or Vulnerable Angular Libraries -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Description:** Angular projects rely heavily on third-party libraries from npm. If these libraries contain known security vulnerabilities and are not updated, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. Vulnerabilities can range from XSS and Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  It is common for projects to use outdated dependencies.  Developers may not always prioritize dependency updates, or may be unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities in their project's dependencies. The fast-paced nature of JavaScript development and the constant release of new library versions contribute to this likelihood.
    *   **Impact:** Significant to Critical - The impact of exploiting a library vulnerability depends on the specific vulnerability and the library's role in the application. Impacts can range from:
        *   XSS vulnerabilities within the library, leading to client-side attacks.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities that can crash the application.
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server or client, depending on where the vulnerable library code is executed.
        *   Data breaches if the vulnerable library handles sensitive data.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting *known* vulnerabilities in outdated libraries is often straightforward. Publicly available vulnerability databases and exploit code (or proof-of-concept code) are often readily accessible for known vulnerabilities. Attackers can use these resources to quickly identify and exploit vulnerable libraries in target applications.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate - Exploiting known vulnerabilities often requires only basic scripting skills and the ability to follow instructions or adapt existing exploit code. Tools and frameworks may even automate much of the exploitation process for well-known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Dependency scanning tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools can easily detect outdated and vulnerable libraries. These tools compare the project's dependencies against vulnerability databases and provide reports on identified vulnerabilities.
