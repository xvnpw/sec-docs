## Attack Tree Path: [1. Template Injection (XSS via Angular) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__template_injection__xss_via_angular___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Angular's templating engine to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is a specialized form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **1a. Unsafe Binding [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Directly using user-supplied data within Angular's data binding expressions (`{{ }}` or `[]`) without proper sanitization.
        *   **Example:** `<div>{{ userComment }}</div>` where `userComment` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1b. Bypass Sanitizer (e.g., DomSanitizer) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Circumventing Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms, typically by misusing methods like `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustScript`, etc., or by finding ways to trick the sanitizer.
        *   **Example:** Using `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` on user-supplied data without additional validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Dependency Injection](./attack_tree_paths/3__dependency_injection.md)

* **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3a. Exploit Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Leveraging a vulnerability in a legitimate, trusted third-party Angular library or other dependency.
        *   **Example:** A third-party UI component library has an XSS vulnerability that can be triggered through user input.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the specific dependency and its vulnerability)
        *   **Impact:** Variable (Often High, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability and whether it's publicly known)

    *   **3b. Malicious Package (e.g., Protractor End-to-End Testing) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker tricks the developer into installing a malicious package disguised as a legitimate one, or exploits vulnerabilities in testing frameworks (like older versions of Protractor) that have had security issues. This can include prototype pollution attacks.
        *   **Example:** An attacker publishes an npm package with a similar name to a popular library, but the package contains malicious code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Bypass Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/4__bypass_sanitization.md)

* **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **4a. Bypass DOM Sanitizer**
        *   **Description:** Similar to 1b, but focusing on specific techniques to trick or bypass the `DomSanitizer`.
        *   **Example:** Finding edge cases or specific HTML/CSS/JS combinations that the sanitizer doesn't handle correctly.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **4b. Exploit $sanitize Vulnerability**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting any known or future vulnerabilities in Angular's `$sanitize` service (less common now, but historically relevant).
        *   **Example:** If a vulnerability were found in `$sanitize` that allowed bypassing its sanitization logic.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Zone.js Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_zone_js_bugs.md)

* **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **5a. Unpatched Zone.js Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of Zone.js with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in Zone.js allows an attacker to escape the Angular context and execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If updates are applied regularly)
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low (If a public exploit exists)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **5b. Prototype Pollution in Zone.js**
        *   **Description:** Leveraging prototype pollution vulnerabilities within Zone.js to alter the behavior of the application.
        *   **Example:** An attacker finds a way to modify the prototype of a core JavaScript object, which is then used by Zone.js, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Leverage Misconfigured or Weakly Configured Angular Features](./attack_tree_paths/6__leverage_misconfigured_or_weakly_configured_angular_features.md)

* **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **6a. Improperly Configured Compiler Options**
        *   **Description:** Using insecure compiler options (e.g., disabling security features) that make the application more vulnerable.
        *   **Example:** Disabling sanitization or other security checks in the Angular compiler.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **6c. Unsafe Use of `bypass` Methods [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Incorrectly using methods like `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `bypassSecurityTrustScript`, etc., leading to XSS vulnerabilities. This is a specific, common, and dangerous form of bypassing sanitization.
        *   **Example:** Using `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` on user-supplied data without any further validation or sanitization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
