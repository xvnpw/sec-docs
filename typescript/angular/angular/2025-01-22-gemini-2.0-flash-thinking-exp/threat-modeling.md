# Threat Model Analysis for angular/angular

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Angular Templates](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_angular_templates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled data. When this data is rendered in an Angular template using data binding (`{{ }}` or attribute bindings) without proper sanitization, the injected script executes in the victim's browser. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This threat directly leverages Angular's templating engine and data binding mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution, phishing attacks.
    *   **Angular Component Affected:**  Templates, Data Binding, `DomSanitizer` (when misused), `[innerHTML]` binding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Contextual Sanitization:** Rely on Angular's built-in sanitization by default.
        *   **Avoid `[innerHTML]`:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `[innerHTML]`.
        *   **Use `DomSanitizer` with Caution:**  Use `DomSanitizer` only when absolutely necessary and with extreme care. Sanitize data before bypassing Angular's sanitization.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the impact of XSS.
        *   **Input Validation and Encoding:** Sanitize and encode user input on the server-side before sending it to the Angular application.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./threats/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates or injects code into Angular templates themselves, typically by exploiting vulnerabilities in dynamic template generation or manipulation logic. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Angular application's context.  The attacker could potentially gain full control over the client-side application and access sensitive data or functionalities. This threat directly targets Angular's template compilation and rendering process.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete client-side application compromise, sensitive data exposure, unauthorized actions, XSS-like attacks with broader scope.
    *   **Angular Component Affected:**  Templates, Template Compilation (especially in older versions or without AOT), Component Factories (if used dynamically).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Template Manipulation:**  Do not dynamically construct or manipulate Angular templates based on user input.
        *   **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:** Use AOT compilation to minimize runtime template compilation and reduce CSTI risks.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any user input that could indirectly influence template rendering logic.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any potential CSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SSR Template Injection (Server-Side Rendering Specific)](./threats/ssr_template_injection__server-side_rendering_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** If using Angular Universal for Server-Side Rendering, an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the server-side rendering process to inject malicious code into templates rendered on the server. This can lead to code execution on the server during the rendering phase, potentially compromising the server or allowing access to sensitive server-side resources. This threat is specific to Angular Universal and its server-side rendering capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Server-side code execution, server compromise, access to sensitive server-side data, denial of service.
    *   **Angular Component Affected:**  Angular Universal, Server-Side Rendering Engine, Templates rendered server-side.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure SSR Configuration:**  Properly configure and secure the SSR environment.
        *   **Input Sanitization in SSR:**  Ensure robust input sanitization is performed during the server-side rendering process, especially when handling user-provided data.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of SSR Setup:**  Conduct regular security audits of the SSR setup and code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Server-Side):** Apply the principle of least privilege to server-side processes and access controls.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to protect the SSR application from common web attacks.
