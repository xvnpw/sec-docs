## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Angular's Client-Side Nature) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__angular's_client-side_nature___critical_node__high-risk_path_214ce3eb.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the client-side execution environment of Angular applications to execute malicious code or manipulate application logic directly within the user's browser.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Angular applications are primarily client-side, meaning a significant portion of the application logic and rendering happens in the user's browser.
    *   Attackers can target this client-side execution to bypass security measures, steal data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   This category encompasses various XSS attacks and client-side logic manipulation techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into Angular templates that are dynamically rendered, leading to execution of the attacker's script in the victim's browser when the template is processed.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Angular templates use expressions and bindings to display dynamic data.
    *   If user-controlled input is incorporated into templates without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious script tags or JavaScript code within these expressions.
    *   When Angular renders the template, the injected script is executed as part of the application's context, allowing the attacker to perform actions like:
        *   Stealing session cookies or tokens.
        *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the application.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Action: Inject malicious script into Angular templates through user-controlled input. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__action_inject_malicious_script_into_angular_templates_through_user-controlled_input___high-ri_2b12fd0b.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting user inputs that are directly or indirectly used in Angular templates without proper sanitization.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers identify input fields, URL parameters, or other sources of user-controlled data that are reflected in the application's templates.
    *   They craft malicious input strings containing JavaScript code.
    *   If the application fails to sanitize or escape this input before rendering it in the template, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might inject `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` into a comment field, and if this comment is displayed in a template without sanitization, the `alert('XSS')` will execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Build Process & Dependencies (Angular Ecosystem) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_build_process_&_dependencies__angular_ecosystem___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Compromising the application's build process or its dependencies within the Angular ecosystem (primarily npm packages) to inject malicious code or vulnerabilities into the final application artifact.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Modern Angular applications rely heavily on build tools (Angular CLI) and a vast ecosystem of npm packages.
    *   Attackers can target vulnerabilities in this ecosystem to compromise applications at scale.
    *   This category includes supply chain attacks and build script manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious npm Packages [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__supply_chain_attacks_via_malicious_npm_packages__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Introducing malicious or vulnerable code into the application by compromising npm packages that are dependencies of the Angular project.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Angular projects declare dependencies in `package.json`, which are downloaded and included during the build process.
    *   Attackers can compromise npm packages in several ways:
        *   **Compromising legitimate package maintainer accounts:** Gaining access to maintainer accounts to publish malicious updates to existing packages.
        *   **Typosquatting:** Creating packages with names similar to popular packages, hoping developers will mistakenly install the malicious package.
        *   **Injecting vulnerabilities into legitimate packages:**  Submitting pull requests with malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities in the package update process.
    *   If a compromised package is included in the application's dependencies, the malicious code within the package will be executed as part of the application, potentially leading to:
        *   Data theft.
        *   Backdoors.
        *   Application malfunction.
        *   Wider supply chain compromise if the affected package is widely used.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Action: Compromise application by using malicious or vulnerable npm packages in `package.json` dependencies. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__action_compromise_application_by_using_malicious_or_vulnerable_npm_packages_in__package_json__133d5115.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting the `package.json` file and the npm dependency resolution process to introduce compromised packages into the Angular project.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers aim to get developers to install or update to a version of an npm package that contains malicious code.
    *   This can be achieved through the methods described in 3.1 (package compromise, typosquatting, etc.).
    *   Once a compromised package is listed in `package.json` and installed (e.g., via `npm install` or `yarn install`), the malicious code becomes part of the application's codebase and build output.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Angular Specific Security Feature Bypasses (Circumventing Protections)](./attack_tree_paths/4__angular_specific_security_feature_bypasses__circumventing_protections_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses or misconfigurations in Angular's built-in security features, or developer misuse of these features, to bypass intended security protections.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Angular provides security features like built-in sanitization and encourages the use of CSP.
    *   However, these features can be bypassed if not used correctly or if developers introduce vulnerabilities through misuse or custom implementations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Bypassing Angular Sanitization (If Misused) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__bypassing_angular_sanitization__if_misused___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Circumventing Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms, often through the misuse of `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods or flawed custom sanitization logic, to inject malicious content that would otherwise be blocked.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Angular sanitizes HTML by default to prevent XSS.
    *   Developers can use `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods to explicitly bypass sanitization in specific cases.
    *   Misuse of `bypassSecurityTrust...` (e.g., bypassing sanitization for user-controlled input without careful validation) can re-introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Similarly, if developers implement custom sanitization logic that is flawed or incomplete, it can be bypassed by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Action: Find vulnerabilities in custom sanitization logic or misuse of `bypassSecurityTrust...` to inject malicious content. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__action_find_vulnerabilities_in_custom_sanitization_logic_or_misuse_of__bypasssecuritytrust____ad48a1cb.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting code sections where developers have bypassed Angular's default sanitization or implemented custom sanitization, looking for weaknesses that allow for XSS injection.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers analyze the codebase for instances of `bypassSecurityTrust...` and custom sanitization functions.
    *   They then attempt to craft payloads that can bypass these custom or bypassed sanitization mechanisms and inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** If a developer uses `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` on user input after a weak regex-based sanitization, an attacker might craft an input that bypasses the regex but is still executed as HTML.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Weaknesses (Angular Context) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__content_security_policy__csp__weaknesses__angular_context___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting overly permissive or misconfigured Content Security Policy (CSP) directives to inject scripts or bypass the intended restrictions of the CSP, effectively negating its XSS protection.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   CSP is a browser security mechanism that helps prevent XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    *   A poorly configured CSP can be ineffective or even bypassed. Common CSP misconfigurations include:
        *   **Overly permissive `script-src` directives:** Allowing `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, or overly broad whitelists (e.g., `*`).
        *   **Missing or weak `object-src` or `base-uri` directives.**
        *   **Allowing vulnerable CDNs or third-party scripts.**
    *   If CSP is weak, attackers can potentially inject scripts or bypass its protections, leading to XSS even with CSP enabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Action: Exploit overly permissive or misconfigured CSP to inject scripts or bypass restrictions. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__action_exploit_overly_permissive_or_misconfigured_csp_to_inject_scripts_or_bypass_restriction_3fa62eb6.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Analyzing the application's CSP configuration to identify weaknesses and then crafting attacks that exploit these weaknesses to bypass CSP and achieve XSS or other security compromises.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers examine the CSP headers sent by the application.
    *   They look for common misconfigurations or overly permissive directives.
    *   Based on the CSP weaknesses, they craft attack payloads that can bypass the CSP restrictions.
    *   **Example:** If CSP allows `unsafe-inline`, attackers can inject inline `<script>` tags. If CSP allows a vulnerable CDN, attackers might compromise the CDN to inject malicious scripts.
