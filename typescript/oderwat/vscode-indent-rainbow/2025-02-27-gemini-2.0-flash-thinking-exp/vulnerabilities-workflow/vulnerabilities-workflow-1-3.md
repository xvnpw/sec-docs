### Vulnerability List for Indent-Rainbow VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Regex Injection in `ignoreLinePatterns` leading to incorrect highlighting

* Description:
    1. The Indent-Rainbow extension allows users to configure regular expressions via the `indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns` setting to define lines that should be excluded from error highlighting.
    2. The extension takes string values from this setting and directly creates `RegExp` objects without sufficient validation or sanitization.
    3. A malicious user can inject a crafted regular expression string into the `indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns` setting.
    4. This injected regex can then interfere with the extension's core logic for indentation highlighting.
    5. As a result, the extension may exhibit incorrect or disrupted highlighting behavior, such as disabling highlighting entirely or misidentifying indentation errors.

* Impact:
    - Incorrect or disrupted indentation highlighting.
    - The extension can become ineffective or misleading, reducing user productivity.
    - Users may become confused about the actual indentation in their code due to incorrect highlighting.
    - While not leading to direct data breach or code execution, it degrades the intended functionality and user experience significantly.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly parses and uses user-provided regex strings from the configuration without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement validation for the regex strings provided in `indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns` to prevent injection of harmful or unintended patterns.
    - **Restrict regex features:** Consider limiting the allowed features within user-provided regexes to reduce the potential for complex or disruptive patterns.
    - **Documentation warning:** Add a clear warning in the extension's documentation advising users about the potential risks of using complex or untrusted regular expressions in `ignoreLinePatterns`.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Indent-Rainbow extension installed in VSCode.
    - The user must be able to modify VSCode settings, specifically the `indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns` setting. This is typically possible for any user of VSCode.

* Source code analysis:
    1. In `/code/src/extension.ts`, the `activate` function retrieves the `ignoreLinePatterns` configuration:
    ```typescript
    const ignoreLinePatterns = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('indentRainbow')['ignoreLinePatterns'] || [];
    ```
    2. The code then iterates through `ignoreLinePatterns` and attempts to parse each string item into a `RegExp` object:
    ```typescript
    ignoreLinePatterns.forEach((ignorePattern,index) => {
      if (typeof ignorePattern === 'string') {
        //parse the string for a regex
        var regParts = ignorePattern.match(/^\/(.*?)\/([gim]*)$/);
        if (regParts) {
          // the parsed pattern had delimiters and modifiers. handle them.
          ignoreLinePatterns[index] = new RegExp(regParts[1], regParts[2]);
        } else {
          // we got pattern string without delimiters
          ignoreLinePatterns[index] = new RegExp(ignorePattern);
        }
      }
    });
    ```
    - `new RegExp(ignorePattern)` directly creates a regular expression from the user-provided string `ignorePattern`. This is the point where regex injection is possible.
    3. Later in the `updateDecorations` function, these `ignoreLinePatterns` regexes are used to identify lines to be excluded from error highlighting:
    ```typescript
    ignoreLinePatterns.forEach(ignorePattern => {
      while (ignore = ignorePattern.exec(text)) {
        const pos = activeEditor.document.positionAt(ignore.index);
        const line = activeEditor.document.lineAt(pos).lineNumber;
        ignoreLines.push(line);
      }
    });
    ```
    - The `ignorePattern.exec(text)` method executes the user-provided regex against the document text. A malicious regex here can disrupt the intended logic of identifying lines for error highlighting and potentially more.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup:** Install the "Indent-Rainbow" extension in VSCode.
    2. **Configuration:** Open VSCode settings (Settings -> Open Settings (JSON)) and add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:
    ```json
    "indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns": [
        ".*"
    ]
    ```
    This regex `.*` is designed to match any character (except newline) zero or more times, effectively matching every line of code.
    3. **Open Code File:** Open any code file with indentation (e.g., a Python or JavaScript file) in VSCode.
    4. **Observe Highlighting:** Observe the indentation highlighting in the opened code file.
    5. **Expected Result:** Indentation highlighting should be applied based on the code's indentation structure. However, due to the injected regex `.*` in `ignoreLinePatterns`, the extension will likely treat every line as matching the ignore pattern. Consequently, indentation highlighting, especially error highlighting, should be disabled or severely disrupted across the entire document.
    6. **Actual Result:** Verify that indentation highlighting is indeed disabled or significantly disrupted. For instance, error highlighting for incorrect indentation should no longer appear, and the rainbow color highlighting might also be absent or inconsistent. This confirms that a malicious regex injected via `ignoreLinePatterns` can negatively impact the extension's functionality.
