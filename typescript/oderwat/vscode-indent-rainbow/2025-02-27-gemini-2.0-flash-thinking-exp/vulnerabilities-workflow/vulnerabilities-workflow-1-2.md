- **Vulnerability Name**: CSS Injection via Unsanitized Color Configuration
  - **Description**:
    The extension reads several style values (such as `errorColor`, `tabmixColor`, and the entries inside `colors`) directly from the user’s workspace configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('indentRainbow')` and then passes these values straight to VSCode’s decoration API (via calls like `vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType`). An attacker who is able to supply a malicious workspace settings file (for example, as part of a repository’s `.vscode/settings.json`) may override these configuration values with strings that contain CSS payloads or extra CSS properties. When the extension creates the decoration types without validating or sanitizing these inputs, the malicious payload may be injected into the resulting style rules.
    *Step by step triggering scenario*:
    1. The attacker hosts a repository (or provides a malicious workspace) that includes a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. This file overrides the indent‑rainbow configuration properties with malicious strings (for example, providing an `errorColor` value like `"red; background-image:url(javascript:alert('XSS'))"`).
    3. When a victim opens the workspace in VSCode with the Indent‑Rainbow extension installed, the extension fetches these configuration values without checking that they conform to a safe CSS color format.
    4. The extension then creates text editor decoration types with these values.
    5. The malicious CSS payload gets applied to the decoration elements, potentially altering the visual presentation of the user interface.

  - **Impact**:
    An attacker can use this vulnerability to modify the look of the code editor in a way that may mislead the user. For example, injected CSS rules might overlay UI elements, obscure warnings, or mimic trusted dialogs (a form of UI spoofing). Although this does not lead to direct code execution, it can be used as part of a larger social engineering attack or to trick users into taking unsafe actions.

  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - The extension relies on VSCode’s API to create decoration types; however, it does not perform any sanitization or validation of the configuration values it retrieves.
    - No additional code-level checks or filters are implemented to ensure that the supplied color strings conform to expected CSS color formats.

  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    - Input validation/sanitization: The extension should validate and constrain configuration values before using them. For example, it could enforce that any color strings match a whitelist of allowed CSS color formats (such as `rgba(...)` patterns or known color names).
    - Defensive coding: Apply parsing logic or use helper libraries that can safely interpret and reject malicious CSS input.

  - **Preconditions**:
    - The user opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides one or more Indent‑Rainbow configuration properties (e.g. `indentRainbow.errorColor`, `indentRainbow.colors`, or `indentRainbow.tabmixColor`).
    - The user has not overridden or sanitized the settings manually, so the extension uses the attacker-controlled values immediately on activation.
    - The victim is using the extension in a VSCode instance that supports decoration styles without additional sanitization.

  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. In the file `src/extension.ts`, the extension fetches configuration values as follows:
       - For error color:
         ```ts
         const error_color = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('indentRainbow')['errorColor'] || "rgba(128,32,32,0.3)";
         const error_decoration_type = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
           backgroundColor: error_color
         });
         ```
       2. Similarly, for the set of colors used in decorating indent levels, the code retrieves the colors array:
         ```ts
         const colors = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('indentRainbow')['colors'] || [
           "rgba(255,255,64,0.07)",
           "rgba(127,255,127,0.07)",
           "rgba(255,127,255,0.07)",
           "rgba(79,236,236,0.07)"
         ];
         ```
         The code then loops over these values and uses them to create decoration types (either setting background colors directly or applying them as border colors for the “light” mode).
    3. No sanitization logic is present before the color values are passed to the decoration API. This means that if an attacker substitutes a value with additional CSS syntax or malicious CSS rules, those payloads will be embedded in the decoration’s style.

  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup Malicious Workspace**:
       - Create a repository (or workspace) that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
         ```json
         {
           "indentRainbow.errorColor": "red; background-image:url(javascript:alert('XSS'))",
           "indentRainbow.colors": [
             "blue",
             "green",
             "purple",
             "yellow"
           ]
         }
         ```
    2. **Open the Workspace**:
       - Open the repository/workspace in Visual Studio Code you have configured with the Indent‑Rainbow extension.
    3. **Observe Extension Behavior**:
       - Allow the extension to activate and process the configuration on startup.
       - Inspect the editor’s decorations (for example, by opening a file with indented content) and look for signs that the CSS injected via `errorColor` has affected the UI styling beyond the intended background color.
    4. **Detection of Malicious Effects**:
       - Verify whether the malicious payload (such as the extra `background-image` rule) is applied. This might be observable as unexpected UI behavior, altered decoration rendering, or if possible, by inspecting the computed styles in a developer tool (if available in VSCode).
    5. **Conclusion**:
       - If the malicious CSS is successfully injected and alters the UI, this confirms that unsanitized configuration values can be exploited for CSS injection.
