- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Overwrite via Gulp Task `vsix:release:package` and `signVsix`
- Description: An attacker who can modify the repository, or somehow influence the CI pipeline, can overwrite arbitrary files during the VSIX packaging and signing process. The gulp tasks `vsix:release:package` and `signVsix` in `/code/gulpfile.ts` use file operations (copy, move, etc.) that, if maliciously crafted, could be made to overwrite files outside the intended `vsix/` and `out/` directories. For example, by modifying the `signJs/signJs.proj` or `signVsix.proj` files, or the gulpfile itself, an attacker could introduce file paths that lead to overwriting sensitive files during the build process.
- Impact: Critical. Arbitrary file overwrite can lead to complete system compromise, including code injection, data corruption, and unauthorized access. In the context of a VSCode extension, this could mean injecting malicious code into the extension itself, which would then be distributed to users.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code relies on the integrity of the build scripts and project files, which can be compromised.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for all file paths used in file operations within the gulp tasks.
    - Restricting file operations to only the intended directories (e.g., `vsix/` and `out/`).
    - Implementing integrity checks for build scripts to detect unauthorized modifications.
    - Using secure file operation methods that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the repository or influence the CI pipeline to modify build scripts.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/gulpfile.ts`
    - The gulpfile orchestrates the build and packaging process, including calling external scripts for signing.
    - Tasks like `gulp vsix:release:package` and `gulp signVsix` involve file operations that could be manipulated to write to arbitrary locations.
    - File: `/code/msbuild/signing/signVsix.proj` and `/code/msbuild/signing/signJs.proj`
    - These project files are used for signing and are part of the build process. Malicious modifications here could lead to unintended file operations.

        J --> K[Potential Arbitrary File Overwrite]
    ```
- Security test case:
    1.  Fork the `vscode-csharp` repository.
    2.  Modify the `/code/gulpfile.ts` file, specifically within the `vsix:release:package` task, to introduce a malicious file operation. For example, attempt to overwrite a file in the user's home directory during the VSIX creation process.
    3.  Run the gulp task locally using `npm run vsix:release:package:win32`.
    4.  Observe if the malicious file overwrite is successful. In a safe test environment, verify if a file outside the intended output directories (e.g., a file in your user home directory) is overwritten.
    5.  Alternatively, modify `signVsix.proj` or `signJs.proj` to include a malicious file overwrite and run `gulp signVsix` or `npm run vscode:prepublish`.
    6.  If successful, this demonstrates the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `azure-pipelines.yml` via `testVSCodeVersion` Variable
- Description: The `azure-pipelines.yml` file uses a variable `testVSCodeVersion` to determine the VSCode version for testing. This variable is set based on the build reason, but it could potentially be influenced or manipulated by an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `npm run test:unit` or similar test commands within the pipeline. If an attacker can control the `Build.Reason` or other pipeline variables used to set `testVSCodeVersion`, they could inject malicious commands.
- Impact: High. Command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build agent, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or compromising the build pipeline.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The pipeline script directly uses the variable in command execution without sanitization.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `testVSCodeVersion` variable.
    - Ensuring that pipeline variables are set only from trusted sources and are not directly influenced by external inputs.
    - Using secure methods for executing commands that prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to be able to influence the Azure DevOps pipeline variables, especially `Build.Reason` or other variables used to derive `testVSCodeVersion`.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/azure-pipelines.yml`
    - The `testVSCodeVersion` variable is defined based on `Build.Reason`:
    ```yaml
    variables:
    - name: testVSCodeVersion
      ${{ if eq( variables['Build.Reason'], 'Schedule' ) }}:
        value: insiders
      ${{ else }}:
        value: stable
    ```
    - This variable is then used in the `azure-pipelines/test-matrix.yml` template within `npm run test:unit` and similar commands:
    ```yaml
    - script: npm run ${{ parameters.npmCommand }}
      displayName: ðŸ§ª Run $(Agent.JobName)
      env:
        DISPLAY: :99.0
        CODE_VERSION: ${{ parameters.testVSCodeVersion }}
    ```
    - If `parameters.npmCommand` or `parameters.testVSCodeVersion` are attacker-controlled or influenced, then command injection is possible.
    - Visualization:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[azure-pipelines.yml] --> B{Set testVSCodeVersion Variable};
        B --> C{npm run ${{parameters.npmCommand}}};
        C --> D[Command Execution with testVSCodeVersion];
        D --> E[Potential Command Injection];
    ```
- Security test case:
    1.  Fork the `vscode-csharp` repository.
    2.  Modify the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to directly use an attacker-controlled variable or input to set the `testVSCodeVersion`. For example, introduce a new pipeline parameter and use it directly.
    3.  Run the pipeline (this might require setting up a test pipeline in Azure DevOps).
    4.  Observe the output logs for the test execution step. If you can inject and execute arbitrary commands (e.g., `echo injected_command`), this demonstrates the vulnerability.
    5.  Example malicious modification in `azure-pipelines.yml`:
        ```yaml
        parameters:
        - name: maliciousInput
          type: string
          default: 'stable'

        variables:
        - template: /azure-pipelines/dotnet-variables.yml@self
        - name: testVSCodeVersion
          value: '$(maliciousInput)' # Directly using malicious input

        stages:
        - stage: Test_OmniSharp
          displayName: Test OmniSharp
          dependsOn: []
          jobs:
          - job: Test
            pool:
              vmImage: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - template: azure-pipelines/test-omnisharp.yml
              parameters:
                dotnetVersion: $(defaultDotnetVersion)
                testVSCodeVersion: $(testVSCodeVersion)
        ```
        Set the pipeline parameter `maliciousInput` to `stable && echo injected_command`.
