- Vulnerability name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Command Injection in Remote Attach Picker
- Description:
  1. An attacker aims to execute arbitrary commands on a remote machine by injecting malicious commands into the `pipeArgs` or `pipeProgram` of a debug configuration when using remote attach functionality.
  2. The `RemoteAttachPicker` constructs a command string using `pipeProgram` and `pipeArgs` from the `launch.json` configuration.
  3. If an attacker can control the `pipeArgs` or `pipeProgram` values (e.g., through a malicious workspace or by compromising user settings), they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
  4. The `RemoteAttachPicker.getRemoteOSAndProcesses` function then executes this constructed command on the remote machine using `child_process.exec`.
  5. Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of `pipeArgs` and `pipeProgram`, the injected commands are executed by the shell.
  6. The attacker achieves arbitrary command execution on the remote machine.
- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the remote machine where the debugging session is initiated. This can lead to:
    - Remote System Compromise: The attacker can gain complete control over the remote system.
    - Data Breach: The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the remote system.
    - Lateral Movement: The attacker can use the compromised remote system as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  There are no mitigations implemented in the project to prevent command injection in the `RemoteAttachPicker` based on the provided files. The code constructs and executes shell commands from configuration settings without sufficient validation. The `ValidateAndFixPipeProgram` function in `/code/src/shared/processPicker.ts` only attempts to fix paths for Windows System32/sysnative, not to prevent command injection.
- Missing mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should implement robust input validation and sanitization for `pipeProgram` and `pipeArgs` in the `launch.json` configuration. This should include:
    - Whitelisting allowed characters and commands.
    - Escaping shell metacharacters if direct shell execution is unavoidable. However, parameterized execution or using safer APIs to avoid shell invocation is strongly recommended.
    - Validating the structure and content of `pipeArgs` to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious commands.
  - Principle of least privilege: If possible, the remote attach process should be run with the minimum privileges necessary to perform its function, limiting the impact of successful command injection.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `launch.json` configuration, specifically the `pipeTransport.pipeProgram` and `pipeTransport.pipeArgs` settings. This can be achieved through:
    - Malicious Workspace: Creating a malicious workspace that includes a `.vscode/launch.json` with injected commands.
    - User Settings Compromise: Compromising the user's VS Code settings to modify default debug configurations.
  - The user must attempt to use the "Attach to Process" feature with a debug configuration that uses `pipeTransport` and is configured with the attacker's malicious commands.
- Source code analysis:
  The vulnerability exists in `/code/src/shared/processPicker.ts` within the `RemoteAttachPicker` class, specifically in the `createPipeCmd`, `createPipeCmdFromArray`, and `getRemoteOSAndProcesses` functions.

  **Analysis Steps:**

  1. **`createPipeCmdFromString` and `createPipeCmdFromArray` [1, 2]:** These functions handle different types of `pipeArgs` (string or array).
  2. **`createPipeCmdFromString` [3, 4]:**  It constructs the command string by concatenating `pipeProgram`, `pipeArgs`, and `scriptShellCmd`. Crucially, there's no sanitization or validation of `pipeArgs` before concatenation. The replacement of `${debuggerCommand}` also doesn't involve sanitization.
  3. **`createPipeCmdFromArray` [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:** This function similarly constructs the command. It iterates through `pipeArgs` (if array), replaces `${debuggerCommand}`, and joins the components into a final command string. No sanitization is performed on `pipeArgs` or individual arguments before they are added to the command. Quoting is applied at the end, but this is insufficient to prevent command injection if malicious commands are already part of `pipeArgs`.
  4. **`getRemoteOSAndProcesses` [10, 11]:** This function receives the constructed `pipeCmd` and executes it using `execChildProcessAndOutputErrorToChannel`. The command is executed via a shell (`< "${scriptPath}"`), which is susceptible to command injection if `pipeCmd` contains malicious shell commands.

  This analysis demonstrates that the `RemoteAttachPicker` is vulnerable to command injection because it constructs and executes shell commands from user-controlled configuration settings (`pipeArgs`, `pipeProgram`) without proper input validation or sanitization.

- Security test case:
  **Test Case: Command Injection via Malicious `pipeArgs` in Remote Attach**

  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - You need a remote machine accessible via SSH or a similar pipe transport mechanism that the C# extension's remote attach feature supports. For testing purposes, you can use a local virtual machine or container.
     - Ensure you have a .NET Core application running on the remote machine that you can attach to.
     - Configure VS Code for remote debugging to your test environment.

  2. **Create a Malicious `launch.json` Configuration:**
     - Open your VS Code workspace.
     - Go to "Run and Debug" (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D).
     - Click "create a configuration" and select ".NET Core Attach".
     - Modify the generated `launch.json` configuration to include `pipeTransport` and inject a malicious command into `pipeArgs`. Replace the relevant parts of your `launch.json` with the following, adjusting paths and connection details as needed for your test environment.

     ```json
     {
         "name": ".NET Core Remote Attach - Command Injection Test",
         "type": "coreclr",
         "request": "attach",
         "processId": "${command:pickProcess}",
         "pipeTransport": {
             "pipeProgram": "ssh",
             "pipeArgs": [
                 "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no", // For testing, disable host key checking, remove in real scenarios
                 "-i", "/path/to/your/privateKey", // Replace with your SSH private key path
                 "user@your-remote-host", // Replace with your remote host address
                 "`touch /tmp/pwned.txt; ${debuggerCommand}`" // [INJECTED COMMAND] - Creates /tmp/pwned.txt on remote host
             ],
             "debuggerPath": "/path/to/vsdbg/on/remote/machine/vsdbg", // Replace with the actual debugger path on the remote machine
             "quoteArgs": false, // Important: Set to false to prevent quoting that might break injection
             "pipeCwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
         },
         "sourceFileMap": {
             "/Views": "${workspaceFolder}/Views"
         }
     }
     ```
     **Important Notes in the Malicious Configuration:**
        - **`pipeArgs`**: This is where the command injection happens.
          - `` `touch /tmp/pwned.txt; ${debuggerCommand}` ``: This is the injected command. It attempts to create a file named `pwned.txt` in the `/tmp` directory on the remote machine and then executes the original debugger command (`${debuggerCommand}`). The backticks (`` ` ``) are used for command substitution within the SSH command, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands. For Windows remote targets use `"` instead of backticks and adjust command accordingly.
        - **`quoteArgs: false`**: Setting `quoteArgs` to `false` is crucial. If set to `true`, the arguments might be quoted, which could prevent the command injection from working as intended by escaping the backticks or other injection characters. However, in real-world scenarios, attackers will try both quoted and unquoted variations.
        - **`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` and `-i /path/to/your/privateKey`**: These SSH options are for convenience in a testing environment. **Do not use `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` in production or real attack scenarios.** Replace `/path/to/your/privateKey` with the actual path to your SSH private key for authentication.
        - **`/path/to/vsdbg/on/remote/machine/vsdbg`**: Ensure this `debuggerPath` is correct for your remote machine and architecture.

  3. **Initiate Debugging:**
     - Select the newly created debug configuration (".NET Core Remote Attach - Command Injection Test") in the Run and Debug view.
     - Start debugging. VS Code will attempt to attach the debugger to the remote process using the configured `pipeTransport`.

  4. **Verify Command Execution on Remote Machine:**
     - After starting the debug session (or attempting to, even if it fails to attach due to the injected command interfering), connect to your remote machine (e.g., via SSH separately).
     - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists on the remote machine.
     - If `/tmp/pwned.txt` is present, it confirms that the injected `touch /tmp/pwned.txt` command was successfully executed on the remote machine, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability.

  5. **Clean up:**
     - Delete the `/tmp/pwned.txt` file from the remote machine.
     - Remove or correct the malicious debug configuration in `launch.json`.

  **Expected Result:**
  The test should result in the creation of `/tmp/pwned.txt` on the remote machine, indicating successful command injection. Even if the debugger fails to attach because of the injected command, the fact that the file is created is proof of the vulnerability.

  **Security Risk:**
  This test case demonstrates a **high-severity Remote Command Execution vulnerability**. An attacker who can influence the `pipeArgs` in a debug configuration can execute arbitrary commands on a remote machine when a user initiates a debugging session with that configuration. This has severe security implications, potentially leading to full system compromise of the remote machine.
