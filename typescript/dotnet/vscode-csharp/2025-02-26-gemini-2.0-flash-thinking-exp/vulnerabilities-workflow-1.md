## Combined Vulnerability List

This document consolidates vulnerabilities identified across multiple lists for the C# for Visual Studio Code Extension. Duplicate entries have been removed, and similar vulnerabilities have been grouped for clarity.

### 1. Malicious Language Server/Executable Path Configuration

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Language Server/Executable Path Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) or executable containing arbitrary code.
    2.  The attacker creates a specially crafted Visual Studio Code workspace.
    3.  Within this workspace, the attacker places a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder.
    4.  This `settings.json` file is configured to override the default C# language server path (`dotnet.server.path`) or Razor language server directory (`razor.languageServer.directory`) with the path to the attacker's malicious DLL or executable, or a directory containing it. For `razor.languageServer.directory`, the attacker would need to place a malicious `rzls.dll` (or `rzls.exe` on some platforms) in the specified directory.
    5.  Alternatively, for a more generic "Unsanitized Language Server Executable Path" vulnerability, the attacker simply needs to ensure the extension loads a workspace with a crafted language server executable path.
    6.  The attacker distributes this malicious workspace (e.g., via social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project repository).
    7.  A victim user, unaware of the malicious configuration, opens this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the C# extension installed.
    8.  Upon workspace initialization, the C# extension or Razor extension reads the `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` setting from `settings.json`.
    9.  Instead of launching the legitimate C# or Razor language server, the extension unknowingly executes the malicious DLL or executable specified in the `settings.json` as the language server, or in case of `razor.languageServer.directory` setting, the malicious `rzls.dll` or `rzls.exe` from the configured directory.
    10. The malicious code executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
    *   Potential for data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise, depending on the attacker's payload in the malicious code.
    *   Complete compromise of the user's development environment within the workspace context, potentially leading to lateral network movement and host compromise.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Reliance on VS Code’s configuration trust model.
    *   Documentation advises users to open only trusted workspaces.
    *   None apparent from the provided project files regarding input validation or sanitization of the language server paths.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization for the `dotnet.server.path` and `razor.languageServer.directory` settings.
    *   Restriction of these settings to prevent loading DLLs, executables, or directories from arbitrary file system locations, especially user-writable directories or remote URLs.
    *   Consider restricting the configuration of language server paths programmatically or through UI settings only, and disallowing direct modification via `settings.json` for security-sensitive settings.
    *   Implementation of code signing and verification for the language server DLL/executables to ensure only trusted components are loaded.
    *   Implement checks to ensure that the configured path points to an executable file with expected characteristics and from a trusted location.
    *   Additional runtime sanitization or canonicalization of the executable path.
    *   Enforcement of a strict whitelist or digital signature verification for executables.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The victim user has the C# for Visual Studio Code extension installed.
    *   The attacker can deliver a malicious workspace to the victim and convince the victim to open it in VS Code.
    *   The victim opens a workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides `dotnet.server.path` or `razor.languageServer.directory` to point to a malicious DLL, executable, or a directory containing malicious Razor language server executable.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   Based on the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, the extension reads the `dotnet.server.path` and `razor.languageServer.directory` settings from the workspace's `settings.json` file.
    *   The `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides instructions for developers to configure these settings for debugging local language server builds, implying direct usage without validation.
    *   Review of project files like `/code/src/shared/options.ts` and `/code/src/shared/constants/hostExecutableInformation.ts` confirms that these settings are read and used to determine the language server executable path.
    *   Specifically, `/code/src/shared/options.ts` defines the `serverPath` option, and it's read in `CommonOptionsImpl.serverPath`. There is no validation or sanitization applied when reading this or `razorServerPath` in `RazorOptionsImpl.razorServerPath`.
    *   The extension obtains the language server executable path from the workspace configuration using standard Node APIs and passes this path directly to the process-spawning function without adequate validation.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare a Malicious DLL/Executable:**
        *   Create a simple C# DLL or executable project (e.g., using `dotnet new classlib` or `dotnet new console`).
        *   In the code, add code that performs a visible action, such as creating a file in a temporary directory.
        *   Build the project and locate the output DLL or executable file.
        *   Place this malicious file in a known location on your test machine, for example, `/tmp/malicious_server.dll` or `/tmp/malicious_server`.
    2.  **Create a Malicious Workspace:**
        *   Create a new empty folder named `vuln_workspace`.
        *   Inside `vuln_workspace`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
        *   Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
        *   Add the following JSON configuration to `settings.json` to target `dotnet.server.path`:
            ```json
            {
                "dotnet.server.path": "/tmp/malicious_server.dll",
                "dotnet.server.waitForDebugger": false
            }
            ```
        *   Alternatively, to target `razor.languageServer.directory`, use:
            ```json
            {
                "razor.languageServer.directory": "/tmp/",
                "razor.languageServer.debug": true
            }
            ```
            *   If testing `razor.languageServer.directory`, ensure a malicious `rzls.dll` or `rzls.exe` is placed in `/tmp/`.
    3.  **Open the Malicious Workspace in VS Code:**
        *   Open Visual Studio Code.
        *   Open the `vuln_workspace` folder using "File" -> "Open Folder...".
        *   Ensure the C# extension is activated.
        *   Open or create a C# or Razor file within the `vuln_workspace` as appropriate for the targeted setting.
    4.  **Verify Malicious Code Execution:**
        *   Check if the malicious code has been executed by verifying the side effect. For example, check if the file `malicious_code_executed.txt` has been created in the temporary directory.
        *   If the file exists, it confirms the vulnerability.

### 2. Malicious Extension Plugin Path Configuration

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Extension Plugin Path Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious Visual Studio Code extension plugin (DLL).
    2.  The attacker creates a specially crafted Visual Studio Code workspace or tricks user into modifying user settings.
    3.  The attacker configures the `dotnet.server.extensionPaths` setting in `settings.json` (workspace or user settings) to include a path to a directory containing the malicious plugin DLL.
    4.  The attacker distributes this malicious workspace or instructions to modify user settings (e.g., via social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project repository).
    5.  A victim user, unaware of the malicious configuration, opens this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the C# extension installed, or applies the malicious user settings.
    6.  Upon extension initialization or workspace load, the C# extension reads the `dotnet.server.extensionPaths` setting.
    7.  The extension loads and executes the malicious plugin DLL specified in the configured path within the language server process.
    8.  The malicious plugin DLL executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the language server process and consequently VS Code process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution within the language server process and VS Code process.
    *   Potential for data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise, depending on the attacker's payload in the malicious plugin DLL.
    *   Complete compromise of the user's development environment within the workspace context or even beyond if user settings are modified.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None apparent from the provided project files. The extension appears to load extension plugins from user-configurable paths without explicit validation or security checks.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization for the `dotnet.server.extensionPaths` setting.
    *   Restriction of these settings to prevent loading plugin DLLs from arbitrary file system locations, especially user-writable directories or remote URLs.
    *   Consider restricting the configuration of extension plugin paths programmatically or through UI settings only, and disallowing direct modification via `settings.json` for security-sensitive settings.
    *   Implementation of code signing and verification for the extension plugin DLLs to ensure only trusted components are loaded.
    *   Implement checks to ensure that the configured paths point to directories containing expected plugin files from trusted locations.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The victim user has the C# for Visual Studio Code extension installed.
    *   The attacker can deliver a malicious workspace or instructions to modify user settings to the victim and convince the victim to open it in VS Code or modify settings.
    *   The victim opens a workspace or modifies user settings containing a `.vscode/settings.json` or `settings.json` that overrides `dotnet.server.extensionPaths` to point to a malicious plugin DLL directory.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The `scanExtensionPlugins` function in `/code/src/lsptoolshost/activate.ts` retrieves extension paths from `extension.packageJSON.contributes?.['csharpExtensionLoadPaths']` and `languageServerOptions.extensionsPaths`.
    *   `languageServerOptions.extensionsPaths` is read directly from settings without validation in `/code/src/shared/options.ts`.
    *   These paths are concatenated and passed to the language server process as command-line arguments, leading to potential loading of malicious plugins.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare a Malicious Plugin DLL:**
        *   Create a simple C# DLL project.
        *   In the DLL's code, add code that performs a visible action, like creating a file in a temporary directory.
        *   Build the DLL project and locate the output DLL file.
        *   Create a folder, e.g., `/tmp/malicious_plugins`, and place `MaliciousPlugin.dll` inside it.
    2.  **Configure Malicious Extension Plugin Path:**
        *   Open VS Code settings (User or Workspace settings).
        *   Add or modify the `dotnet.server.extensionPaths` setting to include `/tmp/malicious_plugins`. Use workspace settings by creating `.vscode/settings.json` and adding:
            ```json
            {
                "dotnet.server.extensionPaths": ["/tmp/malicious_plugins"]
            }
            ```
    3.  **Restart or Reload VS Code:**
        *   Restart VS Code or reload the window to apply settings.
        *   Ensure the C# extension is activated.
        *   Open or create any C# file in any workspace.
    4.  **Verify Malicious Plugin Code Execution:**
        *   Check if the malicious plugin DLL has been executed by verifying the side effect, such as the creation of `malicious_plugin_code_executed.txt` in the temporary directory.
        *   If the file exists, it confirms the vulnerability.

### 3. Command Injection via Unsanitized Debugger Launch Configurations

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Debugger Launch Configurations
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious `launch.json` configuration file.
    2.  This `launch.json` file, embedded within a malicious workspace, contains command-line arguments with shell metacharacters.
    3.  The attacker distributes this malicious workspace and convinces a victim to open it in VS Code.
    4.  When the victim initiates a debug session using this configuration, the extension parses the `launch.json` file.
    5.  The extension processes portions of the configuration, including the malicious command-line arguments, without proper sanitization against shell metacharacters.
    6.  These unsanitized arguments are passed to a process launcher.
    7.  Due to the lack of sanitization, the shell metacharacters in the command-line arguments are interpreted by the shell.
    8.  This allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine during a debug session.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution during debugging.
    *   Potential for privilege escalation or host compromise.
    *   Complete host compromise and potential lateral network movement.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Trust in VS Code’s configuration trust model.
    *   Documentation recommends that users employ trusted configurations.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Enhanced runtime validation of debugger configurations.
    *   Usage of safe process-spawning APIs that avoid shell concatenation.
    *   Robust sanitization of file names and command arguments prior to constructing command strings.
    *   Use of a process-spawning API that accepts an array of arguments to avoid shell interpretation.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A workspace is opened with a maliciously crafted `launch.json` configuration.
    *   The user initiates a debugging session using the malicious configuration.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The extension parses the `launch.json` configuration file.
    *   Portions of the configuration content are passed directly to a process launcher without comprehensive sanitization against shell metacharacters.
    *   The extension obtains the language server executable path from the workspace configuration using standard Node APIs and passes this path directly to the process-spawning function without adequate validation.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare a Malicious `launch.json`:**
        *   Create a workspace.
        *   Create a `.vscode` folder and a `launch.json` file inside it.
        *   Embed shell metacharacters (e.g., using `;` or `&&`) in command-line arguments within `launch.json`. For example:
            ```json
            {
                "version": "0.2.0",
                "configurations": [
                    {
                        "name": "Malicious Debug Config",
                        "type": "coreclr",
                        "request": "launch",
                        "program": "/path/to/some/program",
                        "args": ["malicious; calc.exe"]
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```
    2.  **Open Workspace and Start Debugging:**
        *   Open the workspace in VS Code.
        *   Select the "Malicious Debug Config" in the Run and Debug view.
        *   Start a debug session.
    3.  **Verify Command Injection:**
        *   Observe if injected commands (e.g., `calc.exe`) are executed when the debug session starts.

### 4. Command Injection via Unsanitized PipeTransport Configuration in Remote Debug Attach

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized PipeTransport Configuration in Remote Debug Attach
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious `launch.json` configuration file for remote attach debugging.
    2.  This `launch.json` file contains malicious content in `pipeTransport` configuration fields such as `pipeProgram`, `pipeArgs`, and `pipeCwd`.
    3.  The attacker distributes this malicious workspace and convinces a victim to open it in VS Code.
    4.  When the victim initiates a remote attach debug session using this configuration, the extension processes the `launch.json` file.
    5.  The extension concatenates values from `pipeTransport` fields into a single command string without adequate escaping or sanitization.
    6.  Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of `pipeArgs` and `pipeProgram`, the injected commands are executed by the shell on the remote machine.
    7.  The attacker achieves arbitrary command execution on the remote machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution during remote debugging.
    *   Potential for complete host compromise of the remote machine.
    *   Remote System Compromise, Data Breach, and Lateral Movement.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Dependence on the assumption that workspace configurations come from trusted sources.
    *   Minimal quoting applied in some cases.
    *   No mitigations implemented in `RemoteAttachPicker` to prevent command injection based on code analysis.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for `pipeProgram`, `pipeArgs`, and `pipeCwd`.
    *   Use an API that accepts arguments as an array to avoid shell interpretation.
    *   Stricter enforcement to prevent shell metacharacter injection.
    *   Enhanced runtime validation of debugger configurations.
    *   Principle of least privilege for remote attach process.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A remote debugging session is initiated using a workspace with maliciously altered `pipeTransport` fields in `launch.json`.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to influence the `launch.json` configuration, specifically the `pipeTransport.pipeProgram` and `pipeTransport.pipeArgs` settings.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The code in `RemoteAttachPicker` in `/code/src/shared/processPicker.ts` concatenates values of the `pipeTransport` fields into a single command without adequate escaping.
    *   Functions like `createPipeCmdFromString` and `createPipeCmdFromArray` construct command strings by concatenating `pipeProgram` and `pipeArgs` without sanitization.
    *   `getRemoteOSAndProcesses` executes the constructed command via shell using `child_process.exec`.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prepare Malicious `launch.json` with `pipeTransport`:**
        *   Create a `launch.json` configuration with `pipeTransport` fields including injected command payloads, as shown in the example in the "Arbitrary Code Execution via Command Injection in Remote Attach Picker" security test case.
    2.  **Start Remote Debug Attach Session:**
        *   Open the workspace and select the malicious debug configuration.
        *   Start a remote debug attach session.
    3.  **Confirm Command Execution:**
        *   Verify if injected commands execute on the remote machine (e.g., by checking for the creation of a file like `/tmp/pwned.txt`).

### 5. ZIP Slip Vulnerability in Dependency Installer

*   **Vulnerability Name:** ZIP Slip Vulnerability in Dependency Installer
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious ZIP archive for dependency installation.
    2.  This malicious ZIP archive contains entries with directory traversal sequences in their filenames (e.g., "../", "../../").
    3.  The attacker compromises the package update server or intercepts the download to deliver this malicious ZIP archive.
    4.  When the extension downloads and extracts this malicious ZIP archive, the installer computes extraction paths using functions like `path.join` or `path.resolve`.
    5.  Due to the directory traversal sequences in the ZIP entries, the resolved extraction paths point to locations outside the intended installation folder.
    6.  The installer, without proper validation, writes files to these arbitrary locations on the file system.
    7.  This allows the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or compromise of the host.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker may write files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution or compromise of the host.
    *   Complete host compromise.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Integrity verification (e.g., SHA–256 checks) of downloaded packages.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Validation that each ZIP entry’s resolved extraction path is within the approved installation directory.
    *   Rejection of ZIP entries attempting directory traversal.
    *   Input validation and sanitization of ZIP archive entry paths before extraction.
    *   Use of secure archive extraction libraries that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The package update server is compromised (or the download intercepted) to deliver a malicious ZIP archive that passes integrity checks.
    *   The extension attempts to download and install dependencies from a potentially compromised source.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The extraction code uses functions like `path.resolve` or `path.join` to determine absolute paths for extracted files.
    *   The code does not verify that these resolved paths remain within the intended installation directory, allowing path traversal.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Construct a Malicious ZIP Archive:**
        *   Create a ZIP archive with entries using directory traversal sequences in filenames (e.g., "../../malicious.txt").
    2.  **Simulate Dependency Update:**
        *   Configure the extension to download dependencies from a controlled server or local file path where you can serve the malicious ZIP archive.
        *   Simulate a dependency update process in the extension.
    3.  **Verify Extraction Location:**
        *   Check if files from the malicious ZIP archive are extracted outside the designated installation directory (e.g., if `malicious.txt` is created in the root directory or another unexpected location).
        *   Verify that no files are extracted outside the designated directory in a mitigated scenario.

### 6. Cross–Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper HTML Escaping in C# Preview Panel Webview

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Cross–Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper HTML Escaping in C# Preview Panel Webview
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious Razor file containing HTML and JavaScript.
    2.  The attacker convinces a victim to open this malicious Razor file in VS Code and trigger the C# preview panel.
    3.  The C# preview panel webview attempts to render the Razor content as HTML.
    4.  However, the HTML sanitization routine used by the extension improperly escapes HTML characters, specifically failing to consistently escape the ">" character, while attempting to escape "<".
    5.  Due to incomplete HTML escaping, the malicious HTML and JavaScript code from the Razor file are injected into the webview without proper sanitization.
    6.  The webview renders the unsanitized HTML, leading to the execution of the attacker's injected JavaScript code within the webview context.
    7.  This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the webview context, potentially leading to session hijacking or further compromise of extension functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the webview context.
    *   Potential for session hijacking or additional compromise of extension functionality.
    *   Critical impact if webview context has access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   An HTML sanitization routine attempts to replace dangerous characters and wraps output in controlled containers.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   A comprehensive, consistent HTML escaping solution (or use of a trusted library that escapes both “<” and “>”).
    *   Proper and complete HTML escaping of Razor content before rendering in the webview.
    *   Use of a robust and well-vetted HTML sanitization library.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) for the webview to restrict the capabilities of executed scripts.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Untrusted Razor file content is rendered by the preview panel.
    *   The user opens a malicious Razor file and triggers the preview panel.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The routine replaces “<” characters correctly but omits proper handling for “>” due to a duplicated regular expression, leaving the output vulnerable.
    *   The HTML sanitization routine in the extension is flawed and does not completely prevent XSS.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Create a Malicious Razor File:**
        *   Create a Razor file (e.g., `malicious.cshtml`) with carefully crafted HTML/JavaScript to demonstrate XSS. For example:
            ```html
            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">
            ```
    2.  **Open File and Trigger Preview Panel:**
        *   Open the `malicious.cshtml` file in VS Code.
        *   Trigger the C# preview panel (if applicable for Razor files in this extension).
    3.  **Verify Script Execution:**
        *   Check whether the injected JavaScript (`alert('XSS Vulnerability!')`) executes in the preview panel webview.
        *   If the alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.

### 7. Command Injection via Malicious Launch Target File Names in OmniSharp Launcher (Windows)

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Malicious Launch Target File Names in OmniSharp Launcher (Windows)
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker aims to inject commands during the OmniSharp server launch process on Windows.
    2.  The OmniSharp launcher on Windows constructs a command string to launch the OmniSharp server.
    3.  This command string includes workspace-derived solution or project file names as arguments.
    4.  The extension's escape routine for file paths only wraps paths in quotes if spaces are present and inadequately handles shell metacharacters like “&” or “;”.
    5.  An attacker crafts or renames a solution or project file to include shell metacharacters in its name (e.g., "malicious&calc.exe.sln").
    6.  If a user opens a workspace containing such a maliciously named solution/project file, the OmniSharp launcher will use this filename in the command string.
    7.  Due to the inadequate escaping, the shell metacharacters in the filename are interpreted by the Windows command processor when launching OmniSharp.
    8.  This allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands under the user’s privileges during the OmniSharp server launch.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution under the user’s privileges.
    *   Potentially results in complete host compromise.
    *   Complete host compromise and potential lateral network movement.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   A basic escape routine that wraps paths in quotes for spaces.
    *   Reliance on Windows filename restrictions (which are insufficient to prevent all injection).
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Robust sanitization of file names prior to constructing command strings.
    *   Use of a process-spawning API that accepts an array of arguments to avoid shell interpretation.
    *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization of file names to remove or escape shell metacharacters.
    *   Stronger escaping mechanisms beyond just quoting for spaces.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   An attacker is able to introduce or trick the user into opening a workspace with a maliciously named solution/project file.
    *   The vulnerability is specific to Windows platforms.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   The launcher retrieves file names from the workspace and processes them with an inadequate escape mechanism.
    *   The escape routine does not reject dangerous shell metacharacters.
    *   The launcher constructs a command string by concatenating program path and file name arguments without proper sanitization.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Create a Maliciously Named Solution File:**
        *   Create or rename a solution file with shell metacharacters in the name, e.g., "malicious&calc.exe.sln".
    2.  **Open Workspace in VS Code:**
        *   Create a workspace containing this maliciously named solution file.
        *   Open the workspace in VS Code with the C# extension and OmniSharp enabled.
    3.  **Trigger OmniSharp Server Launch:**
        *   Trigger the OmniSharp server launch (e.g., by opening a C# file or performing an action that requires OmniSharp).
    4.  **Verify Command Execution:**
        *   Confirm if an unintended command (such as launching Calculator - `calc.exe`) is executed during the OmniSharp server launch.

### 8. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated Redirect in Package Downloader

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated Redirect in Package Downloader
*   **Description:**
    1.  An attacker compromises the dependency update server or intercepts network traffic.
    2.  When the extension attempts to download a package, the compromised server or intercepted response returns an HTTP 301 or 302 redirect response.
    3.  The `Location` header in the redirect response contains a malicious URL, pointing to an internal IP address or an external target controlled by the attacker.
    4.  The extension's package downloader follows HTTP redirects based solely on the `Location` header value.
    5.  The downloader does not validate the destination URL before following the redirect.
    6.  The extension makes an HTTP request to the malicious URL specified in the `Location` header.
    7.  This allows the attacker to force the extension to make requests to arbitrary internal or external targets, potentially leading to SSRF.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The extension could be tricked into making requests to internal or private network addresses.
    *   Potential for internal network scanning or other attacks.
    *   Exposure of internal services or data.
    *   High impact in scenarios involving sensitive internal networks.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   Strict SSL validation and adherence to proxy settings are in place for initial download requests.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Validation of the target URL before following the redirect.
    *   A whitelist or filtering to prevent redirects to potentially harmful addresses (e.g., private IP ranges, localhost).
    *   Input validation and sanitization of the redirect URL.
    *   Restriction of redirect destinations to trusted domains.
    *   User confirmation before following redirects to different domains or potentially risky destinations.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The dependency update server is compromised (or an attacker intercepts the connection) and supplies a malicious redirect URL.
    *   The extension initiates a package download that is subject to a malicious redirect.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   After receiving an HTTP 301/302 response, the package downloader uses the `Location` header’s value without further validation.
    *   The downloader recursively follows the redirect to the URL specified in the `Location` header, regardless of the target URL.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Configure a Malicious Redirect Server:**
        *   Set up a controlled dependency update server that can return HTTP redirects.
        *   Configure this server to return a 302 redirect to an internal IP address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1`) when a package download is requested.
    2.  **Initiate Package Download:**
        *   Configure the extension to use your controlled server for dependency updates.
        *   Initiate a package download from the extension.
    3.  **Monitor Network Requests:**
        *   Monitor network traffic to see if the extension makes a request to the internal IP address (`127.0.0.1`) after the redirect.
        *   You can use network monitoring tools or server logs to confirm the SSRF attempt.
