## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Vue.js Application (vue-next)

**Objective:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Sub-Tree:**

* Attack: Compromise Vue.js Application (vue-next)
    * OR
        * *** Exploit Template Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH) ***
            * AND
                * **[CRITICAL]** Inject Malicious Code into Templates
                    * *** Via Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection (HIGH RISK PATH) ***
                        * **[CRITICAL]** Unsanitized User Input in SSR Context
        * *** Exploit Component Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH) ***
            * AND
                * **[CRITICAL]** Prop-Based XSS
                    * **[CRITICAL]** Pass Unsanitized User Input as Props to Vulnerable Components

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Template Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Vue.js templates are rendered, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed in the user's browser.

* **Inject Malicious Code into Templates [CRITICAL]:**
    * This critical node represents the core goal of template-based attacks. If an attacker can successfully inject malicious code into the template, they can achieve arbitrary code execution.

* **Via Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This high-risk path specifically targets applications using Server-Side Rendering. If user-provided data is directly embedded into the initial HTML rendered on the server without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

* **Unsanitized User Input in SSR Context [CRITICAL]:**
    * This critical node highlights the root cause of SSR injection vulnerabilities. Failure to sanitize user input before incorporating it into the server-rendered HTML creates a direct injection point.

* **Exploit Component Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within Vue.js components, particularly how they handle and render data passed as props.

* **Prop-Based XSS [CRITICAL]:**
    * This critical node represents a common vulnerability where a component directly renders unsanitized data received as a prop, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

* **Pass Unsanitized User Input as Props to Vulnerable Components [CRITICAL]:**
    * This critical node highlights the action that directly leads to Prop-Based XSS. When user-provided data is passed as a prop to a component without proper sanitization, and the component renders that data without escaping, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
