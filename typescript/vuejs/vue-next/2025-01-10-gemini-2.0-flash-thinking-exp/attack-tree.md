## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_exploitation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the execution of malicious JavaScript within the user's browser.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Template Injection:** Injecting malicious code into Vue.js templates. This occurs when user-controlled data is directly rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization, typically using `v-html` or unescaped mustache syntax `{{ }}`.
    *   **Dynamic Component Loading:** Injecting malicious code by manipulating how components are dynamically loaded. If the application uses user input or external data to determine which component to render, attackers can inject malicious components.

**Critical Nodes within Client-Side Exploitation:**

*   **Exploit Template Injection Vulnerability:** The point at which an attacker leverages the lack of input sanitization in templates to inject malicious code.
*   **Inject Malicious Code into Template Data:** The specific action of inserting malicious scripts or HTML into data that is then rendered by Vue.js templates.
*   **Force Server-Side Rendering of Malicious Content (SSR):**  When an attacker manipulates data or the rendering process so that malicious code is rendered on the server and then executed on the client after hydration.
*   **Abuse Component Lifecycle Hooks:** Exploiting the lifecycle hooks of Vue.js components to execute malicious code.
*   **Inject Malicious Code through Dynamically Loaded Components:**  The direct action of injecting a malicious component that will execute code when it's loaded and mounted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Exploitation (SSR focused)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_exploitation__ssr_focused_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) process to inject malicious code that gets executed either on the server or the client after hydration.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **SSR Template Injection:** Similar to client-side template injection, but the injection occurs during the server-side rendering phase. This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities when the rendered HTML is sent to the client.

**Critical Nodes within Server-Side Exploitation (SSR focused):**

*   **SSR Template Injection:** The point where an attacker injects malicious code into templates rendered on the server.
*   **Inject Malicious Code into Data Rendered During SSR:** The specific action of inserting malicious scripts or HTML into data used during the server-side rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Build/Deployment Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/builddeployment_exploitation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Compromising the application by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced during the build or deployment process.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries (npm packages) that the Vue.js application depends on.

**Critical Nodes within Build/Deployment Exploitation:**

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** The general category of vulnerabilities present in the application's dependencies.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vue.js Dependencies:** The specific action of leveraging a known vulnerability in a dependency to compromise the application.
