# Attack Surface Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Template Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_template_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

**Description:**  A vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into the application's templates and executed in users' browsers.

**How Vue-Next Contributes:** The `v-html` directive allows rendering raw HTML. If user-controlled data is used with `v-html` without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript. While Vue automatically escapes data bindings using `{{ }}`, developers might mistakenly use `v-html` for dynamic content.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Potentially vulnerable if userData.description contains malicious HTML -->
<div v-html="userData.description"></div>
```
If `userData.description` contains `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`, this script will execute.

**Impact:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid using `v-html` for user-provided content.** Prefer text interpolation (`{{ }}`) for automatic escaping.
* If `v-html` is absolutely necessary, **sanitize the data on the server-side or client-side using a trusted HTML sanitization library** (e.g., DOMPurify).
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Directive Abuse (Custom and Third-Party)](./attack_surfaces/directive_abuse__custom_and_third-party_.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities or insecure logic within custom or third-party Vue directives.

**How Vue-Next Contributes:** Vue's directive system allows developers to directly manipulate the DOM. If a custom directive contains insecure logic (e.g., directly setting attributes based on unsanitized user input) or if a vulnerability exists in a third-party directive, it can be exploited.

**Example:**
```javascript
// A potentially vulnerable custom directive
app.directive('unsafe-attribute', {
  mounted(el, binding) {
    el.setAttribute('data-user-input', binding.value); // Directly setting attribute
  }
});
```
If `binding.value` contains malicious content, this could lead to XSS if the attribute is later used in a vulnerable way.

**Impact:**  Can range from DOM manipulation leading to visual issues to more serious vulnerabilities like XSS, depending on the directive's functionality and the attacker's input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly review the code of custom directives** for potential security vulnerabilities, especially when handling user input or external data.
* **Sanitize any user-provided data** before using it within a directive to manipulate the DOM.
* **Carefully evaluate the security of third-party directives** before using them in your application. Check for known vulnerabilities and consider the maintainer's reputation.

## Attack Surface: [Vue Router Vulnerabilities (Open Redirect, Insecure Parameter Handling)](./attack_surfaces/vue_router_vulnerabilities__open_redirect__insecure_parameter_handling_.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the Vue Router handles navigation and route parameters.

**How Vue-Next Contributes:**  Improper configuration or usage of Vue Router can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities if the application allows redirection to arbitrary URLs based on user input. Insecure handling of route parameters can also lead to injection vulnerabilities if these parameters are directly used in API calls or DOM manipulation without sanitization.

**Example (Open Redirect):**
```javascript
// Potentially vulnerable route handling
router.push({ path: `/redirect?to=${userInput}` });
```
If `userInput` is a malicious external URL, the application will redirect the user there.

**Impact:**  Open redirect vulnerabilities can be used for phishing attacks, where users are tricked into visiting malicious sites that appear to be legitimate. Insecure parameter handling can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid redirecting to user-provided URLs directly.** If redirection is necessary, maintain a whitelist of allowed destination URLs and validate user input against this whitelist.
* **Sanitize and validate route parameters** before using them in API calls or DOM manipulation.
* **Use named routes and pass parameters programmatically** instead of relying solely on string concatenation for route construction.

## Attack Surface: [State Management Vulnerabilities (Vuex/Pinia - Improper Access Control)](./attack_surfaces/state_management_vulnerabilities__vuexpinia_-_improper_access_control_.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities related to improper access control or mutation of the global state managed by Vuex or Pinia.

**How Vue-Next Contributes:**  While Vuex and Pinia provide structured ways to manage application state, improper design or implementation can lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if mutations are not properly guarded or if actions allow unauthorized state changes based on user input, the application's state can be compromised.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Potentially vulnerable Vuex mutation (no proper authorization)
mutations: {
  setUserRole(state, payload) {
    state.user.role = payload.role; // Anyone can change the user role
  }
}
```
If an action directly calls this mutation with arbitrary role data from user input, it could lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact:**  Can lead to unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, or inconsistent application state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce strict access control within Vuex/Pinia actions and mutations.** Ensure that only authorized users or components can trigger state changes.
* **Validate data payloads** before committing mutations to the state.
* **Use getters to access state data** and avoid direct modification of the state outside of mutations.
* **Follow the principle of least privilege** when designing state management logic.
