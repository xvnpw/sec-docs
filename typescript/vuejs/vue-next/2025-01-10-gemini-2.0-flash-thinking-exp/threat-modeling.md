# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Threat: [Template Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious script into application data that is then rendered by Vue's template engine without proper sanitization. This script executes in the victim's browser when the component is rendered. This directly involves how `vue-next` compiles and renders templates.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `compiler-core`: The core template compilation module within `vue-next`.
    *   `runtime-dom`: When using features like `v-html` or dynamically rendering components with unsanitized props, which are part of `vue-next`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user-provided data before using it in templates.
    *   Utilize Vue's built-in mechanisms for escaping HTML entities where appropriate.
    *   Avoid using `v-html` with untrusted data. If necessary, use a trusted and well-maintained sanitization library.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Data Binding](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates data binding mechanisms within `vue-next` to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potentially arbitrary code execution if other parts of the application rely on these prototypes.
*   **Impact:**  Application instability, unexpected behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if application logic relies on the integrity of object prototypes. In some scenarios, it could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `reactivity`: Vue's reactivity system within `vue-next`, specifically when handling user-provided data in component options or through `v-model`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly binding user-controlled input to object prototypes.
    *   Be cautious when using third-party libraries that might interact with object prototypes in unexpected ways.
    *   Utilize secure coding practices and avoid directly modifying built-in prototypes.
    *   Keep Vue.js and its dependencies updated, as security patches often address prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Custom Directives](./threats/vulnerable_custom_directives.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom directives, a feature of `vue-next`, that directly manipulate the DOM. If these directives are not implemented securely, they can introduce XSS or DOM clobbering vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  XSS attacks if the directive renders unsanitized user input. DOM clobbering can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues by allowing an attacker to overwrite global variables.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `runtime-core`: The API within `vue-next` for creating and managing custom directives (`app.directive`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and test custom directives for potential security flaws.
    *   Sanitize any user-provided data used within custom directives before manipulating the DOM.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing DOM manipulation logic in directives.
    *   Avoid directly setting `innerHTML` with untrusted data within directives.

## Threat: [XSS During Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Hydration](./threats/xss_during_server-side_rendering__ssr__hydration.md)

*   **Description:** If the server-rendered HTML, generated using `vue-next`'s SSR capabilities, contains unsanitized user input, it can lead to XSS when the client-side Vue application hydrates the DOM. The malicious script is executed during the hydration process, which is a core part of `vue-next`'s SSR implementation.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the user's browser, similar to client-side XSS.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `server-renderer`: The module within `@vue/server-renderer` (part of the Vue ecosystem for SSR) responsible for rendering Vue components on the server.
    *   `runtime-dom`: During the client-side hydration process, which is a feature of `vue-next`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that all user-provided data is properly sanitized or escaped during the server-side rendering process.
    *   Use Vue's built-in mechanisms for escaping HTML entities when rendering data server-side.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Over-Reliance on Client-Side Security](./threats/over-reliance_on_client-side_security.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly rely solely on client-side validation or security measures provided by Vue.js (`vue-next`), neglecting crucial server-side security practices. Attackers can bypass these client-side checks, highlighting a risk related to how developers might use `vue-next`.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing authentication or authorization checks, manipulating data in unintended ways, or gaining unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Components and application logic where security checks are implemented solely on the client-side using `vue-next` features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the bypassed security measures)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always implement robust server-side validation and authorization as the primary line of defense.
    *   Treat client-side security measures as enhancements, not replacements for server-side security.
    *   Never trust user input received from the client.
