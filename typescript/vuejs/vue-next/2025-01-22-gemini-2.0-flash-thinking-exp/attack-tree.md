## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in SSR Applications [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_ssr_applications__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Occurs in Vue-Next applications using Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
    *   Attacker injects malicious code into Vue templates that are rendered on the server.
    *   If user input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, the injected code can be executed on the server.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Identify input fields or URL parameters that are reflected in the server-rendered Vue templates.
    *   Craft malicious payloads containing template syntax or server-side scripting language code (depending on the SSR setup and backend language).
    *   Submit the crafted input, causing the server to execute the malicious code during template rendering.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs before embedding them into server-side templates. Use context-aware output encoding appropriate for the template engine.
    *   **Templating Best Practices:** Avoid directly embedding user input into templates whenever possible. Use data binding and parameterized queries for dynamic content.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to limit the capabilities of executed scripts, reducing the impact of successful SSTI.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting SSR template rendering logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) via Vulnerable Components or Directives [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__client-side_template_injection__csti__via_vulnerable_components_or_directives__high-risk_path_fc065429.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Occurs in client-side rendered Vue-Next applications.
    *   Attacker injects malicious code into Vue templates rendered in the browser.
    *   Often arises from vulnerable custom components or directives that dynamically render user-controlled data into templates without proper escaping.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Identify custom components or directives that render user-provided data directly into templates (e.g., using `v-html` within a component or directive).
    *   Inject malicious HTML, JavaScript, or Vue template syntax through user input fields that are processed by these vulnerable components/directives.
    *   The browser will render the malicious code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Template Rendering with User Input:** Minimize dynamic template rendering with user-controlled data, especially in custom components and directives.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Sanitize user inputs before rendering them in templates. Use Vue's built-in escaping mechanisms like `v-text` or template interpolation (`{{ }}`) for plain text. If `v-html` is absolutely necessary, use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify).
    *   **Code Review for Custom Components/Directives:** Thoroughly review custom components and directives for potential template injection vulnerabilities, paying close attention to how user input is handled.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design components and directives to minimize their exposure to user-controlled data and limit their rendering capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Vue-Next Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_vue-next_plugins__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Vue-Next applications often rely on third-party plugins and libraries from the npm ecosystem.
    *   These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   Attackers target applications using vulnerable versions of these plugins.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Identify the list of Vue-Next plugins and libraries used by the application (e.g., by examining `package.json` or dependency lock files).
    *   Use vulnerability databases (CVE, npm audit, Snyk, etc.) to check for known vulnerabilities in the identified dependencies and their versions.
    *   If vulnerabilities are found, research publicly available exploits or techniques to leverage these vulnerabilities in the context of the Vue-Next application.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning using tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check as part of the development and deployment pipeline.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Vue-Next plugins and libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Automate dependency updates where possible.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for updates on used dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists and use vulnerability monitoring services.
    *   **Dependency Review and Selection:** Carefully review the security posture and maintenance status of plugins before incorporating them into the application. Choose well-maintained and reputable plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying JavaScript Ecosystem Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_javascript_ecosystem_libraries__high-risk_path___cri_ce04bfaa.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Vue-Next and its plugins rely on a broader ecosystem of JavaScript libraries (e.g., for DOM manipulation, utilities, etc.).
    *   Vulnerabilities in these underlying, often transitive, dependencies can indirectly affect Vue-Next applications.
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in these lower-level libraries to compromise applications that depend on them.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Perform deep dependency analysis to identify all direct and transitive dependencies of the Vue-Next application.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to check for known vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries, including transitive dependencies.
    *   If vulnerabilities are found, investigate how they might be exploitable within the context of the Vue-Next application, even if indirectly.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Dependency Scanning:** Scan all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, for vulnerabilities. Tools should be configured to analyze the entire dependency tree.
    *   **Regular Updates of All Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies, including transitive ones, updated to the latest versions. Use dependency management tools that facilitate updating transitive dependencies.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to gain visibility into the entire software bill of materials and manage risks associated with dependencies.
    *   **Monitor JavaScript Ecosystem Security:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities and best practices in the broader JavaScript ecosystem. Follow security blogs, mailing lists, and communities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Rendering User-Controlled Data with `v-html` without Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__rendering_user-controlled_data_with__v-html__without_sanitization__high-risk_path___critical__b14ac7b3.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Developers mistakenly use the `v-html` directive to render user-controlled data directly into the DOM without proper sanitization.
    *   `v-html` renders raw HTML, including any JavaScript code embedded within it.
    *   This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Identify instances in the Vue-Next application where `v-html` is used to render user input.
    *   Inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the user input fields that are rendered using `v-html`.
    *   When the page is rendered, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `v-html` for User Input:**  Never use `v-html` to render user-controlled data directly. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Sanitize User Input (If Absolutely Necessary):** If `v-html` must be used for user-provided content (e.g., rich text editor output), strictly sanitize the input using a robust and actively maintained HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify *before* rendering it with `v-html`. Configure the sanitizer to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes.
    *   **Prefer `v-text` or Template Interpolation:** Use `v-text` or template interpolation (`{{ }}`) for rendering plain text data. These automatically escape HTML entities, preventing XSS.
    *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Conduct code reviews and use static analysis tools to identify and flag instances of `v-html` used with user-controlled data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Storing Sensitive Information Directly in Client-Side State Management [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__storing_sensitive_information_directly_in_client-side_state_management__high-risk_path___crit_dcfcf7fb.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Developers inadvertently store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets, access tokens, private user data) directly in client-side Vuex/Pinia state or component data.
    *   Client-side JavaScript code and state are accessible to attackers through browser developer tools, code inspection, and network interception.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Inspect client-side JavaScript code using browser developer tools (Sources tab).
    *   Examine the Vuex/Pinia state using browser extensions or by directly accessing the store object in the developer console.
    *   Intercept network requests and responses to identify sensitive data being transmitted or stored client-side.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Store Secrets Client-Side:**  Absolutely avoid storing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, secrets, or private user data directly in client-side JavaScript code, Vuex/Pinia state, or local storage.
    *   **Server-Side Configuration and Secrets Management:** Manage sensitive configurations and secrets securely on the server-side. Access them through secure APIs when needed.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage configuration settings, keeping sensitive data out of the codebase and client-side bundles.
    *   **Secure API Design:** Design APIs to minimize the exposure of sensitive data in client-side responses. Only return necessary data and use appropriate authorization and access control mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1. Passing Unvalidated User Input as Props [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1__passing_unvalidated_user_input_as_props__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**
    *   Developers pass user-controlled data directly as props to child components without proper validation or sanitization in the parent component.
    *   If child components are not designed to handle potentially malicious or unexpected data in props, this can lead to vulnerabilities in the child component, such as XSS or logic errors.

*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   Analyze component hierarchies and data flow to identify components that receive user input as props.
    *   Inject malicious data through user input fields that are ultimately passed as props to child components.
    *   Exploit vulnerabilities in child components that arise from improper handling of these malicious props (e.g., template injection in the child component, logic flaws due to unexpected data types).

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate Props in Parent Components:** Always validate and sanitize user-controlled data in the parent component *before* passing it as props to child components. Ensure data conforms to expected types and formats.
    *   **Prop Type Definitions and Validation in Child Components:** Use Vue's prop type definitions and custom validation functions in child components to enforce expected data types and constraints. This provides a second layer of defense.
    *   **Component Isolation and Robustness:** Design child components to be robust and secure even when receiving potentially unexpected or malicious props. Avoid making assumptions about the data received in props.
    *   **Secure Component Design Principles:** Follow secure component design principles, including input validation, output encoding, and minimizing component exposure to untrusted data.
