# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Threat: [Slot Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/slot_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker attempts to inject malicious scripts or HTML code through component slots, aiming to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser (XSS).
    *   **How:** By providing malicious content as slot content, especially if the slot content is dynamically generated or includes user-provided data and is not properly escaped before rendering.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Affected Vue.js Next Component:**
    *   Component `slots` rendering mechanism, specifically when rendering dynamic or user-provided slot content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat slot content as potentially untrusted**, especially if it originates from user input or external sources.
    *   **Utilize Vue's template syntax and directives** which provide automatic HTML escaping by default. Rely on template syntax for rendering dynamic content instead of manual HTML string manipulation.
    *   **Avoid using `v-html` for rendering slot content** if possible.
    *   If rendering dynamic HTML within slots is absolutely necessary, **carefully sanitize and validate the HTML content** before rendering using a trusted HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify.

## Threat: [Component Logic Vulnerabilities due to Composition API Misuse (Severe Cases)](./threats/component_logic_vulnerabilities_due_to_composition_api_misuse__severe_cases_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits severe logic flaws introduced by incorrect usage of the Composition API, leading to significant application vulnerabilities.
    *   **How:** By triggering specific component interactions or providing certain inputs that expose critical flaws in the component's reactive state management, lifecycle hook handling, or closure usage within the `setup()` function, leading to exploitable conditions. This focuses on scenarios where misuse leads to direct security breaches, not just general bugs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, authorization bypass, direct data access or manipulation, or other severe security breaches due to flawed component logic stemming from Composition API misuse.
*   **Affected Vue.js Next Component:**
    *   Component `setup()` function and the Composition API usage within it, specifically in security-sensitive components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough security-focused code review** of components utilizing the Composition API, especially those handling sensitive data or authorization.
    *   **Penetration testing and security audits** targeting component logic to identify potential vulnerabilities arising from Composition API misuse.
    *   **Strict adherence to secure coding practices** and best practices for Composition API usage, with a focus on security implications.
    *   **Comprehensive testing, including security-specific test cases**, to validate component logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Template Injection (XSS) through `v-html`](./threats/template_injection__xss__through__v-html_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious scripts or HTML code by exploiting the use of `v-html` with unsanitized user-provided data.
    *   **How:** By providing malicious HTML content that is then rendered using `v-html` without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker's script to execute in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Affected Vue.js Next Component:**
    *   Template rendering engine, specifically the `v-html` directive.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely avoid using `v-html` whenever possible.**  Rely on Vue's template syntax and directives for safe rendering.
    *   If `v-html` is unavoidable, **always sanitize the HTML content before rendering** using a robust and trusted HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify). Sanitize on the server-side if feasible, or as close to the data source as possible.
    *   **Mandatory security training for developers** emphasizing the critical risks of `v-html` and enforcing secure coding practices with strict code review processes.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** to act as a strong secondary defense layer against XSS, limiting the damage even if `v-html` is misused.

## Threat: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (Severe Cases)](./threats/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__severe_cases_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits critical vulnerabilities in the server-side rendering process to inject malicious code or gain control over the server or client.
    *   **How:**
        *   **Severe SSR Injection:** By providing malicious input that is directly interpolated into the server-rendered HTML without any escaping, leading to server-side code execution or critical XSS.
        *   **Exploiting critical SSR framework vulnerabilities:** Targeting severe, known vulnerabilities in the Vue SSR framework or related server-side libraries that could lead to server compromise or widespread client-side attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Server-Side Injection vulnerabilities potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on the client-side affecting many users, sensitive data exposure, or complete application compromise.
*   **Affected Vue.js Next Component:**
    *   Vue.js SSR framework and related server-side rendering logic, server-side components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and rigorous input sanitization and output encoding** for all user-provided data in the SSR process. Treat all external data as untrusted.
    *   **Implement robust security audits and penetration testing** specifically targeting the SSR implementation and server-side components.
    *   **Follow strict security best practices for SSR implementation** as outlined in official Vue documentation and security guides.
    *   **Keep Vue.js SSR framework and all server-side dependencies up-to-date** with the latest security patches. Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning.
    *   **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to detect and block common SSR injection attempts and other server-side attacks.
