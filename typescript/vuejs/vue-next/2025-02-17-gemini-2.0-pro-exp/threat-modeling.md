# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Third-Party Component](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_third-party_component.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Third-Party Component

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a third-party *Vue 3* component (e.g., a UI library, a plugin). The attacker crafts input or manipulates the application's interaction with the component to trigger the vulnerability, exploiting Vue 3 specific features or reactivity.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely; could range from minor UI glitches to complete application compromise, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or execution of arbitrary code. The impact is directly tied to the vulnerable *Vue 3* component.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any *third-party Vue 3 component* used in the application. This includes UI libraries (Vuetify, Element Plus), and any other custom *Vue 3* components or plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a high-impact vulnerability exists in a widely used component) to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting:** Carefully research and select *Vue 3* components. Prioritize well-maintained components with a strong security track record.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to scan for known vulnerabilities in *Vue 3* dependencies.
        *   **Updates:** Keep all third-party *Vue 3* components updated. Subscribe to security advisories.
        *   **SCA Tools:** Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Isolate *Vue 3* components to limit their access.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection via `v-html`](./threats/client-side_template_injection_via__v-html_.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Template Injection via `v-html`

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious HTML containing JavaScript as input to a part of the application that uses the *Vue 3 `v-html` directive*. Vue 3 renders this content directly into the DOM *without* sanitization, allowing the injected script to execute.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The attacker can steal cookies, redirect the user, deface the application, or perform other actions that JavaScript allows.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component that uses the *Vue 3 `v-html` directive* to render dynamic content, especially from user input or untrusted sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `v-html`:** Prefer template interpolation (`{{ }}`) or the `v-text` directive.
        *   **Sanitization:** If `v-html` is *absolutely necessary*, **always** sanitize the input using a robust library like DOMPurify. *Never* trust user-supplied HTML.
        *   **CSP:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS even if sanitization fails.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Directives (Direct DOM Manipulation)](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_directives__direct_dom_manipulation_.md)

*   **Threat:** Logic Errors in Custom Directives (Direct DOM Manipulation)

    *   **Description:** A developer creates a *custom Vue 3 directive* that manipulates the DOM directly. The directive contains logic errors allowing an attacker to inject malicious content, bypass security, or cause unexpected behavior. This leverages *Vue 3's directive API*.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to XSS vulnerabilities, DOM-based attacks, or application instability. The impact is directly tied to the flawed *Vue 3 custom directive*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any *custom Vue 3 directive* that interacts with the DOM, especially those handling user input. Created using the *`app.directive` API*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize DOM Manipulation:** Avoid direct DOM manipulation in *custom directives* whenever possible. Prefer Vue's declarative rendering.
        *   **Sanitization:** If DOM manipulation is necessary, sanitize user-provided content before inserting it.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate input passed to the *custom directive*.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code of *custom directives*.
        *   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests for *custom directives*.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Reactivity Leading to Data Corruption](./threats/uncontrolled_reactivity_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

*   **Threat:** Uncontrolled Reactivity Leading to Data Corruption

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates *Vue 3's reactive data* in unexpected ways, exploiting logic flaws in how the application handles updates. This could involve triggering excessive updates, causing race conditions, or modifying data to bypass validation. The *Composition API* increases the surface area for these issues.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption within the application state, incorrect calculations, display of wrong information, or application crashes (infinite loops, memory leaks). Could lead to data loss or unauthorized modification if the corrupted state is persisted.
    *   **Affected Component:** *Vue 3's reactivity system (`ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, watchers)*, particularly within components using the *Composition API*. Also affects components using *`provide`/`inject`* for shared state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Data Validation:** Implement robust validation for all modifiable data, especially from user input.
        *   **Immutability:** Treat reactive data as immutable where possible. Use `readonly`.
        *   **Controlled Updates:** Use `watch` and `watchEffect` carefully, with appropriate options. Avoid unnecessary watchers.
        *   **Debouncing/Throttling:** For rapidly triggered events, use debouncing/throttling.
        *   **Unit Testing:** Thoroughly unit test components to ensure correct reactive data updates.
        *   **Vue Devtools:** Use Vue Devtools to inspect the component tree and reactive data.

## Threat: [SSR-Specific XSS Vulnerabilities](./threats/ssr-specific_xss_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** SSR-Specific XSS Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** When using *Vue 3's Server-Side Rendering (SSR)*, an attacker provides malicious input rendered on the server *without* sanitization. This injects JavaScript that executes in the server's context, potentially with higher privileges than client-side XSS. This directly exploits *Vue 3's SSR capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** Server-side XSS, leading to data breaches, server compromise, and arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** The server-side rendering logic, specifically parts handling user input and generating HTML. Often involves *`@vue/server-renderer`* and a templating engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **SSR Library:** Use the official *`@vue/server-renderer`* and follow its security guidelines.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize *all* data rendered on the server, especially from user input.
        *   **Templating Engine:** Choose a templating engine with built-in XSS protection.
        *   **Contextual Escaping:** Escape data appropriately for its rendering context.
        *   **CSP:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the server.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via SSR](./threats/denial_of_service_via_ssr.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via SSR

    *   **Description:** An attacker overloads the server with requests triggering complex *Vue 3 SSR* operations, making the application unavailable. This directly targets *Vue 3's SSR functionality*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Affected Component:** The *server-side rendering logic* and server infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Restrict requests from a single IP or user.
        *   **Caching:** Use caching to reduce the load on the *SSR engine*.
        *   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the *SSR code* to minimize resource consumption.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources and set up alerts.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
