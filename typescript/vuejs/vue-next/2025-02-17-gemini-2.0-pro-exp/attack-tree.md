## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Vue 3 Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_vue_3_application__critical_.md)

**Description:** This is the overarching objective of the attacker. It represents the successful compromise of the application, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.
**Why Critical:** This is the ultimate failure scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on Dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_dependencies__critical_.md)

**Description:** This attack vector involves compromising the application through its dependencies, either by exploiting a known vulnerability in a legitimate dependency or by injecting malicious code during the build process.
**Why Critical:** A successful supply chain attack can give the attacker complete control over the application and potentially access to sensitive data.
**Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependency Introduced [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The application uses a third-party library (directly or transitively) that contains a known vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Dependencies frequently have vulnerabilities.)
        *   **Impact:** High (Can range from minor issues to complete compromise, depending on the vulnerability.)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often straightforward.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Vulnerability scanners are effective.)
    *   **Malicious Code Injection During Build [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the build environment (e.g., build server, CI/CD pipeline) and injects malicious code into the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires compromising a well-protected environment.)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete application compromise.)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Specific to Vue 3)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__specific_to_vue_3_.md)

**Component-Level Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** This refers to vulnerabilities within individual Vue components, often stemming from improper handling of user input or insecure coding practices.  This includes, but is not limited to, traditional web vulnerabilities like XSS manifested within the Vue component context.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common coding errors lead to these vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to XSS, data breaches, and other security issues.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **Avoid `v-html` with Untrusted Data:**
            * **Description:** Using the `v-html` directive with user-supplied data without proper sanitization is a direct path to XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sanitize User Input [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user input before using it in any context (e.g., displaying it, using it in calculations, sending it to the server) can lead to various injection vulnerabilities. This is a general principle, but crucial within Vue components.

*   **3rd-Party Vue 3 Plugins [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within third-party Vue 3 plugins that the application uses.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the plugins used and their security posture.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can range from minor issues to complete compromise, depending on the plugin.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__issues.md)

*   **Vulnerability in Custom SSR Logic [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** If the application implements custom SSR logic (beyond the standard Vue 3 SSR setup), there's a higher risk of introducing vulnerabilities due to coding errors or insecure practices.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the amount and complexity of custom SSR code.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Custom SSR logic often handles sensitive data and server-side operations.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
