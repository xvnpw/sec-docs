# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Rendering with Data Binding and Sanitized `v-html`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_rendering_with_data_binding_and_sanitized__v-html_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Data Binding:** Use Vue's built-in data binding (`{{ }}`) for rendering dynamic content. This automatically escapes HTML entities.
    2.  **Avoid `v-html` if Possible:** If content can be rendered using standard HTML and Vue directives (e.g., `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-bind`), avoid `v-html`.
    3.  **Mandatory Sanitization:** If `v-html` *must* be used, *always* sanitize the input using a robust library like DOMPurify.
        *   Install DOMPurify: `npm install dompurify` or `yarn add dompurify`.
        *   Import DOMPurify: `import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';`
        *   Sanitize: `this.sanitizedHtml = DOMPurify.sanitize(this.untrustedHtml);`
        *   Bind: `<div v-html="sanitizedHtml"></div>`
    4.  **Regularly Review `v-html` Usage:** Code reviews to check all instances of `v-html`.
    5. **Enable Strict Mode for v-html (Vue 3.4+):** If using Vue 3.4 or later, enable the stricter mode for `v-html`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `v-html`:** (Severity: **High**) - Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript.
    *   **DOM Clobbering (with strict v-html):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Attackers can manipulate the DOM structure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via `v-html`:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with sanitization) or Negligible (if avoided).
    *   **DOM Clobbering:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with strict v-html).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Data binding (`{{ }}`) is used extensively (e.g., `UserProfile.vue`, `ProductListing.vue`, `CommentSection.vue`).
    *   DOMPurify is used in `CommentSection.vue` for user comments rendered with `v-html`.
    * Strict mode for `v-html` is enabled globally in `main.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `BlogPost.vue` uses `v-html` *without* sanitization for API-fetched content.  **Critical vulnerability.**
    *   Formalized code review process for `v-html` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dynamic Component Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dynamic_component_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Component Usage:** Find all instances of dynamic component rendering (e.g., `<component :is="...">`).
    2.  **Implement a Whitelist:** Create a whitelist (object or array) of allowed components.
    3.  **Validate Against Whitelist:** Before rendering, check if the component is in the whitelist.
    4.  **Handle Invalid Components:** If not in the whitelist, render a safe component, show an error, or take appropriate action.  *Do not* render the potentially malicious component.
    5.  **Avoid User-Controlled Component Names:** Minimize situations where the component name comes directly from user input.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Component Injection Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Attackers can specify a malicious component to be rendered.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Component Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with whitelist) or Medium (with validation, no whitelist).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Whitelist in `Dashboard.vue` for dynamically rendered widgets (`allowedWidgets` object).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `PluginLoader.vue` dynamically loads components from a configuration file.  A whitelist should be implemented, even if the config file isn't directly user-controlled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigating Prototype Pollution (Vue Reactivity Context)](./mitigation_strategies/mitigating_prototype_pollution__vue_reactivity_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Potential Sources:**  Focus on areas where user data is merged with Vue's reactive objects.  This is where prototype pollution could most likely affect Vue's internal workings.
    2.  **Use Safe Merging Functions:** Avoid recursive merging without checks. Use a safe library or function.
    3.  **Consider `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()`:** For reactive objects that shouldn't be modified after creation, use these to prevent property modification.  *Be mindful of how this interacts with Vue's reactivity system.*  Freezing the *top-level* reactive object might break reactivity; freezing *nested* objects within the reactive data is generally safer.
    4.  **Prefer `Map` for Untrusted Keys:** If keys in a reactive object might come from untrusted sources, use a `Map` instead of a plain object.
    5. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input before using it with reactive objects.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (affecting Vue's reactivity):** (Severity: **Medium to High**) - Could lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or potentially XSS *within the context of Vue's reactivity system*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution:** Risk reduced from Medium/High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Object.freeze()` is used on the *non-reactive* application configuration object (`config.js`).
    *   A custom safe merging function (`safeMerge.js`) is used in `UserSettings.vue`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `dataImport.js` uses a third-party library for merging data.  Audit this library for prototype pollution vulnerabilities.  Consider replacement or safeguards.  This is particularly important if the imported data is then used to update reactive state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Reactivity Practices](./mitigation_strategies/safe_reactivity_practices.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Simplify Computed Properties:** Keep computed properties focused on deriving values. Avoid complex logic that could interact with untrusted data unexpectedly.
    2. **Limit Watcher Side Effects:** Watchers should primarily react to data changes. Avoid modifying external state or performing operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.
    3. **Pure Computed Functions:** Strive for pure functions in computed properties â€“ inputs in, value out, no side effects.
    4. **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test components with reactive properties, especially those interacting with user input, to catch unexpected behavior.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unintentional Data Exposure (through reactivity):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Complex reactivity could expose sensitive data.
    * **Logic Errors Leading to Vulnerabilities (within reactivity):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Errors in computed properties/watchers could create vulnerabilities.

* **Impact:**
    * **Unintentional Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    * **Logic Errors Leading to Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Code reviews emphasize simple computed properties and watchers.
    * Unit tests cover most components with reactive properties.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * More comprehensive integration tests for reactive component interactions with user input.
    * Formal guideline document for writing safe reactive code.
