# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue-next

## Threat: [Logic Vulnerabilities in Composition Functions](./threats/logic_vulnerabilities_in_composition_functions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit flaws in the logic implemented within complex Composition API `setup` functions. This could involve manipulating user input or application flow to bypass security checks, trigger unintended actions, or cause data corruption. For example, an attacker might craft specific input to bypass an authorization check implemented in a composable function, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
*   **Impact:**  Authorization bypass, data manipulation, application malfunction, potential for privilege escalation depending on the nature of the logic vulnerability. This can lead to significant business impact and compromise of sensitive data or system functionality.
*   **Vue-Next Component Affected:** Composition API (`setup` function), Composables, Application Logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous unit and integration testing for all composition functions, especially those handling critical logic, user input validation, and authorization.
    *   Break down complex logic within `setup` functions into smaller, well-defined, and testable composables to improve code maintainability and reduce the likelihood of errors.
    *   Apply secure coding practices within composition functions, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling.
    *   Conduct security-focused code reviews to identify potential logic flaws in composables and `setup` functions.

## Threat: [SSR Hydration Mismatches leading to Client-Side XSS](./threats/ssr_hydration_mismatches_leading_to_client-side_xss.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit inconsistencies between server-rendered HTML and client-side rendered Vue application (hydration mismatches). If attacker-controlled data is involved in these mismatches, it could be manipulated to inject client-side XSS. For example, if server-side rendering incorrectly escapes user input, but client-side hydration does not, or vice versa, XSS could occur when Vue attempts to reconcile the DOM.
*   **Impact:** Client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful XSS can lead to account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and further attacks against users of the application.
*   **Vue-Next Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Hydration process, Template Rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure absolutely consistent rendering logic between server and client environments, paying close attention to data escaping and encoding in both contexts.
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided data on both the server and client sides to prevent injection vulnerabilities.  Use context-aware output encoding.
    *   Implement robust error handling for hydration mismatches and monitor for warnings during development and in production logs. Investigate and fix any hydration warnings immediately.
    *   Adhere strictly to Vue's SSR guidelines and best practices to minimize hydration issues.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to significantly mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if hydration mismatches are exploited.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via SSR Leaks](./threats/information_disclosure_via_ssr_leaks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive server-side data that is inadvertently included in the server-rendered HTML during SSR. This could happen if developers mistakenly embed sensitive data directly into templates or fail to properly control data flow during the SSR process.  This could expose API keys, session tokens, or other confidential information intended only for server-side use.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of highly sensitive server-side data. This can lead to full compromise of backend systems, unauthorized access to APIs, data breaches, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Vue-Next Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Data Handling during SSR.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control and minimize the data passed to SSR rendering functions and templates.  Principle of least privilege for data exposure.
    *   **Never** directly embed sensitive server-side data into Vue templates during SSR.
    *   Implement secure and robust methods for passing data to the client *after* initial hydration, such as fetching data via authenticated API calls after the client-side application has fully loaded and authenticated the user.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews of SSR code paths to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed in the initial HTML.
    *   Perform penetration testing specifically targeting SSR endpoints to identify potential information leaks.

## Threat: [Server-Side Resource Exhaustion due to SSR Misconfiguration/Dependencies](./threats/server-side_resource_exhaustion_due_to_ssr_misconfigurationdependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally cause a denial-of-service by exploiting misconfigurations in the SSR setup or vulnerabilities in server-side dependencies used in the SSR process (Node.js modules). By sending a flood of requests or crafting specific malicious requests, they could overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network) used for SSR, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Server-side Denial of Service (DoS), application unavailability, performance degradation for all users. This can lead to significant business disruption and financial losses.
*   **Vue-Next Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Node.js environment, Server-side Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly and promptly update server-side dependencies, including Node.js and npm/yarn packages, to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
    *   Implement robust resource limits and monitoring for SSR processes to detect and automatically mitigate resource exhaustion attacks. Use tools to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage.
    *   Optimize SSR rendering performance to prevent resource bottlenecks and reduce the impact of potential DoS attempts. Implement caching strategies where appropriate.
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on SSR endpoints to prevent abuse and limit the impact of large request floods.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for Node.js applications to minimize vulnerabilities in server-side code that could be exploited for DoS.
