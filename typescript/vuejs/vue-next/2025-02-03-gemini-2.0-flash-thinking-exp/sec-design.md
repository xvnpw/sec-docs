# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the development and maintenance of Vue.js, an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

## Business Priorities and Goals

- Provide a performant, flexible, and approachable framework for web developers to build user interfaces.
- Maintain a strong and active open-source community around Vue.js.
- Ensure the framework is stable, reliable, and well-documented.
- Continuously improve the framework with new features and optimizations based on community feedback and web development trends.
- Facilitate the creation of secure web applications by providing secure defaults and guidance.
- Promote the adoption of Vue.js within the web development ecosystem.

## Business Risks

- Security vulnerabilities in the Vue.js framework could lead to widespread security issues in applications built with Vue.js, damaging the framework's reputation and user trust.
- Performance regressions or architectural flaws could negatively impact the user experience of applications built with Vue.js, leading to developer dissatisfaction and decreased adoption.
- Breaking changes without proper migration paths could disrupt existing Vue.js projects and frustrate developers.
- Lack of community engagement or insufficient maintenance could lead to stagnation and eventual decline of the framework.
- Competition from other JavaScript frameworks could reduce Vue.js market share and impact its long-term viability.
- Supply chain attacks targeting Vue.js dependencies or build process could compromise the framework and applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

- security control: Code reviews are performed via GitHub Pull Requests before merging code changes. Implemented in: GitHub workflow.
- security control: Issue tracking and vulnerability reporting are managed through GitHub Issues. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.
- security control: Version control using Git and GitHub to track changes and manage codebase history. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Community contributions and public scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: Open Source nature of the project.
- security control: Standard GitHub security features like branch protection and vulnerability scanning (Dependabot). Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.

## Accepted Risks

- accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure is public, which could be exploited before patches are widely adopted.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and reporting security issues, which might have delays or gaps.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Vue.js.

## Recommended Security Controls

- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
- security control: Implement automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including triage, patching, and disclosure.
- security control: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing of the Vue.js framework by external security experts.
- security control: Promote and enforce secure coding practices within the development team and community contributors through documentation and guidelines.
- security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in example applications and documentation to demonstrate and encourage secure application development.
- security control: Consider signing releases and artifacts to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

## Security Requirements

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Vue.js framework itself. Authentication is a concern for applications built using Vue.js. Vue.js should not impose or hinder secure authentication practices in applications.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the Vue.js framework itself. Authorization is a concern for applications built using Vue.js. Vue.js should provide tools and guidance to implement secure authorization in applications.
- Input Validation: Vue.js must provide mechanisms and promote best practices for developers to perform input validation in applications built with Vue.js to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks. Template rendering should escape HTML by default to mitigate XSS.
- Cryptography: Vue.js itself should not implement custom cryptography. If cryptographic operations are needed within the framework (unlikely), it should rely on well-established and secure browser APIs or standard JavaScript libraries. Vue.js should not introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes

- Maintaining the integrity and security of the Vue.js framework codebase.
- Ensuring the availability and reliability of the Vue.js framework for developers.
- Protecting the reputation and trust in the Vue.js project and community.
- Securely building and distributing Vue.js packages to prevent supply chain attacks.

## Data Sensitivity

- Source code of Vue.js: Publicly available, but integrity is critical. Modifications or vulnerabilities injected into the source code would have widespread impact.
- npm package: Publicly available, but integrity is critical. Tampering with the npm package would directly impact developers and applications using Vue.js.
- Developer credentials and secrets used in the build process: Confidential. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or package tampering.
- Vulnerability reports: Confidential until publicly disclosed. Premature disclosure could lead to exploitation.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What level of detail is required for the threat model that will follow this design document? Should we delve deeper into specific components or functionalities?
- Are there any specific security incidents or concerns that are driving this design and threat modeling exercise?
- What is the risk appetite of the Vue.js project and the Vue.js organization regarding security vulnerabilities?
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that the Vue.js project adheres to?

## Assumptions

- The Vue.js project is committed to maintaining a secure and reliable framework.
- Security is considered an important aspect of the Vue.js development lifecycle.
- The Vue.js team is responsive to security vulnerability reports and actively works to address them.
