## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vue-Next Core Features [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_vue-next_core_features__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses attacks that target inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the core functionalities of the Vue-Next framework itself. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Template Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__template_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Template injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controlled data is directly embedded into Vue templates without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious code that is then executed by the template engine.

    *   **1.1.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in SSR Applications [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** In Server-Side Rendering (SSR) applications, templates are rendered on the server. SSTI occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into these server-side templates, leading to code execution on the server itself.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating user input that is directly embedded into server-rendered Vue templates without proper sanitization.
        *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
            *   Strictly sanitize all user inputs before embedding them into server-side templates.
            *   Use parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions to prevent SQL injection (often related to SSTI contexts).
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resource loading, mitigating SSTI impact.

    *   **1.1.2. Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) via Vulnerable Components or Directives [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** CSTI occurs when malicious code is injected into Vue templates rendered client-side, often through vulnerable custom components or directives that improperly handle user input. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting custom components or directives that dynamically render user-controlled data into templates without proper escaping. Injecting malicious HTML, JavaScript, or Vue template syntax.
        *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
            *   Strictly sanitize user inputs when rendering them within templates, especially in custom components and directives. Use Vue's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `v-text` instead of `v-html` when appropriate).
            *   Thoroughly review custom components and directives for potential template injection vulnerabilities during code review.
            *   Avoid unnecessary dynamic template rendering with user-controlled data following the principle of least privilege.

                *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
                    *   Regularly scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check.
                    *   Keep Vue-Next plugins and libraries updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

                    *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
                        *   Regularly update all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, to the latest versions.
                        *   Scan all dependencies, including transitive ones, for vulnerabilities.
                        *   Stay informed about security vulnerabilities and best practices in the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

*   **Description:** This category highlights common mistakes developers make when using Vue-Next that can introduce security vulnerabilities.

    *   **3.1. Improper Use of `v-html` [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** The `v-html` directive renders raw HTML, and if used with user-controlled data without sanitization, it leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

            *   **3.1.1. Rendering User-Controlled Data with `v-html` without Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Description:** Developers mistakenly use `v-html` to render user-controlled data directly into the DOM without proper sanitization, leading to XSS.
                *   **Likelihood:** High
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
                *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying instances where `v-html` is used to render user input. Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the user input.
                *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
                    *   Avoid `v-html` for User Input: Never use `v-html` to render user-controlled data directly.
                    *   Sanitize User Input: If `v-html` is absolutely necessary, strictly sanitize the input using a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) before rendering.
                    *   Prefer `v-text` or Template Interpolation: Use `v-text` or template interpolation (`{{ }}`) for rendering plain text data, as these automatically escape HTML entities and prevent XSS.

    *   **3.2. Exposing Sensitive Data in Client-Side Vuex/Pinia State [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information directly in client-side state management (Vuex/Pinia), making it accessible to attackers.

            *   **3.2.1. Storing Sensitive Information Directly in Client-Side State Management [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets) is stored directly in client-side Vuex/Pinia state, making it accessible to attackers.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High to Critical
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low

                *   **Attack Vector:** Inspecting client-side JavaScript code or browser developer tools to access Vuex/Pinia state and extract sensitive information.
                *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
                    *   Never Store Secrets Client-Side: Avoid storing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or secrets directly in client-side JavaScript code or state management.
                    *   Server-Side Configuration: Manage sensitive configurations and secrets on the server-side and access them through secure APIs.
                    *   Environment Variables: Use environment variables to manage configuration settings, keeping sensitive data out of the codebase.

    *   **3.3. Insecure Component Communication (Props/Events) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:**  Insecure practices in component communication, specifically with props, can introduce vulnerabilities.

                *   **Description:** User-controlled data is passed directly as props to child components without proper validation or sanitization, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in child components.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium

                *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying component hierarchies where user input is passed as props. Injecting malicious data through props to exploit vulnerabilities in child components.
                *   **Actionable Mitigation:**
                    *   Validate Props: Always validate and sanitize props received by components, especially when they originate from user input.
                    *   Prop Type Definitions: Use Vue's prop type definitions to enforce expected data types and improve component security.
                    *   Component Isolation: Design components to be robust and secure even when receiving potentially malicious props.
