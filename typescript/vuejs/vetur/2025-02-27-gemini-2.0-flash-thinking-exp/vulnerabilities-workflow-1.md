## Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Grammar Injection in Custom Block Handling

* Vulnerability Name: Grammar Injection in Custom Block Handling
* Description:
    1. The Vetur extension allows users to define custom blocks in Vue Single-File Components through the `vetur.grammar.customBlocks` setting.
    2. This setting is used by the `generateGrammarCommandHandler` to dynamically generate a grammar file (`vue-generated.json`) that extends the base Vue grammar for syntax highlighting.
    3. The `getGeneratedGrammar` function in `grammar.ts` takes the user-provided `customBlocks` and directly injects the tag and scope values into a JSON string template within the `makePattern` function.
    4. If a malicious user provides crafted `tag` or `lang` values in `vetur.grammar.customBlocks`, they can inject arbitrary JSON code into the generated `vue-generated.json` file.
    5. This injected JSON can alter the syntax highlighting rules of the Vue language in VSCode.
* Impact:
    - Malicious syntax highlighting in Vue files, potentially misleading developers about the structure and meaning of their code.
    - In extreme cases, carefully crafted injected grammar rules might be able to exploit vulnerabilities in VSCode's textmate grammar engine or other extensions that rely on syntax highlighting, although this is less likely.
    - Reduced code readability and developer trust in the editor's syntax highlighting.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly injects user-provided values into the grammar JSON string without sanitization or validation beyond a basic check for valid scope names.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `tag` and `lang` values in `vetur.grammar.customBlocks` to prevent JSON injection.
    - Validation of `lang` values against a whitelist of allowed language scopes to ensure only valid scopes are used in the grammar.
    - Consider using a safer method for generating JSON dynamically instead of string templating and `JSON.parse`, which can be prone to injection issues.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the VSCode user settings or workspace settings to set a malicious `vetur.grammar.customBlocks` value. This can be achieved if the attacker can convince a developer to open a workspace with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` or through other configuration manipulation techniques.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/client/grammar.ts`**
    ```typescript
    function makePattern(tag: string, scope: string) {
      return JSON.parse(`
      {
        "begin": "(<)(${tag})",
        ...
        "end": "(</)(${tag})(>)",
        ...
        "patterns": [
            ...
            {
                "begin": "(>)",
                ...
                "end": "(?=</${tag}>)",
                "contentName": "${scope}",
                "patterns": [
                    {
                        "include": "${scope}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
      }
      `);
    }
    ```
    - The `makePattern` function uses template literals to construct a JSON object as a string.
    - User-controlled `tag` and `scope` parameters are directly embedded into this string.
    - `JSON.parse` is then used to convert this string into a JavaScript object, which becomes part of the generated grammar.
    - No sanitization is performed on `tag` or `scope` before injection.

    2. **File: `/code/client/generateGrammarCommand.ts`**
    ```typescript
    export function generateGrammarCommandHandler(extensionPath: string) {
      return () => {
        try {
          const customBlocks: { [k: string]: string } =
            vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get('vetur.grammar.customBlocks') || {};
          const generatedGrammar = getGeneratedGrammar(
            resolve(extensionPath, 'syntaxes/vue.tmLanguage.json'),
            customBlocks
          );
          writeFileSync(resolve(extensionPath, 'syntaxes/vue-generated.json'), generatedGrammar, 'utf-8');
          vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Successfully generated vue grammar. Reload VS Code to enable it.');
        } catch (e) {
          console.error((e as Error).stack);
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
            'Failed to generate vue grammar. \`vetur.grammar.customBlocks\` contain invalid language values'
          );
        }
      };
    }
    ```
    - The `generateGrammarCommandHandler` retrieves the `vetur.grammar.customBlocks` configuration directly from VSCode.
    - It passes this configuration to `getGeneratedGrammar` without any validation.

    3. **File: `/code/client/grammar.ts`**
    ```typescript
    export function getGeneratedGrammar(grammarPath: string, customBlocks: { [k: string }: string }): string {
      const grammar = JSON.parse(readFileSync(grammarPath, 'utf-8'));
      for (const tag in customBlocks) {
        const lang = customBlocks[tag];
        if (!SCOPES[lang]) {
          throw \`The language for custom block <\${tag}> is invalid\`;
        }

        grammar.patterns.unshift(makePattern(tag, SCOPES[lang]));
      }
      return JSON.stringify(grammar, null, 2);
    }
    ```
    - The `getGeneratedGrammar` function iterates through the `customBlocks`.
    - It performs a check to ensure the `lang` value exists in the `SCOPES` object. This mitigates invalid `lang` values but does not prevent JSON injection via `tag` or malicious `lang` values that are still within `SCOPES`.
    - For each custom block, it calls `makePattern` with the `tag` and the corresponding `scope` from `SCOPES`.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - VSCode with the Vetur extension installed.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
        - Navigate to "Extensions" -> "Vetur" -> "Vetur > Grammar > Custom Blocks".
        - Click "Edit in settings.json".
        - Add the following malicious configuration to your `settings.json` (either user or workspace settings):
        ```json
        "vetur.grammar.customBlocks": {
            "maliciousBlock": "source.js",
            "';恶意代码注入':": "source.js"
        }
        ```
        - Save the `settings.json` file.
        - Execute the "Vetur: Generate Grammar" command from the VSCode command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
        - Reload VSCode (Command Palette -> "Developer: Reload Window").
        - Open or create a `.vue` file.
        - Observe the syntax highlighting, especially within `<maliciousBlock>` and `<';恶意代码注入':>` tags.
        - Inspect the generated grammar file `vue-generated.json` located in the `syntaxes` folder of the Vetur extension directory to confirm the injected JSON structure (you might need to find the extension directory first, usually in `~/.vscode/extensions` or similar). Look for the injected tag names and potentially altered grammar patterns.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The `vue-generated.json` file will contain injected JSON structures based on the malicious `tag` and potentially `lang` values.
        - Syntax highlighting in Vue files might be broken or altered, especially within custom blocks named with malicious tags.
        - In the example above, you might see a custom block named `';恶意代码注入':` being highlighted as JavaScript due to the `source.js` scope, and the tag name itself might contain invalid characters causing parsing issues or unexpected highlighting behavior.

### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted vetur.config.js

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted vetur.config.js
* Description:
  The extension automatically loads a workspace configuration file (e.g. “vetur.config.js” or “vetur.config.cjs”) via Node’s native require() without sandboxing. If an attacker commits a malicious configuration file into the repository, code in that file will be executed in the extension’s process.
* Impact:
  Full remote code execution (RCE) is possible within the VSCode extension process. An attacker can manipulate the file system, execute arbitrary commands, or exfiltrate data.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The extension presumes that the workspace is trusted.
  - No sandboxing or runtime validation is performed prior to requiring the configuration file.
* Missing Mitigations:
  - No sandboxed evaluation of configuration files.
  - No integrity or signature verification of the configuration file before execution.
* Preconditions:
  - The user opens a workspace containing a malicious “vetur.config.js” (or “vetur.config.cjs”).
  - The extension automatically loads this file on startup.
* Source Code Analysis:
  - The workspace initialization code directly uses Node’s require() to load the configuration file without an isolated execution context.
* Security Test Case:
  1. Create a test workspace that includes a “vetur.config.js” file carrying a payload (for example, writing a file or sending a network request).
  2. Open this workspace in VSCode with this extension installed.
  3. Verify that the payload executes (e.g., check that the file is created or the network request is made).

### Vulnerability: Insecure Module Loading from Workspace Dependencies

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure Module Loading from Workspace Dependencies
* Description:
  When the “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies” setting is enabled, the extension loads runtime modules (such as TypeScript or Prettier) from the workspace’s node_modules folder. If an attacker controls the repository, they can include a tampered version of one of these modules that, when required, can execute malicious code.
* Impact:
  Arbitrary code execution within the language service process is possible. This may lead to file modifications, injection of additional malicious payloads, or data leakage.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies” is disabled by default so that the extension uses bundled dependencies in standard configurations.
* Missing Mitigations:
  - No integrity, signature, or hash verification is performed on workspace modules.
  - No sandboxing or explicit warnings when the option is enabled manually.
* Preconditions:
  - The user enables “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies”.
  - The workspace contains a tampered version of a critical dependency (e.g. in node_modules).
* Source Code Analysis:
  - The dependency service dynamically requires modules from the workspace’s node_modules folder without additional validation or isolation.
* Security Test Case:
  1. In a controlled workspace, enable “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies”.
  2. Replace a trusted module (for example, TypeScript) in node_modules with a malicious version that performs an observable action.
  3. Open the workspace and trigger a feature that loads the module.
  4. Observe that the malicious payload executes.

### Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Global Components Globs

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Global Components Globs
* Description:
  The extension allows users to specify “globalComponents” via glob patterns in the configuration. An attacker (or an untrusted repository) can supply glob patterns with upward directory traversal (e.g. “../”) that cause the extension to read files outside the workspace.
* Impact:
  Sensitive files outside the workspace may be exposed (including system files, configuration files, or credentials), leading to further exploitation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - File path normalization (using functions like path.resolve) is applied.
* Missing Mitigations:
  - No explicit check is enforced to ensure that glob patterns remain within the workspace boundaries.
  - No sandboxing or whitelisting of allowed directories for glob resolution.
* Preconditions:
  - The workspace’s configuration (via vetur.config.js or package.json) specifies malicious glob patterns that traverse upward from the workspace folder.
* Source Code Analysis:
  - In the global components handling code, glob patterns from configuration are passed directly to file system operations without verification that the resolved paths lie within a trusted directory.
* Security Test Case:
  1. In a test workspace, configure “globalComponents” with a glob pattern that traverses outside the workspace (e.g. “../secret/**/*.conf”).
  2. Ensure dummy sensitive files exist outside the workspace that match the glob.
  3. Open the workspace in VSCode and trigger global component processing.
  4. Verify that the extension reads files outside the intended workspace.

### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Yarn PnP Files

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Yarn PnP Files
* Description:
  In Yarn Plug’n’Play (PnP) environments, the extension detects the presence of “.pnp.js” or “.pnp.cjs” in the workspace and directly requires and executes them (by calling their setup() method). Malicious Yarn PnP files committed into the repository can cause arbitrary code execution.
* Impact:
  Full remote code execution (RCE) is possible within the VSCode extension process. An attacker could modify local files, trigger further attacks, or exfiltrate data.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The extension simply checks for the presence of “.pnp.js”/“.pnp.cjs” and requires them without performing sandboxing or verification.
* Missing Mitigations:
  - No sandboxed evaluation or integrity check (such as cryptographic signature verification) is performed before executing Yarn PnP files.
  - No user notification or confirmation is requested before execution.
* Preconditions:
  - The workspace contains a malicious Yarn PnP file (".pnp.js" or ".pnp.cjs").
  - Yarn PnP support is enabled (by default or via configuration).
* Source Code Analysis:
  - During workspace registration, the extension checks for a Yarn PnP file and uses a plain require() call—without isolation—to call its setup() method.
* Security Test Case:
  1. In a controlled test workspace, place a malicious “.pnp.js” file that carries a payload (for example, writing to disk or sending a network request) in its setup() function.
  2. Open the workspace in VSCode with the extension installed.
  3. Verify that the payload is executed.

### Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Vetur Tag Provider Configuration

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Vetur Tag Provider Configuration
* Description:
  The extension supports loading additional tag provider configurations from file paths specified (for tags and attributes) in package.json under a “vetur” property. These file paths are resolved and read without strict sanitization. An attacker could craft these paths to point to arbitrary files on the system.
* Impact:
  Sensitive files (such as configuration files or credentials) may be inadvertently read by the extension and disclosed, potentially facilitating further exploitation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - File paths are normalized (using functions such as findConfigFile and path.resolve).
* Missing Mitigations:
  - No check is performed to ensure that the resolved paths lie within an approved (trusted) directory.
  - No user confirmation or sandboxing is applied prior to reading tag provider files.
* Preconditions:
  - A package.json or workspace configuration includes a “vetur” property with file paths that use directory traversal or otherwise point outside of trusted folders.
* Source Code Analysis:
  - The external tag provider module reads files using fs.readFileSync and JSON.parse on file paths resolved from the configuration, without validating that these file paths do not escape the intended workspace boundaries.
* Security Test Case:
  1. In a test workspace, modify package.json so that the “vetur” property contains tag provider file paths that point outside of the workspace (for example, “../secret/tags.json”).
  2. Place a dummy sensitive file outside the workspace that matches the specified path.
  3. Open the workspace in VSCode and trigger tag provider processing (for example, by opening a Vue file).
  4. Confirm that the external file is read and its content is processed by the extension.

### Vulnerability: Path Traversal in VTI Diagnostics Command

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in VTI Diagnostics Command
* Description:
    1. An attacker can execute the `vti diagnostics` command.
    2. The `vti diagnostics` command accepts `workspace` and `paths` arguments to specify the target files for diagnostics. The `workspace` argument defines the workspace directory, and `paths` specifies files or directories within the workspace to analyze.
    3. By crafting malicious `paths` arguments containing path traversal sequences like `..`, an attacker can attempt to make VTI access files outside of the intended workspace directory, especially if the `workspace` argument is not strictly validated and controlled.
    4. If VTI processes these paths without proper validation, it may access and potentially disclose the content of arbitrary files on the file system.
* Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker could read sensitive files from the server's file system if VTI outputs file contents or error messages that reveal file paths or contents.
    - Arbitrary File Read: In a worst-case scenario, depending on how VTI handles file access and errors, it might be possible to read the content of any file accessible to the VTI process under the user's account running VTI.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided files. The code uses `path.resolve` which resolves paths, but it does not prevent path traversal if the base path itself is not validated or restricted.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation for the `workspace` and `paths` arguments in the `vti diagnostics` command to prevent path traversal.
        - For `workspace`, ensure it resolves to a valid workspace directory and is not an arbitrary path controlled by the attacker. Consider validating against a list of allowed workspace directories or using a secure method to define the workspace root.
        - For `paths`, sanitize and normalize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences like `..` before using them to access files. Verify that resolved paths are within the intended workspace directory.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize and normalize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences before using them to access files. Use functions that resolve paths securely within a defined base directory, preventing escape to parent directories.
    - Workspace restriction: Implement checks to ensure that VTI only accesses files within the intended workspace directory and prevent access to files outside of it. After resolving paths, verify that the resolved absolute path is a subdirectory of the allowed workspace path.
* Preconditions:
    - VTI must be installed and accessible to the attacker, or the attacker can influence the execution of VTI (e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline).
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the `vti diagnostics` command, specifically the `paths` argument, and potentially the `workspace` argument if its validation is weak.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - In `vti/src/commands/diagnostics.ts`:
        ```typescript
        import path from 'path';
        import fs from 'fs';
        import { URI } from 'vscode-uri';
        import glob from 'glob';

        export async function diagnostics(workspace: string | null, paths: string[], logLevel: LogLevel) {
          let workspaceUri;

          if (workspace) {
            const absPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), workspace); // [1] Workspace path resolution
            workspaceUri = URI.file(absPath);
          } else {
            workspaceUri = URI.file(process.cwd());
          }

          let files: string[];
          if (paths.length === 0) {
            files = glob.sync('**/*.vue', { cwd: workspaceUri.fsPath, ignore: ['node_modules/**'] }); // [2] Glob from workspace
          } else {
            const listOfPaths = paths.map(inputPath => {
              const absPath = path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, inputPath); // [3] Path resolution for input paths
              if (fs.lstatSync(absPath).isFile()) { // [4] File existence check
                return [inputPath];
              }

              const directory = URI.file(absPath);
              const directoryFiles = glob.sync('**/*.vue', { cwd: directory.fsPath, ignore: ['node_modules/**'] }); // [5] Glob from input path directory
              return directoryFiles.map(f => path.join(inputPath, f));
            });
            files = listOfPaths.reduce((acc: string[], paths) => [...acc, ...paths], []);
          }

          const absFilePaths = files.map(f => path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, f)); // [6] Final file paths resolution

          for (const absFilePath of absFilePaths) {
            const fileText = fs.readFileSync(absFilePath, 'utf-8'); // [7] File reading
            // ... diagnostics processing ...
          }
        }
        ```
        - [1] The `workspace` argument is resolved using `path.resolve(process.cwd(), workspace)`. If the `workspace` argument starts with `/`, it will be treated as an absolute path. Otherwise, it's relative to the current working directory. There is no explicit validation to restrict the `workspace` path to a specific allowed directory.
        - [3] For each path in the `paths` argument, `path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, inputPath)` is used. This resolves `inputPath` relative to the resolved `workspaceUri.fsPath`. While `path.resolve` is used, it does not inherently prevent path traversal if `inputPath` contains `..` sequences.
        - [4] `fs.lstatSync(absPath).isFile()` checks if the resolved path is a file. This check occurs *after* path resolution, and does not prevent path traversal from happening during the resolution step.
        - [7] `fs.readFileSync(absFilePath, 'utf-8')` reads the file at the resolved absolute path. If path traversal is successful, this could read files outside the intended workspace.
        - There is no explicit validation to ensure that the resolved file paths in `absFilePaths` are within the intended `workspaceUri.fsPath`.
        - Visualization:
        ```
        Attacker Controlled Input: workspace = "../../", paths = ["../../../sensitive_file.txt"]
        process.cwd(): /home/user/project
        workspace argument: "../../"
        [1] absPath (workspace path): path.resolve(/home/user/project, "../../") -> /home/user
        workspaceUri.fsPath: /home/user
        inputPath (paths argument): "../../../sensitive_file.txt"
        [3] absPath (input file path): path.resolve(/home/user, "../../../sensitive_file.txt") -> /sensitive_file.txt (Path Traversal!)
        [7] fs.readFileSync(/sensitive_file.txt) -> Sensitive file content is read if permissions allow.
        ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a local Vue project and install VTI globally using `npm install -g vti`.
    2. Create a sensitive file outside the Vue project directory, for example, create a file named `sensitive_data.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\temp\` (on Windows) with some sensitive content like "This is sensitive information.".
    3. Open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to simulate a workspace (this directory can be empty or contain a Vue project, the vulnerability is independent of project content).
    4. Execute the VTI diagnostics command, attempting path traversal by setting the `workspace` argument to traverse up from the current directory and then providing a path to the sensitive file in the `paths` argument. For example:
        - On Linux/macOS: `vti diagnostics --workspace ../../ --paths ../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt`
        - On Windows: `vti diagnostics --workspace ..\..\ --paths ..\..\..\temp\sensitive_data.txt`
        - Alternatively, if workspace is not easily controlled, try path traversal directly in paths: `vti diagnostics --paths ../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt`
    5. Analyze the output of the command.
        - If VTI outputs the content of `sensitive_data.txt` or an error message that reveals the content or path of the sensitive file, it indicates a successful path traversal and the presence of the vulnerability.
        - If VTI reports an error indicating that the file is outside the workspace or access is denied, it suggests that some mitigation might be in place, or the vulnerability is not exploitable in this way for this specific path. However, further testing with different traversal depths and paths might still be needed to confirm full mitigation.
    6. If the vulnerability is confirmed, implement missing mitigations like input validation and path sanitization in `vti/src/commands/diagnostics.ts` to prevent path traversal.
