- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted vetur.config.js  
  **Description:**  
  The extension automatically loads a workspace configuration file (e.g. “vetur.config.js” or “vetur.config.cjs”) via Node’s native require() without sandboxing. If an attacker commits a malicious configuration file into the repository, code in that file will be executed in the extension’s process.  
  **Impact:**  
  Full remote code execution (RCE) is possible within the VSCode extension process. An attacker can manipulate the file system, execute arbitrary commands, or exfiltrate data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension presumes that the workspace is trusted.  
  - No sandboxing or runtime validation is performed prior to requiring the configuration file.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No sandboxed evaluation of configuration files.  
  - No integrity or signature verification of the configuration file before execution.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user opens a workspace containing a malicious “vetur.config.js” (or “vetur.config.cjs”).  
  - The extension automatically loads this file on startup.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The workspace initialization code directly uses Node’s require() to load the configuration file without an isolated execution context.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create a test workspace that includes a “vetur.config.js” file carrying a payload (for example, writing a file or sending a network request).  
  2. Open this workspace in VSCode with this extension installed.  
  3. Verify that the payload executes (e.g., check that the file is created or the network request is made).

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Module Loading from Workspace Dependencies  
  **Description:**  
  When the “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies” setting is enabled, the extension loads runtime modules (such as TypeScript or Prettier) from the workspace’s node_modules folder. If an attacker controls the repository, they can include a tampered version of one of these modules that, when required, can execute malicious code.  
  **Impact:**  
  Arbitrary code execution within the language service process is possible. This may lead to file modifications, injection of additional malicious payloads, or data leakage.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies” is disabled by default so that the extension uses bundled dependencies in standard configurations.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No integrity, signature, or hash verification is performed on workspace modules.  
  - No sandboxing or explicit warnings when the option is enabled manually.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user enables “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies”.  
  - The workspace contains a tampered version of a critical dependency (e.g. in node_modules).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The dependency service dynamically requires modules from the workspace’s node_modules folder without additional validation or isolation.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a controlled workspace, enable “vetur.useWorkspaceDependencies”.  
  2. Replace a trusted module (for example, TypeScript) in node_modules with a malicious version that performs an observable action.  
  3. Open the workspace and trigger a feature that loads the module.  
  4. Observe that the malicious payload executes.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Global Components Globs  
  **Description:**  
  The extension allows users to specify “globalComponents” via glob patterns in the configuration. An attacker (or an untrusted repository) can supply glob patterns with upward directory traversal (e.g. “../”) that cause the extension to read files outside the workspace.  
  **Impact:**  
  Sensitive files outside the workspace may be exposed (including system files, configuration files, or credentials), leading to further exploitation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - File path normalization (using functions like path.resolve) is applied.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No explicit check is enforced to ensure that glob patterns remain within the workspace boundaries.  
  - No sandboxing or whitelisting of allowed directories for glob resolution.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The workspace’s configuration (via vetur.config.js or package.json) specifies malicious glob patterns that traverse upward from the workspace folder.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the global components handling code, glob patterns from configuration are passed directly to file system operations without verification that the resolved paths lie within a trusted directory.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test workspace, configure “globalComponents” with a glob pattern that traverses outside the workspace (e.g. “../secret/**/*.conf”).  
  2. Ensure dummy sensitive files exist outside the workspace that match the glob.  
  3. Open the workspace in VSCode and trigger global component processing.  
  4. Verify that the extension reads files outside the intended workspace.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Yarn PnP Files  
  **Description:**  
  In Yarn Plug’n’Play (PnP) environments, the extension detects the presence of “.pnp.js” or “.pnp.cjs” in the workspace and directly requires and executes them (by calling their setup() method). Malicious Yarn PnP files committed into the repository can cause arbitrary code execution.  
  **Impact:**  
  Full remote code execution (RCE) is possible within the VSCode extension process. An attacker could modify local files, trigger further attacks, or exfiltrate data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension simply checks for the presence of “.pnp.js”/“.pnp.cjs” and requires them without performing sandboxing or verification.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No sandboxed evaluation or integrity check (such as cryptographic signature verification) is performed before executing Yarn PnP files.  
  - No user notification or confirmation is requested before execution.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The workspace contains a malicious Yarn PnP file (".pnp.js" or ".pnp.cjs").  
  - Yarn PnP support is enabled (by default or via configuration).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - During workspace registration, the extension checks for a Yarn PnP file and uses a plain require() call—without isolation—to call its setup() method.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a controlled test workspace, place a malicious “.pnp.js” file that carries a payload (for example, writing to disk or sending a network request) in its setup() function.  
  2. Open the workspace in VSCode with the extension installed.  
  3. Verify that the payload is executed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Malicious Vetur Tag Provider Configuration  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports loading additional tag provider configurations from file paths specified (for tags and attributes) in package.json under a “vetur” property. These file paths are resolved and read without strict sanitization. An attacker could craft these paths to point to arbitrary files on the system.  
  **Impact:**  
  Sensitive files (such as configuration files or credentials) may be inadvertently read by the extension and disclosed, potentially facilitating further exploitation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - File paths are normalized (using functions such as findConfigFile and path.resolve).  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No check is performed to ensure that the resolved paths lie within an approved (trusted) directory.  
  - No user confirmation or sandboxing is applied prior to reading tag provider files.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - A package.json or workspace configuration includes a “vetur” property with file paths that use directory traversal or otherwise point outside of trusted folders.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The external tag provider module reads files using fs.readFileSync and JSON.parse on file paths resolved from the configuration, without validating that these file paths do not escape the intended workspace boundaries.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test workspace, modify package.json so that the “vetur” property contains tag provider file paths that point outside of the workspace (for example, “../secret/tags.json”).  
  2. Place a dummy sensitive file outside the workspace that matches the specified path.  
  3. Open the workspace in VSCode and trigger tag provider processing (for example, by opening a Vue file).  
  4. Confirm that the external file is read and its content is processed by the extension.
