### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in VTI Diagnostics Command
- Description:
    1. An attacker can execute the `vti diagnostics` command.
    2. The `vti diagnostics` command accepts `workspace` and `paths` arguments to specify the target files for diagnostics. The `workspace` argument defines the workspace directory, and `paths` specifies files or directories within the workspace to analyze.
    3. By crafting malicious `paths` arguments containing path traversal sequences like `..`, an attacker can attempt to make VTI access files outside of the intended workspace directory, especially if the `workspace` argument is not strictly validated and controlled.
    4. If VTI processes these paths without proper validation, it may access and potentially disclose the content of arbitrary files on the file system.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker could read sensitive files from the server's file system if VTI outputs file contents or error messages that reveal file paths or contents.
    - Arbitrary File Read: In a worst-case scenario, depending on how VTI handles file access and errors, it might be possible to read the content of any file accessible to the VTI process under the user's account running VTI.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided files. The code uses `path.resolve` which resolves paths, but it does not prevent path traversal if the base path itself is not validated or restricted.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement strict validation for the `workspace` and `paths` arguments in the `vti diagnostics` command to prevent path traversal.
        - For `workspace`, ensure it resolves to a valid workspace directory and is not an arbitrary path controlled by the attacker. Consider validating against a list of allowed workspace directories or using a secure method to define the workspace root.
        - For `paths`, sanitize and normalize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences like `..` before using them to access files. Verify that resolved paths are within the intended workspace directory.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize and normalize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences before using them to access files. Use functions that resolve paths securely within a defined base directory, preventing escape to parent directories.
    - Workspace restriction: Implement checks to ensure that VTI only accesses files within the intended workspace directory and prevent access to files outside of it. After resolving paths, verify that the resolved absolute path is a subdirectory of the allowed workspace path.
- Preconditions:
    - VTI must be installed and accessible to the attacker, or the attacker can influence the execution of VTI (e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline).
    - The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the `vti diagnostics` command, specifically the `paths` argument, and potentially the `workspace` argument if its validation is weak.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `vti/src/commands/diagnostics.ts`:
        ```typescript
        import path from 'path';
        import fs from 'fs';
        import { URI } from 'vscode-uri';
        import glob from 'glob';

        export async function diagnostics(workspace: string | null, paths: string[], logLevel: LogLevel) {
          let workspaceUri;

          if (workspace) {
            const absPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), workspace); // [1] Workspace path resolution
            workspaceUri = URI.file(absPath);
          } else {
            workspaceUri = URI.file(process.cwd());
          }

          let files: string[];
          if (paths.length === 0) {
            files = glob.sync('**/*.vue', { cwd: workspaceUri.fsPath, ignore: ['node_modules/**'] }); // [2] Glob from workspace
          } else {
            const listOfPaths = paths.map(inputPath => {
              const absPath = path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, inputPath); // [3] Path resolution for input paths
              if (fs.lstatSync(absPath).isFile()) { // [4] File existence check
                return [inputPath];
              }

              const directory = URI.file(absPath);
              const directoryFiles = glob.sync('**/*.vue', { cwd: directory.fsPath, ignore: ['node_modules/**'] }); // [5] Glob from input path directory
              return directoryFiles.map(f => path.join(inputPath, f));
            });
            files = listOfPaths.reduce((acc: string[], paths) => [...acc, ...paths], []);
          }

          const absFilePaths = files.map(f => path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, f)); // [6] Final file paths resolution

          for (const absFilePath of absFilePaths) {
            const fileText = fs.readFileSync(absFilePath, 'utf-8'); // [7] File reading
            // ... diagnostics processing ...
          }
        }
        ```
        - [1] The `workspace` argument is resolved using `path.resolve(process.cwd(), workspace)`. If the `workspace` argument starts with `/`, it will be treated as an absolute path. Otherwise, it's relative to the current working directory. There is no explicit validation to restrict the `workspace` path to a specific allowed directory.
        - [3] For each path in the `paths` argument, `path.resolve(workspaceUri.fsPath, inputPath)` is used. This resolves `inputPath` relative to the resolved `workspaceUri.fsPath`. While `path.resolve` is used, it does not inherently prevent path traversal if `inputPath` contains `..` sequences.
        - [4] `fs.lstatSync(absPath).isFile()` checks if the resolved path is a file. This check occurs *after* path resolution, and does not prevent path traversal from happening during the resolution step.
        - [7] `fs.readFileSync(absFilePath, 'utf-8')` reads the file at the resolved absolute path. If path traversal is successful, this could read files outside the intended workspace.
        - There is no explicit validation to ensure that the resolved file paths in `absFilePaths` are within the intended `workspaceUri.fsPath`.
        - Visualization:
        ```
        Attacker Controlled Input: workspace = "../../", paths = ["../../../sensitive_file.txt"]
        process.cwd(): /home/user/project
        workspace argument: "../../"
        [1] absPath (workspace path): path.resolve(/home/user/project, "../../") -> /home/user
        workspaceUri.fsPath: /home/user
        inputPath (paths argument): "../../../sensitive_file.txt"
        [3] absPath (input file path): path.resolve(/home/user, "../../../sensitive_file.txt") -> /sensitive_file.txt (Path Traversal!)
        [7] fs.readFileSync(/sensitive_file.txt) -> Sensitive file content is read if permissions allow.
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a local Vue project and install VTI globally using `npm install -g vti`.
    2. Create a sensitive file outside the Vue project directory, for example, create a file named `sensitive_data.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\temp\` (on Windows) with some sensitive content like "This is sensitive information.".
    3. Open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to simulate a workspace (this directory can be empty or contain a Vue project, the vulnerability is independent of project content).
    4. Execute the VTI diagnostics command, attempting path traversal by setting the `workspace` argument to traverse up from the current directory and then providing a path to the sensitive file in the `paths` argument. For example:
        - On Linux/macOS: `vti diagnostics --workspace ../../ --paths ../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt`
        - On Windows: `vti diagnostics --workspace ..\..\ --paths ..\..\..\temp\sensitive_data.txt`
        - Alternatively, if workspace is not easily controlled, try path traversal directly in paths: `vti diagnostics --paths ../../../tmp/sensitive_data.txt`
    5. Analyze the output of the command.
        - If VTI outputs the content of `sensitive_data.txt` or an error message that reveals the content or path of the sensitive file, it indicates a successful path traversal and the presence of the vulnerability.
        - If VTI reports an error indicating that the file is outside the workspace or access is denied, it suggests that some mitigation might be in place, or the vulnerability is not exploitable in this way for this specific path. However, further testing with different traversal depths and paths might still be needed to confirm full mitigation.
    6. If the vulnerability is confirmed, implement missing mitigations like input validation and path sanitization in `vti/src/commands/diagnostics.ts` to prevent path traversal.
