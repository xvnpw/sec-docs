### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Workspace Configuration (vetur.dev.vlsPath)
    - Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace configuration file (either `vetur.config.js` or VS Code workspace settings).
        2. In this configuration, the attacker sets the `vetur.dev.vlsPath` setting to point to a malicious Node.js script located on the attacker's controlled server or within the compromised workspace.
        3. The victim user opens a workspace in VS Code with the Vetur extension installed and the malicious configuration.
        4. When Vetur initializes, it reads the `vetur.dev.vlsPath` setting.
        5. Vetur attempts to load and execute the Node.js script specified in `vetur.dev.vlsPath` as the Vue Language Server (VLS). Because the path is under attacker control, this allows for Remote Code Execution.
        6. The attacker's malicious script executes within the VS Code extension's context, inheriting its privileges and potentially compromising the user's system and data.
    - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. A successful attack can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive information, including source code, environment variables, and potentially credentials, can be stolen.
        - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware, backdoors, or ransomware on the victim's machine.
        - Further system compromise: The attacker can leverage the initial code execution to escalate privileges or gain persistent access to the user's system.
    - Vulnerability Rank: High
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - The `vetur.dev.vlsPath` setting is presented as a development-time option, implying it's not intended for production environments, reducing the likelihood of accidental exposure in stable setups.
        - The setting's machine-local scope confines the risk to individual developer machines, limiting broader workspace-level propagation of the vulnerability through shared settings.
    - Missing Mitigations:
        - **Remove the `vetur.dev.vlsPath` setting**: Eliminating the insecure feature is the most effective mitigation. This setting is not essential for the core functionality of the extension and introduces significant risk.
        - **Documentation Warning (If Setting is Kept)**: If removal is not feasible, prominently document the high security risk associated with `vetur.dev.vlsPath`. Emphasize that it should **only** be used for local development with trusted scripts and never in shared or production-like environments.
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization (If Setting is Kept)**: If the setting must remain, implement rigorous validation of the provided path. This should include:
            - Checking if the path is within the workspace or a very restricted, predefined set of safe locations.
            - Verifying that the file at the path is indeed a Node.js script and not another executable type.
            - Employing code signing or integrity checks to ensure the script hasn't been tampered with.
    - Preconditions:
        - Attacker Control of Workspace Configuration: The attacker must be able to modify the workspace configuration, either by directly editing `vetur.config.js`, `.vscode/settings.json`, or by influencing a shared workspace settings repository.
        - Victim Opens Compromised Workspace: A victim user must open the workspace containing the malicious configuration in VS Code with the Vetur extension installed and active.
    - Source Code Analysis:
        - File: `/code/client/client.ts`
        - Code Snippet:
          ```typescript
          const devVlsPackagePath = config.get('vetur.dev.vlsPath', '');
          if (devVlsPackagePath && devVlsPackagePath !== '' && existsSync(devVlsPackagePath)) {
            serverPath = resolve(devVlsPackagePath, 'dist/vueServerMain.js');
          } else {
            serverPath = vlsModulePath;
          }

          const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
            run: { module: serverPath, transport: TransportKind.ipc, options: { execArgv: runExecArgv } },
            debug: { module: serverPath, transport: TransportKind.ipc, options: debugOptions }
          };
          ```
        - Explanation: The code in `client.ts` retrieves the value of `vetur.dev.vlsPath` from the workspace configuration. It then checks if a file exists at this path using `existsSync`. If a file is found, it's directly used as the `serverPath` for the Vue Language Server. This path is subsequently used in `serverOptions` to spawn the server process. Critically, there's no validation of the file's content or origin, allowing execution of any Node.js script pointed to by this setting.
    - Security Test Case:
        1. Setup Malicious Script: Create a file named `malicious.js` at a known location (e.g., `/tmp/malicious.js`) with the following content:
        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        const os = require('os');
        const userInfo = os.userInfo();
        fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned.txt', 'User ' + userInfo.username + ' has been pwned!');
        console.log('Malicious script executed!');
        process.exit(1);
        ```
        2. Create Malicious Configuration: Create a file named `vetur.config.js` in a test Vue project's root directory with the following content:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
          settings: {
            "vetur.dev.vlsPath": "/tmp/malicious.js" // Adjust path if needed
          }
        };
        ```
        3. Open Workspace in VS Code: Open the Vue project containing the `vetur.config.js` file in VS Code with the Vetur extension active.
        4. Observe Malicious Execution: Check for the file `/tmp/pwned.txt`. If it exists and contains the expected content ("User ... has been pwned!"), the malicious script has been successfully executed. Also, observe "Malicious script executed!" in the Vetur output channel.
