# Attack Surface Analysis for vuejs/vue

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from directly embedding user-controlled data into Vue.js templates without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
*   **Vue.js Contribution:** Vue.js templates are processed client-side, and directives like `{{ }}` and attribute bindings (e.g., `:class`, `:style`) can execute JavaScript expressions. If user input is directly placed within these expressions, it becomes vulnerable due to Vue.js's template rendering mechanism.
*   **Example:** An application displays a dynamic message using `<div>{{ dynamicMessage }}</div>`. If `dynamicMessage` is sourced from user input and an attacker sets it to `<img src=x onerror=alert('CSTI!')>`, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript alert because Vue.js renders the template content.
*   **Impact:** Full client-side compromise, including stealing cookies, session tokens, performing actions on behalf of the user, defacement, and potentially further attacks against backend systems if the client-side code interacts with them.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Never directly embed unsanitized user input into template expressions.
        *   **Use Text Interpolation ({{ }}) for Text:** Utilize `{{ }}` for displaying text content, as it automatically HTML-escapes output, preventing basic XSS.
        *   **`v-text` Directive:**  Use `v-text` directive for text content where HTML escaping is explicitly desired.
        *   **Sanitize for Attribute Bindings:** For dynamic attributes like `:class`, `:style`, or custom attributes, carefully sanitize user input before binding. Consider using allowlists or secure sanitization libraries.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of injected scripts, reducing the impact of successful CSTI.

## Attack Surface: [Component Vulnerabilities (High Severity in Third-Party and Custom Components)](./attack_surfaces/component_vulnerabilities__high_severity_in_third-party_and_custom_components_.md)

*   **Description:** High severity security flaws within Vue.js components, whether from external libraries or custom-developed, that can lead to critical vulnerabilities like XSS, prototype pollution, or remote code execution (in less common but theoretically possible scenarios within client-side JS context).
*   **Vue.js Contribution:** Vue.js applications are architected around components. The security of the application is directly dependent on the security of all components used. Vue.js's component model facilitates the use of both third-party and custom components, inheriting any vulnerabilities they may contain.
*   **Example:** A third-party rich text editor component used in a Vue.js application has a critical XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript when a user views content processed by the vulnerable component. This vulnerability is exposed because the Vue.js application integrates and renders this component.
*   **Impact:**  Client-side compromise (XSS), potentially prototype pollution leading to broader application compromise, or in extreme cases, client-side RCE-like scenarios depending on the nature of the component vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (for high severity vulnerabilities within components)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Dependency Auditing & High Severity Focus:** Regularly audit and update all dependencies, prioritizing updates for components with known high or critical severity vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning & Prioritization:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the development pipeline and prioritize addressing high and critical alerts for Vue.js components.
        *   **Thorough Code Review of Third-Party Components (Security Focus):** Before using a third-party component, conduct a focused security review, especially for components handling user input or rendering complex content.
        *   **Secure Coding for Custom Components (Security Hardening):** Implement rigorous security hardening practices when developing custom Vue.js components, with a strong emphasis on preventing XSS and other high-impact vulnerabilities.
        *   **Component Isolation & Sandboxing (Where Feasible):** Design components to be as isolated as possible and consider sandboxing techniques where feasible to limit the impact of a component compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Vue Router Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/vue_router_misconfiguration_leading_to_unauthorized_access__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure configuration or implementation of Vue Router that directly leads to unauthorized access to sensitive application areas or functionalities. This typically involves bypassing intended access controls due to flaws in route guards or route definitions.
*   **Vue.js Contribution:** Vue Router is the official routing library for Vue.js applications. Misconfigurations within Vue Router's setup directly translate to security vulnerabilities in the Vue.js application's navigation and access control.
*   **Example:** A Vue Router route guard intended to protect an administrative dashboard is incorrectly implemented. Due to a logical flaw in the guard's condition or a missing check, an unauthenticated user can directly navigate to the admin dashboard route by manipulating the URL, gaining unauthorized access to administrative functions. This is a direct consequence of how Vue Router guards are defined and applied within the Vue.js application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application features, data, or administrative functionalities. Privilege escalation and potential data breaches if sensitive operations are exposed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (when leading to unauthorized access to sensitive areas)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Route Access (Strict Enforcement):** Implement route guards with a strict "deny by default" approach, explicitly allowing access only to authorized users based on well-defined roles and permissions.
        *   **Careful Route Definition (Minimize Wildcards for Sensitive Areas):** Avoid overly broad wildcard routes for sensitive parts of the application. Define specific and restrictive routes for protected functionalities.
        *   **Robust Route Guard Logic (Thorough Testing):** Thoroughly test route guard logic to ensure it correctly enforces access control under various scenarios and cannot be bypassed through URL manipulation or other client-side techniques.
        *   **Server-Side Authorization (Redundant Security Layer):** For sensitive operations triggered by routes, always implement server-side authorization checks in addition to client-side route guards to provide a redundant security layer and prevent client-side bypasses from leading to server-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vuex State Management Exposing Sensitive Data (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/vuex_state_management_exposing_sensitive_data__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  If Vuex is used for state management, and highly sensitive data is inadvertently stored in the client-side Vuex store without proper protection, leading to potential information disclosure.
*   **Vue.js Contribution:** Vuex is the official state management library for Vue.js.  While Vuex itself is not inherently insecure, its use in managing application state can lead to vulnerabilities if developers mistakenly store sensitive information in the client-side store, making it accessible through browser developer tools or client-side code inspection.
*   **Example:**  An application stores user API keys or unencrypted personal identifiable information (PII) directly within the Vuex store for client-side access. An attacker can easily inspect the client-side JavaScript state using browser developer tools and extract this sensitive data, compromising user accounts or PII. This vulnerability arises from the developer's choice to store sensitive data in the Vuex store within a Vue.js application.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of highly sensitive data (API keys, PII, credentials). Potential for account compromise, identity theft, and further attacks leveraging the exposed sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (when highly sensitive data is exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in Client-Side State (Avoid Storing Directly):**  Strictly avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in the Vuex store. Re-evaluate the necessity of client-side access to such data.
        *   **Server-Side Data Handling for Sensitive Information (Backend Focus):** Manage highly sensitive data primarily on the server-side. Only expose absolutely necessary, non-sensitive representations of data to the client-side Vue.js application.
        *   **Secure Data Retrieval (On-Demand Fetching):** Fetch sensitive data from the server only when absolutely needed and for the shortest duration possible. Avoid persisting sensitive data in the client-side state.
        *   **Encryption for Local Storage (If Vuex Persistence is Required for Sensitive Data - Last Resort):** If persisting sensitive data client-side is unavoidable (which is strongly discouraged), implement robust client-side encryption for the sensitive parts of the Vuex state before storing it in local storage or other client-side storage mechanisms.  This should be considered a last resort and requires careful key management.
