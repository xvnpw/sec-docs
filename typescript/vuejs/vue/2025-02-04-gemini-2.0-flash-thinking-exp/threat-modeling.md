# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Vue template syntax or JavaScript code into user-controlled data rendered by Vue templates. This leads to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser or server-side during SSR, potentially resulting in account takeover, data theft, or complete application compromise.

**Impact:** Account takeover, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, website defacement, server-side code execution (in SSR scenarios).

**Vue Component Affected:** Vue Templates, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize all user-provided data before using it in Vue templates.
*   Use `v-text` for plain text display to automatically escape HTML.
*   Avoid `v-html` with user data.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   For SSR, enforce server-side input validation and output encoding.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Vue Internals or Dependencies](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_vue_internals_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Vue core, plugins, or dependencies to pollute JavaScript prototypes. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other critical vulnerabilities affecting the entire application due to unexpected object behavior.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, Denial of Service (DoS), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), widespread application malfunction.

**Vue Component Affected:** Vue Core, Vue Plugins, Dependencies (NPM packages).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Vue.js and dependencies updated to the latest versions.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Implement input validation to prevent unexpected data structures.
*   Use JavaScript security linters and static analysis tools.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Components (High Severity)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_components__high_severity_.md)

**Description:**  Developers introduce critical security flaws in custom Vue components, such as severe input validation failures, authentication bypasses, or direct access vulnerabilities. Exploitation can lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, or complete compromise of component-specific features.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, critical component malfunction, potential escalation to wider application compromise.

**Vue Component Affected:** Custom Vue Components developed for the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rigorous security testing and code reviews for custom components.
*   Follow secure coding practices, especially for input handling and authorization within components.
*   Regularly audit and update third-party libraries used within components.
*   Provide security training to developers on secure Vue.js component development.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Source Maps](./threats/information_leakage_through_source_maps.md)

**Description:** Publicly accessible source maps expose the complete, unminified source code of the Vue.js application in production. This reveals sensitive logic, algorithms, and potential vulnerabilities, significantly aiding attackers in reverse engineering and planning targeted attacks, potentially leading to full application compromise.

**Impact:** Full source code disclosure, exposure of vulnerabilities, easier reverse engineering and attack planning, potential application compromise.

**Vue Component Affected:** Build Process, Deployment Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure source maps are not deployed to production servers.
*   Configure build processes to disable source map generation for production builds.
*   Restrict access to source maps if needed for debugging in controlled environments.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities in Vue Ecosystem (High Severity)](./threats/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities_in_vue_ecosystem__high_severity_.md)

**Description:** Critical vulnerabilities in Vue.js ecosystem dependencies (including transitive dependencies) can be exploited to compromise the application. Attackers can leverage known vulnerabilities in these dependencies for remote code execution, significant data breaches, or widespread application compromise.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, denial of service, widespread application compromise due to vulnerable dependencies.

**Vue Component Affected:** NPM Dependencies, Vue Plugins, Third-Party Libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update dependencies using vulnerability scanning tools.
*   Choose reputable dependencies with active security practices.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for continuous monitoring.
*   Use dependency pinning or lock files for consistent versions.
*   Stay informed about security advisories for JavaScript and NPM packages.
