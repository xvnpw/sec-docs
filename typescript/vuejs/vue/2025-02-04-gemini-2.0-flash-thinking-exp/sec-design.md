# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Vue.js, aims to provide a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Its primary business goal is to empower developers to create interactive and performant web applications efficiently. Vue.js prioritizes developer experience, ease of learning, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of projects from small widgets to large-scale applications.

Business priorities for Vue.js are:
- Maintainability: Ensuring the framework is easy to maintain and update, reducing technical debt for projects using Vue.js.
- Performance: Providing a performant framework that enables fast and responsive user interfaces.
- Community Growth: Expanding the Vue.js community to ensure a vibrant ecosystem of libraries, tools, and support.
- Developer Experience: Focusing on making Vue.js enjoyable and efficient to use for developers of all skill levels.
- Wide Adoption: Increasing the adoption of Vue.js across different industries and project types.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could impact all applications built with Vue.js, leading to widespread security incidents.
- Supply chain attacks targeting Vue.js dependencies or build process could compromise the integrity of the framework.
- Lack of community support or maintainability issues could lead to decreased adoption and developer trust.
- Performance bottlenecks in the framework could negatively impact user experience and project success.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: GitHub repository with public access for code review and transparency. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and managing bugs and security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository issue tracker.
- security control: Community contributions and peer review process for code changes. Implemented in: GitHub pull request process.
- security control: Regular updates and releases to address reported issues and vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Vue.js release cycle.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline for Vue.js development.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Vue.js framework by external security experts.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and incident response plan for security issues in Vue.js.
- security control: Implement supply chain security measures, including dependency scanning and verification, to protect against compromised dependencies.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Vue.js framework itself, but applications built with Vue.js will require robust authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Vue.js framework itself, but applications built with Vue.js will require robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities.
- Input Validation: Vue.js applications must implement thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks (XSS, etc.) at the application level. Vue.js itself provides mechanisms for secure data binding and templating to mitigate some XSS risks.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to Vue.js framework itself, but applications built with Vue.js will need to utilize cryptography for secure data transmission and storage where necessary. Vue.js can be used in conjunction with secure communication protocols (HTTPS) and can interact with backend services that handle cryptographic operations.

## DEPLOYMENT

Vue.js itself is not deployed as a standalone application. Instead, Vue.js applications built by developers are deployed. Typical deployment scenarios for Vue.js applications include:

- Static Hosting: Deploying the built application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) to static hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or GitHub Pages.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Deploying a Node.js server that renders Vue.js applications on the server and serves pre-rendered HTML to clients. This can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or PaaS providers.
- Hybrid Rendering: Combining static site generation (SSG) with client-side rendering for specific parts of the application.

For simplicity, let's consider the static hosting deployment scenario.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Development and distribution of the Vue.js framework itself.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Vue.js framework for developers worldwide.
- Ensuring the security of applications built using Vue.js (indirectly, by providing a secure and reliable framework).

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Vue.js source code: Highly sensitive, as its compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the framework and applications built with it. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Build artifacts (published packages): Highly sensitive, as compromised packages could be distributed to millions of developers, leading to widespread supply chain attacks. Requires integrity and availability.
- Developer credentials and access keys: Highly sensitive, as their compromise could allow unauthorized access to the code repository, build pipeline, and publishing infrastructure. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Community forum user data (if any): Sensitive, depending on the data collected (usernames, emails, etc.). Requires confidentiality and integrity.
