## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Vue-Specific) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__vue-specific___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that reside within the client-side rendering and logic of the Vue.js application itself, specifically related to how Vue handles templates and user input.

    *   **1.1. Template Injection / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vue Templates (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**

        *   **Description:** This critical node represents the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user input within Vue templates. Vue templates can execute JavaScript expressions, making them vulnerable if user-controlled data is directly embedded without sanitization.

            *   **1.1.1. Inject Malicious Code via Unsanitized User Input in Templates (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**

                *   **Attack Vector Name:** Client-Side Template Injection XSS via User Input
                *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into Vue templates by providing unsanitized user input. When the template is rendered, the injected script executes in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
                *   **Example:**  A comment section in a Vue.js application allows users to input text. If the application uses `v-html` or `{{ }}` to display these comments without sanitizing HTML tags or JavaScript code, an attacker can submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views the comment, the JavaScript code will execute in their browser.
                *   **Actionable Insight:**
                    *   **Mitigation:**
                        *   **Always sanitize user-provided HTML:** Use `v-text` for plain text output whenever possible.
                        *   **Sanitize HTML using a library like DOMPurify** before using `v-html` to display user-provided HTML content.
                        *   **Avoid dynamic template compilation with user input:** Be extremely cautious when dynamically creating templates based on user input.
                        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
                *   **Risk Estimations:**
                    *   Likelihood: Medium - High
                    *   Impact: High - Critical
                    *   Effort: Low - Medium
                    *   Skill Level: Low - Medium
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Low - Medium

            *   **1.1.2. Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Template Injection (If SSR is used) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - SSR)**

                *   **Attack Vector Name:** Server-Side Template Injection in SSR Vue Application
                *   **Description:** If the Vue.js application utilizes Server-Side Rendering (SSR), vulnerabilities can arise in the SSR process. Improper handling of user input during SSR can lead to template injection vulnerabilities on the server. This is often more severe than client-side XSS as it can potentially expose server-side resources and lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
                *   **Example:** In an SSR setup, user input is incorporated into the Vue template on the server before being sent to the client. If this input is not properly sanitized and is used in a way that allows server-side JavaScript execution (e.g., within a server-side template engine context), an attacker can inject malicious code that executes on the server.
                *   **Actionable Insight:**
                    *   **Mitigation:**
                        *   **Strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side:**  Treat all user input as untrusted and rigorously validate and sanitize it before using it in SSR templates.
                        *   **Secure SSR configuration:** Ensure the SSR environment (e.g., Node.js server) is properly secured and isolated. Follow security best practices for server configuration.
                        *   **Regularly update SSR dependencies:** Keep Node.js, SSR related libraries (like `vue-server-renderer`), and other server-side dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
                        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the SSR process with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
                *   **Risk Estimations:**
                    *   Likelihood: Low - Medium
                    *   Impact: Critical
                    *   Effort: Medium - High
                    *   Skill Level: Medium - High
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - High

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Build Process & Development Environment (Vue-Specific Context) (HIGH-RISK PATH - Supply Chain)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_build_process_&_development_environment__vue-specific_context___high-risk_path_-_supply_c_6d65b33b.md)

*   **Description:** This path highlights the increasing risk of supply chain attacks targeting the development and build process of Vue.js applications. Compromising dependencies during the build can have severe consequences.

    *   **2.1. Compromised Dependencies during Build (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - Supply Chain)**

        *   **Description:** This critical node represents the danger of using compromised or malicious dependencies within the Vue.js project.  Modern JavaScript projects heavily rely on npm packages, and attackers can inject malicious code by compromising these packages.

            *   **2.1.1. Malicious Packages in `node_modules` (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - Supply Chain)**

                *   **Attack Vector Name:** Supply Chain Attack via Malicious npm Packages
                *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the application by introducing malicious code through compromised npm packages used in the Vue.js project. This can occur through various methods, including:
                    *   **Typosquatting:** Creating packages with names similar to popular packages, hoping developers will accidentally install the malicious one.
                    *   **Account Compromise:** Gaining access to the npm account of a legitimate package maintainer and injecting malicious code into updates.
                    *   **Compromised Dependency:** Injecting malicious code into a less popular dependency that is then pulled in by a more widely used package.
                *   **Example:** An attacker creates a package named `vues-router` (typosquatting `vue-router`). A developer, making a typo, installs this malicious package instead of the legitimate one. The malicious package contains code that steals environment variables or backdoors the application during the build process.
                *   **Actionable Insight:**
                    *   **Mitigation:**
                        *   **Dependency integrity checks:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, and `npm ci`/`yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to detect known vulnerabilities and ensure dependency integrity.
                        *   **Lock file usage:** Commit and maintain `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected updates.
                        *   **Regularly audit dependencies:** Review and audit project dependencies for security, legitimacy, and maintainability. Consider using tools to analyze dependency trees and identify potential risks.
                        *   **Use reputable package sources:** Prefer packages from well-known and trusted sources. Be wary of packages with very few downloads or recent changes from unknown authors.
                        *   **Consider using a private npm registry:** For sensitive projects, using a private npm registry can provide more control over package sources.
                        *   **Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain an SBOM to track all dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.
                *   **Risk Estimations:**
                    *   Likelihood: Low - Medium
                    *   Impact: Critical
                    *   Effort: Medium - High
                    *   Skill Level: Medium - High
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - High
