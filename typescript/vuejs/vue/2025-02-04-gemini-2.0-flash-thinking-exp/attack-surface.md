# Attack Surface Analysis for vuejs/vue

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Template Injection (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_template_injection__xss_.md)

**Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the client-side template rendering process. When user-controlled data is not properly sanitized and is embedded into Vue templates, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Vue Contribution:** Vue.js's template system, while powerful, renders templates client-side. The ease of dynamic rendering with features like `{{ }}` and `v-html` can inadvertently expose vulnerabilities if developers are not careful about sanitizing user inputs before displaying them in templates. `v-html` is particularly dangerous as it renders raw HTML without escaping.

**Example:**

*   A Vue.js application displays user-submitted blog posts.
*   A malicious user crafts a blog post containing `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` within the content.
*   If the application uses `v-html="blogPost.content"` to render the blog post content, the malicious script will execute when another user views the post. Using `{{ blogPost.content }}` would escape the HTML and prevent the XSS.

**Impact:**

*   Cookie theft and session hijacking.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Defacement of the web page.
*   Keylogging and data theft.
*   Malware distribution.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer Mitigation:**
    *   **Always escape user-provided content by default.** Use `{{ }}` for text interpolation, which automatically escapes HTML entities.
    *   **Absolutely avoid using `v-html` with user-provided content.** If HTML rendering is essential, use a trusted and well-maintained sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to sanitize the HTML on the server-side or client-side *before* rendering with `v-html`.
    *   **Sanitize user input on the server-side.** Perform robust input validation and sanitization on the backend before sending data to the Vue.js frontend.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.** Configure CSP to restrict the sources of scripts and other resources, significantly limiting the impact of XSS attacks even if they occur.

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:** Exploiting JavaScript's prototype inheritance mechanism to modify the prototype of built-in objects (like `Object.prototype`). This can lead to unexpected application behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities by globally altering object properties.

**Vue Contribution:** Vue.js's reactivity system and component options heavily rely on object manipulation and merging. If user-provided data is merged into component options or data objects without proper validation, it can become a vector for prototype pollution. Vue's merging strategies, if not carefully implemented by developers, could inadvertently propagate polluted properties throughout the application.

**Example:**

*   A Vue component accepts user-provided settings as props.
*   The component uses `Object.assign({}, defaultSettings, userSettings)` to merge user-provided settings with default settings.
*   A malicious user provides a prop like `__proto__.isAdmin = true`.
*   If not properly handled, this could pollute `Object.prototype` with the `isAdmin` property, potentially granting unintended administrative privileges in other parts of the application that rely on checking `isAdmin` on objects.

**Impact:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) due to unexpected application behavior and crashes.
*   Circumvention of security checks and authorization mechanisms.
*   Data manipulation or corruption leading to business logic errors.
*   Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) in specific scenarios depending on how the polluted prototype properties are used within the application.

**Risk Severity:** **High** (Severity can be critical depending on the application and how prototype pollution is exploitable).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer Mitigation:**
    *   **Strictly avoid merging user-provided data directly into component options or data objects without rigorous validation.**
    *   **Use object destructuring or spread syntax with extreme caution.** Be highly mindful of how properties are copied and avoid unintentionally copying potentially malicious prototype-polluting properties from user input.
    *   **Implement robust validation and sanitization of user input.** Ensure data conforms to strictly defined expected structures and types before using it in object operations.
    *   **Freeze objects when possible and appropriate.** Use `Object.freeze()` to prevent modification of objects where immutability is desired, especially for default settings or configuration objects.
    *   **Employ safer object merging techniques.** Consider using libraries or utility functions specifically designed to prevent prototype pollution during object merging.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If using SSR, the application renders Vue components on the server. This introduces server-side execution of JavaScript, expanding the attack surface to include server-side vulnerabilities common to Node.js applications and SSR processes.

**Vue Contribution:** Vue.js provides SSR capabilities, which, while offering benefits, necessitate running Vue components and related JavaScript code on a server (typically Node.js). This server-side execution introduces new attack vectors that are not present in purely client-side rendered applications and requires careful security considerations for the server environment and SSR process.

**Example:**

*   An SSR Vue.js application fetches user profile data from a database on the server to pre-render the user's dashboard.
*   If the database query logic in the SSR process is vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access or modify sensitive data through the SSR application.
*   If server-side dependencies used for SSR (e.g., libraries for data fetching, templating) have known vulnerabilities, these can be exploited to compromise the server.

**Impact:**

*   Server-side vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   Exposure of highly sensitive server-side data and application secrets.
*   Full Server compromise and potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server infrastructure.
*   Widespread Denial of Service (DoS) against the server and potentially the entire application.

**Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (Depending on the severity of server-side vulnerabilities and the criticality of the server infrastructure).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly secure the Node.js server environment.** Adhere to strict Node.js security best practices: consistently keep dependencies updated, implement secure coding practices, enforce robust access controls, and promptly patch the server operating system and Node.js runtime.
    *   **Meticulously sanitize all data used in SSR rendering.** Ensure that any data rendered on the server, especially data originating from external sources or user inputs, is rigorously sanitized to prevent server-side injection attacks.
    *   **Aggressively secure server-side dependencies.** Regularly audit and update *all* server-side dependencies used for SSR. Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools within the CI/CD pipeline to proactively detect and remediate vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Implement comprehensive error handling and logging in the SSR process.** Prevent sensitive information leakage through error messages and implement detailed logging to aid in debugging and security incident response.
    *   **Strictly adhere to secure coding practices for server-side JavaScript.** Proactively prevent common server-side vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, and SSRF through secure coding guidelines, code reviews, and security testing.
