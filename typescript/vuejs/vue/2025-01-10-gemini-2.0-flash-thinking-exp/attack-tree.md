# Attack Tree Analysis for vuejs/vue

Objective: Gain unauthorized access or control over the Vue.js application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the Vue.js framework, focusing on the most likely and impactful attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Sub-Tree with High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

Root: Compromise Vue.js Application
- OR Exploit Template Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    - AND Inject Malicious Script via Template (CRITICAL NODE)
        - OR Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            - Exploit Insecurely Sanitized Data in SSR Context (CRITICAL NODE)
        - OR Client-Side Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            - Exploit v-html Directive with User-Controlled Data (CRITICAL NODE)
- OR Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vue.js Ecosystem (Indirectly) (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    - AND Leverage Vulnerabilities in Popular Vue.js Plugins or Libraries (CRITICAL NODE)
        - Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Components (CRITICAL NODE)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit how Vue.js renders templates.

- **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Script via Template:**
    - This is the overarching goal of template injection attacks. The attacker aims to inject JavaScript code into the application's templates, which will then be executed in the victim's browser.

    - **High-Risk Path: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection:**
        - **Critical Node: Exploit Insecurely Sanitized Data in SSR Context:**
            - **Attack Vector:** When using Server-Side Rendering, the initial HTML is rendered on the server. If data that includes malicious scripts is not properly sanitized before being embedded in the server-rendered HTML, these scripts will execute when the page is loaded in the user's browser.
            - **Impact:** This can lead to account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.

    - **High-Risk Path: Client-Side Injection:**
        - **Critical Node: Exploit v-html Directive with User-Controlled Data:**
            - **Attack Vector:** The `v-html` directive in Vue.js renders raw HTML. If user-provided data (e.g., from a form input, URL parameter, or database) is directly bound to an element using `v-html` without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
            - **Impact:** This is a direct and easily exploitable path to XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application's origin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vue.js Ecosystem (Indirectly)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_vue_js_ecosystem__indirectly_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and plugins used within the Vue.js application.

- **Critical Node: Leverage Vulnerabilities in Popular Vue.js Plugins or Libraries:**
    - **Attack Vector:** Many Vue.js applications rely on external libraries for various functionalities. If these libraries contain security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. This often involves using known exploits for specific versions of the libraries.

    - **Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Components:**
        - **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify known security flaws (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution) in the specific versions of the third-party components used by the application. They then craft requests or provide input that triggers these vulnerabilities.
        - **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the third-party component. It can range from XSS and information disclosure to more severe issues like remote code execution on the server or client.
