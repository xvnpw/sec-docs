# Attack Surface Analysis for vuejs/vue

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application that are then executed in the user's browser due to improper handling of user-provided data within Vue templates.
*   **How Vue Contributes:** Vue's templating system, particularly the use of `v-html` or bypassing default escaping mechanisms, allows for the direct rendering of unescaped HTML, including potentially malicious scripts.
*   **Example:**  A comment section where user input is directly rendered using `v-html` without sanitization. An attacker could submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute when other users view the comment.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize Vue's default escaping (`{{ }}`).
    *   Use `v-text` for displaying user-provided text.
    *   Exercise extreme caution with `v-html` and sanitize data server-side before using it with `v-html`.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Attack Surface: [Component Vulnerabilities (Third-Party)](./attack_surfaces/component_vulnerabilities__third-party_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist in third-party Vue components used within the application.
*   **How Vue Contributes:** Vue's component-based architecture encourages the use of external libraries. If these libraries contain vulnerabilities, they directly impact the application.
*   **Example:**  A date picker component with a known XSS vulnerability. When a user interacts with the component, the malicious script embedded within it could execute.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability within the component, ranging from XSS to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet third-party components before use, checking for known vulnerabilities and security audits.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider the reputation and maintenance of the component library.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws arise when using Server-Side Rendering with Vue.js, particularly related to handling user input or interactions during the rendering process.
*   **How Vue Contributes:** SSR involves running Vue components on the server. If user input is not properly sanitized before being used in the rendering process, it can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or other server-side vulnerabilities. Improper handling can also lead to XSS if server-rendered content is not correctly escaped.
*   **Example:**  An SSR application that takes user input to generate dynamic meta tags. If this input is not sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious content that is then rendered on the server and sent to other users.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, information disclosure, XSS affecting users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat the server-side rendering environment with the same security considerations as any backend application.
    *   Sanitize user input rigorously before using it in the server-side rendering process.
    *   Be cautious with third-party libraries used during SSR and ensure they are secure.
