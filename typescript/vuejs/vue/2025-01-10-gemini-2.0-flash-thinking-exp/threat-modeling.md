# Threat Model Analysis for vuejs/vue

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./threats/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Vue template syntax into user-controllable data that is subsequently rendered by the application. This allows them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. For example, an attacker could submit a comment containing `{{constructor.constructor('alert("XSS")')()}}` which, if not properly handled, would execute the alert.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, including access to cookies, local storage, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the user. This can lead to data theft, account takeover, and further propagation of attacks.
    *   **Which https://github.com/vuejs/vue component is affected:** `template compiler`, specifically when processing string templates or dynamically generated templates with unsanitized user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use string templates with user-provided data.** Prefer render functions or pre-compiled templates.
        *   **If string templates are unavoidable, rigorously sanitize user input** to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as Vue template syntax.
        *   **Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `v-html`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__v-html_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML and JavaScript code into data that is then rendered using the `v-html` directive. Vue.js will render this HTML as is, including any embedded scripts. For instance, if a blog post title fetched from an API contains `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`, using `v-html` to display it will execute the script.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to CSTI, this allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
    *   **Which https://github.com/vuejs/vue component is affected:** `v-dom patching` and the `v-html` directive itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `v-html` with untrusted data.**
        *   **Sanitize all user-provided HTML content on the server-side** before storing or transmitting it. Use a robust HTML sanitization library.
        *   **If client-side sanitization is necessary, use a trusted library** designed for this purpose and apply it before rendering with `v-html`.
        *   **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP)** to mitigate the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Directives](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_directives.md)

*   **Description:**  If custom directives are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, a custom directive that directly manipulates the DOM based on user input without proper sanitization could be exploited for XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the directive's functionality, this could lead to XSS, DOM manipulation vulnerabilities, or other unintended behavior.
    *   **Which https://github.com/vuejs/vue component is affected:** The `directives` module and the implementation of specific custom directives.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly review and test custom directives for potential security flaws.**
        *   **Sanitize any user input used within custom directives before manipulating the DOM.**
        *   **Avoid direct DOM manipulation in directives if possible.** Consider alternative approaches using Vue's reactivity system.
