Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the core Vue.js library:

**High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Vue.js**

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe HTML Rendering
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application's data, which is then rendered as HTML by Vue using the `v-html` directive. The browser executes this script, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf. This directly involves how Vue renders content.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, spreading malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** `v-html` directive in Vue templates (part of Vue's template syntax).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `v-html` for user-provided content.
        *   Sanitize user input on the server-side before it reaches the Vue application.
        *   If `v-html` is necessary, use a trusted HTML sanitization library.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Object Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the prototype chain of JavaScript objects, potentially injecting malicious properties or functions that can affect the behavior of the Vue application or its dependencies. This can exploit how Vue's reactivity system handles object properties and updates.
    *   **Impact:**  Application malfunction, privilege escalation, remote code execution (in some scenarios).
    *   **Affected Component:** Vue's reactivity system (core part of Vue.js).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Vue.js updated to the latest versions, as security patches often address prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   Be cautious when using third-party libraries and thoroughly vet them for potential security issues that might interact with Vue's reactivity.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data from reaching sensitive parts of the application.
        *   Freeze or seal objects where possible to prevent modification of their prototypes.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Dynamic Components
    *   **Description:** If the `component` tag with the `:is` attribute is used to dynamically render components based on user input without proper validation, an attacker might be able to load unexpected or malicious components. This directly involves Vue's component rendering mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution if malicious components are loaded, application malfunction.
    *   **Affected Component:** `component` tag with `:is` attribute in Vue templates (part of Vue's template syntax).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a whitelist of allowed component names for dynamic rendering.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to determine which component to render.
        *   Implement strict validation on the input used for dynamic component selection.
