### Key Attack Surface List: Vue.js Specific (High & Critical)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Vue.js, focusing on those with High or Critical risk severity.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application's templates, which are then executed in the user's browser.
    *   **How Vue Contributes:** Vue's `v-html` directive allows rendering raw HTML. If user-provided or untrusted data is directly bound to `v-html` without sanitization, it can lead to XSS. Even using double curly braces `{{ }}` with unsanitized HTML can be problematic in certain contexts or with specific configurations.
    *   **Example:** A user comment form where the comment content is rendered using `v-html="comment.content"`. If a malicious user submits a comment like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, this script will execute when the comment is displayed.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer `v-text` or text interpolation (`{{ }}`) for displaying user-generated content whenever possible.** These methods automatically escape HTML entities, preventing script execution.
        *   **Sanitize user input before rendering it using `v-html`.** Use a trusted HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) on the client-side or server-side.
        *   **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.** This can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if it occurs.

*   **Attack Surface:** Prototype Pollution

    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the prototype chain of JavaScript objects, potentially injecting properties that affect the behavior of the application globally.
    *   **How Vue Contributes:** Vue's reactivity system relies on observing changes to objects. If an attacker can manipulate the prototype of a Vue instance's data or a globally accessible object, they can inject properties that Vue's reactivity system might pick up and use unexpectedly. This can be exploited through vulnerabilities in dependencies or improper handling of user input that gets merged into objects.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable dependency used by the Vue application allows setting arbitrary properties on objects. An attacker could set a property on `Object.prototype` that Vue's internal logic relies on, causing unexpected behavior or even denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, denial of service, potential for privilege escalation or remote code execution in certain scenarios.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep all dependencies, including Vue itself, up-to-date.** Vulnerabilities leading to prototype pollution are often patched in newer versions.
        *   **Carefully review and sanitize any user input that is used to extend or merge objects within the application.** Avoid directly merging user input into critical objects.
        *   **Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.**
        *   **Consider using object freezing or sealing techniques in critical parts of the application to prevent prototype modification.**

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Specific Issues

    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities that arise when using Vue.js for server-side rendering.
    *   **How Vue Contributes:** When using SSR, the initial HTML is rendered on the server. If server-side code doesn't properly sanitize data before rendering, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities that are executed before the client-side Vue application takes over.
    *   **Example:** User-generated content is rendered on the server-side without sanitization and included in the initial HTML. A malicious script embedded in this content will execute in the user's browser before the Vue application is fully loaded.
    *   **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities, potential exposure of server-side resources or information if not handled carefully.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure all data rendered on the server-side is properly sanitized before being included in the HTML.** Use server-side HTML sanitization libraries.
        *   **Be cautious about including user-provided data directly in the initial SSR payload.**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices for server-side logic and data handling.**
