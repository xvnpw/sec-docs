# BUSINESS POSTURE

Vue.js is a popular, open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications (SPAs). Its core library focuses on the view layer only, making it easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue.js is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated SPAs when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

Business Priorities:

- Maintainability: Ensure the framework remains easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- Performance: Provide a fast and efficient rendering engine for optimal user experience.
- Adoption: Encourage widespread use by developers and companies.
- Community: Foster a vibrant and supportive community around the framework.
- Compatibility: Ensure backward compatibility and smooth upgrades.
- Scalability: Enable the development of both small and large-scale applications.

Business Goals:

- Be a leading JavaScript framework for UI development.
- Provide a developer-friendly and productive environment.
- Offer a performant and scalable solution for building modern web applications.
- Maintain a strong and active community.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Loss of community trust due to unaddressed security vulnerabilities.
- Decreased adoption due to performance issues or instability.
- Inability to keep up with evolving web standards and browser technologies.
- Fragmentation of the ecosystem due to competing or incompatible extensions.
- Project abandonment or lack of maintainers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Regular code reviews: The Vue.js core team and community contributors perform code reviews to identify and address potential security issues. Described in contribution guidelines.
- security control: Security audits: Vue.js has undergone security audits by third-party security researchers.
- security control: Vulnerability disclosure program: Vue.js has a vulnerability disclosure program that encourages responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. Described in documentation.
- security control: Dependency management: Vue.js carefully manages its dependencies to minimize the risk of supply chain attacks. Described in documentation and build configuration.
- security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility: Vue.js is designed to be compatible with CSP, which helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Described in documentation.
- security control: Automated testing: Vue.js has an extensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, which help identify and prevent regressions, including security-related ones. Described in contribution guidelines.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions: While community contributions are valuable, they also introduce a risk of malicious or unintentionally insecure code being introduced. This is mitigated by code reviews and automated testing.
- accepted risk: XSS vulnerabilities in user-provided templates: If users are allowed to provide their own Vue.js templates, there is a risk of XSS vulnerabilities. This is a fundamental risk of allowing user-generated content and should be addressed by sanitizing user input and educating users about the risks.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement a regular static analysis (SAST) process to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) to identify vulnerabilities in running applications.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses.
- security control: Establish a security champions program to promote security awareness and best practices within the development team and community.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core framework, as Vue.js is a front-end library. Authentication is typically handled on the server-side.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the core framework. Authorization is typically handled on the server-side.
- Input Validation:
    - Vue.js provides built-in directives and mechanisms for handling user input, such as `v-model`.
    - Developers should carefully validate and sanitize all user input, especially when rendering it directly in the DOM or using it in templates.
    - Avoid using `v-html` with untrusted user input, as this can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Use `v-text` or other safer alternatives instead.
- Cryptography:
    - Vue.js does not provide any specific cryptographic functionality.
    - Cryptographic operations should be handled on the server-side or using dedicated libraries.
    - Sensitive data should be transmitted over secure channels (HTTPS).
