                                                                                   /

                                                                                 /

                                                                           Vue Component

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: [G] ---> [A2] ---> [A2.1] (Unsanitized `v-html`)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1__g__---__a2__---__a2_1___unsanitized__v-html__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most common and direct path to XSS in Vue.js applications. The attacker exploits the `v-html` directive, which is used to render raw HTML. If user-supplied data is directly bound to `v-html` without proper sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Example:**
    *   A blog comment section where comments are rendered using `<div v-html="comment.content"></div>`. If `comment.content` is not sanitized, an attacker can submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the user's session, data exfiltration, defacement)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial to exploit if the vulnerability exists)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review or dynamic analysis to find the vulnerability; runtime detection of the *exploit* is possible)
*   **Mitigation:** *Always* sanitize user-supplied data before binding it to `v-html`. Use a dedicated sanitization library like DOMPurify.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: [G] ---> [A1] ---> [A1.2] (Outdated Vue.js Core Library)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2__g__---__a1__---__a1_2___outdated_vue_js_core_library_.md)

*   **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of the Vue.js core library that contains known vulnerabilities. Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An older version of Vue.js might have a vulnerability in its template compiler that allows for XSS under specific circumstances. An attacker could craft a payload that triggers this vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Many projects don't update dependencies immediately)
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for XSS and other vulnerabilities, depending on the specific outdated version)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Finding outdated versions is easy; exploits may be publicly available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (Basic version checking and potentially applying existing exploits)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Version checks are straightforward)
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Vue.js to the latest stable version. Use dependency management tools (npm, yarn) to track and update versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: [G] ---> [A5] ---> [A5.1] (Known Vulnerable Vue Component)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3__g__---__a5__---__a5_1___known_vulnerable_vue_component_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a third-party Vue.js component (e.g., a UI library, router, state management library) that has a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A popular Vue.js UI component might have a vulnerability in how it handles user input in a specific form field, allowing for XSS.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the popularity of the component and how quickly it's updated)
*   **Impact:** High (Varies depending on the component, but often leads to XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low (Exploits may be publicly available)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Finding and applying exploits)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Component version checking)
*   **Mitigation:** Carefully vet third-party components. Keep them updated and monitor for security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: [G] ---> [A4] ---> [A4.1] (If SSR is used, and unsanitized data is present)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4__g__---__a4__---__a4_1___if_ssr_is_used__and_unsanitized_data_is_present_.md)

*   **Description:** This path is specific to applications using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Vue.js (e.g., Nuxt.js). If the server-side rendering process doesn't properly sanitize data used in HTML attributes, an attacker can inject malicious code.
*   **Example:** If user data is used to populate an `<img>` tag's `alt` attribute without sanitization during SSR, an attacker could inject JavaScript using an `onerror` event handler: `<img alt="User provided data" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the SSR implementation and data handling practices)
*   **Impact:** High (XSS or other injection attacks)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the SSR setup)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (SSR and security knowledge)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code review and dynamic analysis)
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure that *all* data rendered on the server is properly sanitized, both in HTML content and in the initial application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: [G] ---> [A3] ---> [A3.1] (If component props are mishandled)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5__g__---__a3__---__a3_1___if_component_props_are_mishandled_.md)

*    **Description:** If an attacker can control the values passed as props to a component, and those props are used in a way that allows for template injection (e.g., within a `v-model` binding or similar), they could inject malicious code.
*   **Example:** A component might accept a `message` prop and render it using `<div v-html="message"></div>`. If the application doesn't sanitize the `message` prop before passing it to the component, an attacker could provide a malicious value.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how props are used and validated)
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for XSS)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding vulnerable components and understanding how props are used)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Understanding component interactions and Vue.js data binding)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code review and dynamic analysis)
*   **Mitigation:** Treat component props, especially those used in rendering, as potentially untrusted. Validate and sanitize them appropriately.
