### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Godot Editor, Debugger Launch, Language Server Start, and Icon Generation Script

- Description:
    1. The extension is vulnerable to command injection in multiple areas due to insecure handling of paths related to the Godot editor executable.
    2. **Godot Editor, Debugger, and Language Server Launch:** The extension allows users to configure the path to the Godot editor executable via the `godotTools.editorPath.godot3` and `godotTools.editorPath.godot4` settings. This configured path is used in commands for "Open workspace with Godot editor", "Start Language Server (Headless LSP)", and when launching the debugger.  The extension also reads these settings from workspace configurations (`.code-workspace` files), allowing workspace settings to override user/global settings.
    3. In these commands, the configured Godot editor path is directly embedded into shell commands using template literals without sufficient sanitization.
    4. **Icon Generation Script:** The `generate_icons.ts` script, used to generate themed icons, takes the path to the Godot repository as a command-line argument. This path is also directly used in `child_process.exec` commands without sanitization.
    5. An attacker could configure the Godot editor path setting (either through user settings or by providing a malicious workspace configuration) or influence the arguments passed to the icon generation script to include malicious shell commands.
    6. When the extension executes commands like "Open workspace with Godot editor", "Start Language Server (Headless LSP)", starts debugging, or when the icon generation script is run, these malicious commands would be executed by the system shell.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or cause denial of service.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project uses `verify_godot_version` to check the Godot executable version for editor, debugger and language server launch, but this function still executes the provided path to get the version, and does not prevent command injection if the path itself is malicious.
    - `clean_godot_path` function is used to remove surrounding quotes and handle macOS `.app` paths for editor, debugger and language server launch, but it does not sanitize against command injection characters.
    - None in the `generate_icons.ts` script for icon generation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all path inputs (`godotTools.editorPath.godot3`, `godotTools.editorPath.godot4` settings, and the Godot repository path in `generate_icons.ts`). Sanitize these paths to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before constructing shell commands.
    - **Parameterized execution:**  Avoid using shell interpolation when spawning processes. Utilize parameterized execution or safer APIs for process spawning that avoid shell interpolation, such as `child_process.spawn` with arguments array instead of `shell: true` and template literals for command construction.
    - **Workspace setting warnings:** Display a warning to the user when workspace settings override the global/user settings for `godotTools.editorPath.*` to increase awareness of potential risks from opening workspaces from untrusted sources.
    - **Path restrictions:** Consider restricting the execution of the Godot editor to paths within the workspace or known safe locations to limit the attack surface. For `generate_icons.ts`, validate if the provided path is indeed a Godot repository and potentially restrict allowed paths.

- Preconditions:
    - **Godot Editor, Debugger, and Language Server Launch:**
        - The attacker needs to be able to modify the VSCode settings for the Godot Tools extension. This could be achieved by:
            - Social engineering to trick a user into manually changing the settings.
            - Convincing a user to open a workspace containing a malicious `.code-workspace` file that sets a malicious `godotTools.editorPath.godot3` or `godotTools.editorPath.godot4`.
            - If there are other vulnerabilities in VSCode or other extensions that allow settings modification.
            - Supply chain attack by compromising a settings sync service if used by the victim.
    - **Icon Generation Script:**
        - While direct external exploitation in a VSCode extension context is limited, an attacker would need to find a way to influence the arguments passed to the `generate_icons.ts` script. This could become a risk if combined with another vulnerability that allows control over the extension's execution environment or configuration, or if a developer runs the script manually with attacker-controlled input.

- Source Code Analysis:

    1. **File: `/code/src/extension.ts` - `open_workspace_with_editor` function:**
        ```typescript
        async function open_workspace_with_editor() {
            // ...
            const settingName = `editorPath.godot${projectVersion[0]}`;
            const result = verify_godot_version(get_configuration(settingName), projectVersion[0]);
            const godotPath = result.godotPath;
            // ...
            case "SUCCESS": {
                let command = `"${godotPath}" --path "${projectDir}" -e`; // Vulnerable command construction
                // ...
                const options: vscode.ExtensionTerminalOptions = {
                    name: "Godot Editor",
                    iconPath: get_extension_uri("resources/godot_icon.svg"),
                    pty: new GodotEditorTerminal(command), // Command is passed to terminal
                    isTransient: true,
                };
                const terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal(options);
                // ...
                break;
            }
            // ...
        }

        class GodotEditorTerminal implements vscode.Pseudoterminal {
            // ...
            open(initialDimensions: vscode.TerminalDimensions | undefined): void {
                const proc = subProcess("GodotEditor", this.command, { shell: true, detached: true }); // shell: true is used
                // ...
            }
            // ...
        }
        ```
        The `command` variable is constructed using template literals embedding `godotPath` and other parameters, and then executed using `subProcess` with `shell: true`, making it vulnerable to command injection. The `godotPath` is retrieved using `get_configuration`, which can read from workspace settings, allowing for workspace-based attacks.

    2. **File: `/code/src/lsp/ClientConnectionManager.ts` - `start_language_server` function:**
        ```typescript
        private async start_language_server() {
            // ...
            const settingName = `editorPath.godot${projectVersion[0]}`;
            let godotPath = get_configuration(settingName);
            const result = verify_godot_version(godotPath, projectVersion[0]);
            godotPath = result.godotPath;
            // ...
            this.client.port = await get_free_port();
            // ...
            const command = `"${godotPath}" --path "${projectDir}" --editor ${headlessFlags} --lsp-port ${this.client.port}`; // Vulnerable command construction
            const lspProcess = subProcess("LSP", command, { shell: true, detached: true }); // shell: true is used
            // ...
        }
        ```
        Similar to `open_workspace_with_editor`, the `command` is constructed vulnerably and executed with `shell: true`. The `godotPath` is also retrieved using `get_configuration`, making it susceptible to workspace setting attacks.

    3. **File: `/code/src/debugger/godot3/server_controller.ts` and `/code/src/debugger/godot4/server_controller.ts` - `launch` function:**
        ```typescript
        public async launch(args: LaunchRequestArguments) {
            // ...
            let command = `"${godotPath}" --path "${args.project}"`; // Vulnerable command construction
            const address = args.address.replace("tcp://", "");
            command += ` --remote-debug "${address}:${args.port}"`;
            // ...
            command += this.session.debug_data.get_breakpoint_string();
            // ...
            log.info(`Launching game process using command: '${command}'`);
            const debugProcess = subProcess("debug", command, { shell: true, detached: true }); // shell: true is used
            // ...
        }
        ```
        Again, the `command` is vulnerably constructed with `godotPath` and other parameters and executed with `shell: true`. This pattern is present in both Godot 3 and Godot 4 debugger server controllers. The `godotPath` is also retrieved using `get_configuration`, making it susceptible to workspace setting attacks.

    4. **File:** `/code/tools/generate_icons.ts`
        ```typescript
        async function exec(command) {
        	const { stdout, stderr } = await _exec(command); // Potential command injection here
        	return stdout;
        }

        async function run() {
        	if (godotPath == undefined) {
        		console.log("Please provide the absolute path to your godot repo");
        		return;
        	}

        	const original_cwd = process.cwd();

        	process.chdir(godotPath); // Change working directory to potentially attacker-controlled path

        	const diff = (await exec(git.diff)).trim(); // Command injection risk
        	if (diff) {
        		console.log("There appear to be uncommitted changes in your godot repo");
        		console.log("Revert or stash these changes and try again");
        		return;
        	}

        	const branch = (await exec(git.check_branch)).trim(); // Command injection risk
        	...
        }
        ```
        In `generate_icons.ts`, the `godotPath` is taken directly from `process.argv[2]` and used in `exec` calls to execute git commands. This allows for command injection if a malicious path is provided as an argument when running the script. The use of `process.chdir(godotPath)` further amplifies the risk by changing the working directory to the attacker-controlled path before executing commands.

- Security Test Case:

    1. **Test Case 1: Exploiting Settings (Godot Editor Launch)**
        1. Open VSCode without any workspace.
        2. Go to VSCode settings and find the `godotTools.editorPath.godot4` or `godotTools.editorPath.godot3` setting in user settings.
        3. Set the value of this setting to a malicious command, for example: `/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator; echo vulnerable > /tmp/vuln.txt;`. (Note: the exact malicious command will depend on the operating system. `/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator` is a valid executable path on macOS that will also execute the additional command after semicolon). For Windows, a similar path to `calc.exe` can be used, and for Linux, `gnome-calculator` or similar. For testing purposes, a simple `touch /tmp/vuln.txt` or `echo vulnerable > /tmp/vuln.txt` might be more convenient.
        4. Open a Godot project folder in VSCode.
        5. Execute the "Godot Tools: Open workspace with Godot editor" command from the command palette.
        6. Check if the malicious command was executed. In this example, check if the file `/tmp/vuln.txt` was created with the content "vulnerable".

    2. **Test Case 2: Exploiting Workspace Settings (Godot Editor Launch)**
        1. Create a new folder named `godot_vuln_test`.
        2. Inside `godot_vuln_test`, create a file named `malicious.sh` (or `malicious.bat` on Windows) with the following content:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Vulnerable!" > /tmp/vuln.txt # or C:\vuln.txt on Windows
            ```
            (For Windows `malicious.bat`):
            ```bat
            @echo off
            echo Vulnerable! > C:\vuln.txt
            ```
            Make sure to make the script executable (`chmod +x malicious.sh`).
        3. Inside `godot_vuln_test`, create a file named `test.code-workspace` with the following content, adjusting the path to `malicious.sh` (or `malicious.bat`):
            ```jsonc
            {
                "folders": [
                    {
                        "path": "."
                    }
                ],
                "settings": {
                    "godotTools.editorPath.godot4": "/tmp/malicious.sh" // or "C:\\vuln\\malicious.bat" on Windows, adjust the path
                }
            }
            ```
            Adjust the path to point to the location of `malicious.sh` or `malicious.bat` you created.
        4. Open VSCode and then open the `godot_vuln_test` folder as a workspace by opening the `test.code-workspace` file.
        5. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute the command "Godot Tools: Open workspace with Godot editor".
        6. Check if the file `/tmp/vuln.txt` (or `C:\vuln.txt` on Windows) has been created and contains the text "Vulnerable!". If it does, the vulnerability is confirmed.

    3. **Test Case 3: Exploiting Settings (Language Server Start and Debugger Launch)**
        1. Repeat steps 1-3 of Test Case 1 to set a malicious path in user settings.
        2. Open a Godot project folder in VSCode.
        3. Execute "Godot Tools: Start Language Server" command from the command palette and check if the malicious command is executed (e.g., check for `/tmp/vuln.txt`).
        4. Start debugging a Godot project (e.g., "Debug Current File" or "Debug Pinned File") and check if the malicious command is executed again.

    4. **Test Case 4: Exploiting `generate_icons.ts` script**
        - **Warning**: This test case involves executing a script that might be vulnerable to command injection. Run it in a safe testing environment and understand the risks.
        1. Prepare a malicious Godot repository path. For example, create a directory named `test_repo; touch injected.txt;` in a safe location. Note the absolute path to this directory.
        2. Navigate to the extension's directory in your file system (e.g., `~/.vscode/extensions/...`).
        3. Open a terminal in the `tools` directory of the extension (`/code/tools`).
        4. Execute the script directly using `ts-node generate_icons.ts "/path/to/test_repo; touch injected.txt;"` (replace `/path/to/test_repo` with the actual path to your malicious repo directory). Ensure you have `ts-node` installed globally or adjust the command accordingly.
        5. Observe if the `injected.txt` file is created in the current working directory (likely the extension's `tools` directory). If it is, it indicates successful command injection.
