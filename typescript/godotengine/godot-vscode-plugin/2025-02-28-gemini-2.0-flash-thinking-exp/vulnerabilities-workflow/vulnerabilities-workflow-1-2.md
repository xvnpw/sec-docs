### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Icon Generation Script
- Description:
    1. The `generate_icons.ts` script, used to generate themed icons for the extension, takes the path to the Godot repository as a command-line argument (`process.argv[2]`).
    2. This `godotPath` is then directly used in `child_process.exec` commands without sufficient sanitization.
    3. An attacker who can influence the arguments passed to this script could inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system shell.
    4. While direct external exploitation of this script in a VSCode extension context is limited, if a vulnerability in the extension allowed an attacker to control or modify the execution environment of this script (e.g., through a malicious workspace or configuration), command injection could be possible.
- Impact:
    - If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine where the VSCode extension is running, with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - This could lead to sensitive data exposure, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in the provided code snippet. The script directly uses `godotPath` in `exec` calls.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of `godotPath` in `generate_icons.ts`.
    - Avoid using `child_process.exec` if possible, or use `child_process.spawn` with arguments array and avoid shell execution.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments passed to the `generate_icons.ts` script execution. This is not directly possible for an external attacker in typical VSCode extension usage, but could become a risk if combined with another vulnerability that allows control over the extension's execution environment or configuration.
- Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/tools/generate_icons.ts`
    2. **Line:** `const godotPath = process.argv[2];` - `godotPath` is directly taken from command line arguments.
    3. **Line:** `const command = `"${godotPath}" --version``;` and similar lines within `run()` function. - `godotPath` is used to construct shell commands without sanitization.
    ```typescript
    async function exec(command) {
    	const { stdout, stderr } = await _exec(command); // Potential command injection here
    	return stdout;
    }

    async function run() {
    	if (godotPath == undefined) {
    		console.log("Please provide the absolute path to your godot repo");
    		return;
    	}

    	const original_cwd = process.cwd();

    	process.chdir(godotPath); // Change working directory to potentially attacker-controlled path

    	const diff = (await exec(git.diff)).trim(); // Command injection risk
    	if (diff) {
    		console.log("There appear to be uncommitted changes in your godot repo");
    		console.log("Revert or stash these changes and try again");
    		return;
    	}

    	const branch = (await exec(git.check_branch)).trim(); // Command injection risk

    	console.log("Gathering Godot 3 icons...");
    	await exec(git.checkout_3); // Command injection risk
    	const g3 = get_icons();

    	console.log("Gathering Godot 4 icons...");
    	await exec(git.checkout_4); // Command injection risk
    	const g4 = get_icons();

    	await exec(git.checkout + branch); // Command injection risk

        ...
    }
    ```

- Security test case:
    - **Warning**: This test case involves executing a script that might be vulnerable to command injection. Run it in a safe testing environment and understand the risks.
    1. Prepare a malicious Godot repository path. For example, create a directory named `test_repo; touch injected.txt;` in a safe location. Note the absolute path to this directory.
    2. Modify the `generate_icons.ts` script locally (if possible, otherwise, conceptually understand the execution flow).
    3. Instead of running the script through `npm`, execute it directly using `ts-node` or compile it to JS and run with Node.js.
    4. When executing the script, pass the malicious path as the `godotPath` argument: `node generate_icons.js "/path/to/test_repo; touch injected.txt;"` (replace `/path/to/test_repo` with the actual path).
    5. Observe if the `injected.txt` file is created in the current working directory. If it is, it indicates successful command injection because the `; touch injected.txt;` part of the path was executed as a shell command after the `chdir` command.
    6. In the context of a VSCode extension, a more realistic (though still theoretical without another vulnerability) scenario would involve a malicious workspace configuration or setting that could somehow influence the `godotPath` used by this script during extension execution (which is not the typical execution path for this script in the extension's runtime).
