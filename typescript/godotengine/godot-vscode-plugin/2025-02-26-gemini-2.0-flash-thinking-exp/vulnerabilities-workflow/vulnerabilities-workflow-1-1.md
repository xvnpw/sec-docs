### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Icon Generation Script
- Description:
    1. An attacker tricks a developer into using a malicious path as the Godot repository path when running the `generate_icons.ts` script.
    2. The developer runs the `generate_icons.ts` script to generate icons for the extension, providing the malicious path as a command-line argument.
    3. The script uses this path as the current working directory for executing Git commands using `child_process.exec`.
    4. Because `child_process.exec` executes commands in a shell, shell commands embedded in the malicious path are executed on the developer's machine. For example, a malicious path like `/tmp/godot_repo; touch PWNED` would execute `touch PWNED`.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine. This can lead to:
    - Data theft from the developer's system.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors.
    - System compromise and potential lateral movement in the developer's network.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the `godotPath` argument in `generate_icons.ts` to ensure it is a valid directory path and does not contain any shell metacharacters or malicious commands.
    - Instead of directly using `child_process.exec` with a potentially user-controlled path, use `child_process.spawn` with explicitly defined arguments for Git commands, avoiding shell execution where possible.
    - Consider using a dedicated Git library for Node.js to further reduce the risk of command injection.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must trick a developer into running the `generate_icons.ts` script with a malicious path.
    - The developer must have `ts-node` installed and execute the script.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/tools/generate_icons.ts`
    - The script retrieves the Godot repository path from command-line arguments using `process.argv[2]` on line 489:
      ```typescript
      const godotPath = process.argv[2];
      ```
    - This `godotPath` is used directly in `child_process.exec` calls without sanitization.
    - The `exec` function (lines 45-48) wraps `child_process.exec`:
      ```typescript
      async function exec(command) {
          const { stdout, stderr } = await _exec(command);
          return stdout;
      }
      ```
    - Git commands are executed using this `exec` function, for example on line 498:
      ```typescript
      const diff = (await exec(git.diff)).trim();
      ```
    - A malicious `godotPath` like `/tmp/pwned; touch PWNED` will cause the script to execute `touch PWNED` due to shell command injection when `child_process.exec` is used.
- Security Test Case:
    1. An attacker crafts instructions to trick a developer into running the icon generation script with a malicious path.
    2. The developer opens a terminal, navigates to the project root, and executes:
       ```bash
       npx ts-node ./code/tools/generate_icons.ts "/tmp/pwned; touch /tmp/PWNED"
       ```
    3. After execution, the attacker checks if the file `/tmp/PWNED` is created on the developer's system.
    4. If `/tmp/PWNED` exists, command injection is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Out-of-bounds read in Variant Decoder
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Godot project that, when debugged, sends a debugger message with a data buffer shorter than 4 bytes to the VSCode extension.
    2. When the extension's `VariantDecoder.get_dataset` function processes this buffer, it attempts to read the buffer length from the first 4 bytes using `buffer.readUInt32LE(0)`.
    3. Because the buffer is shorter than 4 bytes, `buffer.readUInt32LE(0)` reads out of bounds, causing the extension to crash.
- Impact: Crash of the VSCode extension during debugging. This leads to a denial of service of the debugging functionality and a degraded user experience.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement a check at the beginning of `VariantDecoder.get_dataset` to verify if the input buffer is at least 4 bytes long before attempting to read its length.
    - If the buffer is shorter than 4 bytes, handle it gracefully, such as by logging an error and returning `undefined`, instead of proceeding with the out-of-bounds read.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker provides a malicious Godot project to a user for debugging.
    - The user opens this project in VSCode and starts a debugging session, connecting to the malicious Godot debugger.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/debugger/godot3/variables/variant_decoder.ts` (and `/code/src/debugger/godot4/variables/variant_decoder.ts`)
    - Function: `get_dataset`
    - Vulnerable code:
      ```typescript
      public get_dataset(buffer: Buffer) {
          const len = buffer.readUInt32LE(0); // Out-of-bounds read if buffer.length < 4
          if (buffer.length != len + 4) {
              return undefined;
          }
          ...
      }
      ```
    - The code directly reads a UInt32 from the beginning of the buffer without checking its size, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read if the buffer is too short.
- Security Test Case:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Godot project designed to send short debugger messages.
    2. A user opens this project in VSCode and starts a debug session.
    3. During debugging, the malicious Godot project sends a crafted debugger message with a buffer of length less than 4 bytes.
    4. The VSCode extension processes this message using `VariantDecoder.get_dataset`.
    5. The extension crashes due to an out-of-bounds read in `buffer.readUInt32LE(0)`.
    6. The attacker observes the VSCode extension crashing, confirming the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Out-of-bounds read in `split_buffers` function
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Godot project that, when debugged, sends a debugger message containing a buffer with manipulated length prefixes.
    2. The extension's `split_buffers` function processes this buffer to split it into sub-buffers based on the length prefixes.
    3. By crafting malicious length prefixes, the attacker can cause `split_buffers` to attempt to read lengths or create sub-buffers that extend beyond the boundaries of the main buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
    4. This out-of-bounds read causes the VSCode extension to crash.
- Impact: Crash of the VSCode extension during debugging. This results in denial of service of the debugging feature and a negative impact on user experience.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
- Missing Mitigations:
    - In the `split_buffers` function, before reading each sub-buffer length with `buffer.readUInt32LE(offset)`, validate that `offset + 4` is within the bounds of the buffer.
    - Before creating each sub-buffer using `buffer.subarray(offset, offset + subLength)`, verify that `offset + subLength` does not exceed the buffer's length.
    - If any of these boundary checks fail, handle the malformed buffer gracefully, e.g., by logging an error and stopping the buffer splitting process.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker provides a malicious Godot project to a user for debugging.
    - The user opens this project in VSCode and starts a debugging session, connecting to the malicious Godot debugger.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/debugger/godot3/helpers.ts` (and `/code/src/debugger/godot4/helpers.ts`)
    - Function: `split_buffers`
    - Vulnerable code:
      ```typescript
      export function split_buffers(buffer: Buffer) {
          let len = buffer.byteLength;
          let offset = 0;
          const buffers: Buffer[] = [];
          while (len > 0) {
              const subLength = buffer.readUInt32LE(offset) + 4; // Potential OOB read
              buffers.push(buffer.subarray(offset, offset + subLength)); // Potential OOB read
              offset += subLength;
              len -= subLength;
          }
          return buffers;
      }
      ```
    - The loop reads sub-buffer lengths and creates sub-buffers without proper boundary checks, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads if the input buffer is maliciously crafted.
- Security Test Case:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Godot project that sends crafted debugger messages with manipulated length prefixes.
    2. A user opens this project in VSCode and starts debugging.
    3. During debugging, the malicious project sends a debugger message with a buffer where length prefixes are designed to cause an out-of-bounds read in `split_buffers`.
    4. The VSCode extension processes the message using `split_buffers`.
    5. The extension crashes due to an out-of-bounds read, either in `readUInt32LE` or `subarray`.
    6. The attacker observes the crash, confirming the vulnerability.
