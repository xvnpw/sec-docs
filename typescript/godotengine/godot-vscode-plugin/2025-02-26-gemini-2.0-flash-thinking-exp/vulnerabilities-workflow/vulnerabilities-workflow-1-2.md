- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation Webview via Unsanitized URI Fragment  
  **Description:**  
  When a “gddoc” URI is processed, its fragment is embedded without proper escaping into an inline script. An attacker can supply a malicious fragment (for example, using input such as `'); alert('XSS');//`) that escapes the string context and triggers arbitrary JavaScript execution in the webview.  
  **Impact:**  
  Exploitation can lead to arbitrary script execution in the extension’s documentation webview. This may allow attackers to hijack user sessions, access sensitive data, or launch further attacks in the context of the extension.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The fragment is currently interpolated directly into the JavaScript string without any sanitization.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Escape or validate any data coming from the URI fragment before inserting it into inline scripts.  
  - Alternatively, avoid inline code injection by passing the value via secure APIs or using a safe templating system.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply or modify a “gddoc” URI (for example by publishing or distributing a malicious link).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the documentation builder (e.g., in `/code/src/providers/documentation_builder.ts`), the fragment extracted from the URI is directly concatenated into an inline JavaScript snippet that simply scrolls the document into view. No sanitization is applied, so an input such as  
    ```
    '); alert('XSS');//
    ```  
    can break out of the intended context.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Craft a “gddoc” URI such as:  
     ```
     gddoc://path/to/doc#'); alert('XSS');//
     ```  
  2. Open this URI in the extension’s documentation webview.  
  3. Verify that the injected code executes (for example, an alert box appears), indicating a successful XSS attack.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Debug “additional_options” Field  
  **Description:**  
  Both the Godot 3 and Godot 4 debugger workflows construct the command used to launch the game process by concatenating various parameters from the debug configuration. In particular, if the configuration supplies an `additional_options` field, its value is appended directly to the shell command without any sanitization. An attacker who can force a launch configuration (for example, by including one in a public workspace or repository) may supply a payload that includes shell metacharacters, thereby injecting and executing arbitrary shell commands.  
  **Impact:**  
  Successful exploitation may lead to arbitrary shell command execution. This can result in full system compromise, loss of data, or installation of malware.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No filtering or sanitization is performed on the contents of the `additional_options` field.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and sanitize the `additional_options` input to disallow dangerous shell metacharacters.  
  - Consider refactoring the command‐building process to pass arguments as an array (thus bypassing the shell) rather than concatenating strings.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious debug launch configuration (for example, via a malicious repository or workspace file).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In both `/code/src/debugger/godot3/server_controller.ts` and `/code/src/debugger/godot4/server_controller.ts`, the debug command string is built from configuration parameters. When `args.additional_options` is provided, it is added with no encoding or sanitization, so a payload like  
    ```
    ; echo INJECTED; #
    ```  
    would be appended to the command and executed by the shell.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create a launch configuration (launch.json) that sets `additional_options` to a payload such as:  
     ```
     ; echo INJECTED; #
     ```  
  2. Launch a debug session using this configuration.  
  3. Monitor the system’s terminal or log output for evidence that the injected command (e.g. printing “INJECTED”) was executed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal / Arbitrary File Read via Unsanitized Resource Paths  
  **Description:**  
  To convert a “res://” resource path into a local file system URI, the extension removes the “res://” prefix and joins the remainder with the project directory. No normalization or checks are performed on the remaining path, allowing an attacker to include directory traversal sequences (such as `../`). This can cause the resulting path to point to files outside of the project directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker may be able to trick the extension into reading arbitrary files (such as sensitive configuration files or system files) located outside the intended directory. This may result in severe information disclosure.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The conversion function (e.g., in `/code/src/utils/project_utils.ts`) simply performs a string manipulation without validating that the final path remains within the project’s boundaries.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Normalize the resultant path and then verify that it falls under the project directory boundary.  
  - Reject or appropriately sanitize any resource path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be able to supply or commit a malicious resource path (for example, in a scene or resource file within a public repository).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the resource path conversion code (in `/code/src/utils/project_utils.ts`), the function strips off “res://” and then uses a simple join with the project directory. Without proper path normalization, a supplied value like  
    ```
    res://../../../../etc/passwd
    ```  
    will resolve to a location outside the intended directory, allowing unauthorized file access.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test or controlled malicious repository, include a resource reference with a path such as:  
     ```
     res://../secret.txt
     ```  
     where “secret.txt” exists outside the project folder.  
  2. Trigger functionality that loads or previews the referenced resource.  
  3. Confirm that the contents of the file outside the workspace (i.e. “secret.txt”) are read or displayed by the extension.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Debug Server Socket  
  **Description:**  
  The extension sets up a debug server by creating a Node.js network socket (using `net.createServer`) and binding it to an address and port as specified in the launch configuration. No authentication or encryption is implemented on this socket. This means that any entity that can access the network interface on which the server is bound may connect and send debug commands that are subsequently interpreted by the extension.  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker with network access to the debug server could inject arbitrary debug commands. This could result in manipulation of the debug session (for example, altering breakpoints, stopping or continuing execution, or changing variable states) and may lead to sensitive debug information disclosure or further compromise of the target system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Neither authentication nor encryption is implemented. The server listens on `args.address` and `args.port` and processes all incoming data directly through `socket.on("data", …)`.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Implement authentication and authorization on the debug server socket to ensure that only trusted/debugging clients can connect.  
  - Restrict the binding to localhost (127.0.0.1) when remote debugging is not explicitly required.  
  - Optionally, deploy TLS encryption on the communication channel and validate the origin of incoming messages.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The debug server must be bound to an externally accessible network interface (for example, using a misconfigured `args.address` such as `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`).  
  - The attacker must have network access to the host machine’s debug port.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/debugger/godot4/server_controller.ts` (and similarly in the Godot 3 controller), the code calls:  
    ```ts
    this.server = net.createServer((socket) => { … });
    this.server.listen(args.port, args.address);
    ```  
    Once a connection is made, incoming data are processed without verifying the identity or origin of the sender. The absence of any checks means that if this port is exposed beyond localhost, an unauthorized party can send properly formatted debug commands that the extension will obey.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Configure a debug launch with its network parameter (args.address) set to a publicly accessible interface (for example, `0.0.0.0`).  
  2. From an external system (or another terminal on the same machine if the port is publicly reachable), connect to the specified debug port using a network tool such as netcat (`nc`).  
  3. Send a payload that mimics a valid debug command (properly encoded using the extension’s VariantEncoder/Decoder format), for example a “debug_enter” command.  
  4. Verify that the debug session processes the injected command—such as by observing altered debugger state, output messages, or breakpoints—thus confirming that the socket accepts unauthenticated input.
