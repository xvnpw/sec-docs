# sec-docs
Security documentation for important Open Source Software (OSS) projects, generated using LLM technology.

The documentation includes:
- üîç Attack surface analysis
- üå≥ Attack trees
- üîí Security design reviews
- üéØ Threat modeling

## How to Navigate This Repository

**sec-docs** is organized by programming language, with folders for each major OSS project. Each project contains subfolders with detailed analyses performed at a specific date using a certain LLM model.

## Support **sec-docs**

**sec-docs** is an ambitious initiative aimed at enhancing the security of open-source software through AI-powered documentation. We need your support to continue and expand our analysis of major OSS projects.

### Why Your Support Matters

Open-source software drives much of the technology we rely on daily. However, inadequate security documentation leaves these projects vulnerable. **sec-docs** bridges this gap by:

- **Automatic Analysis:** Using advanced AI models to create tailored, comprehensive security documentation.
- **Simplifying Security:** Making complex security concepts understandable and actionable for developers.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Keeping documentation current as code evolves.

Your support enables more developers to build safer applications and strengthens trust in open-source ecosystems.

### The Cost of Innovation

Generating security documentation for just one project requires over **dozens of thousands of tokens**, costing around **~$15** per project. These expenses are incurred through:

1. **AI Model Access:** API calls and subscriptions to premium LLM services.

### How You Can Make a Difference

Your contributions will fuel the expansion of **sec-docs**, bringing vital security resources to more OSS projects. Together, we can enhance the security landscape of open-source software.

**Ways to Support:**
- **GitHub Sponsors:** Become a sponsor and directly support our ongoing efforts at [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xvnpw).

### Thank You

Your support is crucial to our mission and greatly appreciated by the global open-source community. Together, let's make open-source software safer, one project at a time.
