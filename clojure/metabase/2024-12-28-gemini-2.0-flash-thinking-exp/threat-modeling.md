Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve Metabase:

*   **Threat:** Weak Metabase Instance Authentication
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to use default credentials or brute-force login attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Metabase instance. They could then leverage administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over Metabase, including access to sensitive database credentials, ability to execute arbitrary queries, modify data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication System, User Management Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Metabase users.
        *   Disable or change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

*   **Threat:** Insecure API Key Management
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Metabase's API, an attacker might try to find and exploit insecurely stored or transmitted API keys. This could involve inspecting application code, network traffic, or configuration files related to how the application interacts with Metabase's API.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to perform actions on the Metabase API as the authorized application, potentially leading to data retrieval, modification, or deletion within Metabase.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Endpoints, API Key Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application code.
        *   Implement proper access controls and rate limiting for API usage within Metabase.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Use HTTPS for all API communication with Metabase.

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Application's Authorization through Direct Metabase Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to bypass the application's intended authorization flow by directly accessing the Metabase instance if it's not properly secured or isolated. This directly exploits Metabase's accessibility.
    *   **Impact:** Access to data and functionalities within Metabase that the application's authorization logic was designed to restrict.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication System, Network Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict network access to the Metabase instance to only authorized sources (e.g., the application server).
        *   Ensure Metabase's authentication is independent and robust, not solely relying on the application's authentication.
        *   Consider embedding Metabase elements securely rather than providing direct access to the Metabase UI.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials within Metabase
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Metabase instance could potentially retrieve stored database connection details (usernames, passwords, connection strings) managed by Metabase.
    *   **Impact:** Direct access to the underlying databases, potentially leading to significant data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database Connection Management, Metadata Storage
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt database connection details stored within Metabase.
        *   Limit access to the Metabase instance itself.
        *   Regularly review and rotate database credentials.
        *   Consider using read-only database accounts for Metabase where appropriate.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Metabase's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Metabase relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Metabase instance itself.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service affecting the Metabase instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Application, Third-Party Libraries
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Metabase updated to the latest version, which includes security patches for dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan Metabase and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for promptly patching vulnerabilities in Metabase.

*   **Threat:** Risks Associated with Public Sharing of Metabase Items
    *   **Description:** If Metabase's public sharing features are used without careful consideration, sensitive data managed and displayed by Metabase could be unintentionally exposed to the public.
    *   **Impact:** Public disclosure of confidential information, potentially leading to reputational damage or legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sharing Features, Public Links
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using public sharing features within Metabase.
        *   Ensure that only non-sensitive data is shared publicly through Metabase.
        *   Use expiring public links and regularly review shared items in Metabase.
        *   Consider alternative methods for sharing data securely.

*   **Threat:** Security Implications of Metabase Extensions/Plugins
    *   **Description:** If Metabase allows extensions or plugins, vulnerabilities in these extensions could introduce new attack vectors directly into the Metabase instance. Malicious extensions could be installed to compromise the system.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities within Metabase.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extensions/Plugins System
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install trusted and verified extensions within Metabase.
        *   Keep extensions updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement controls to restrict the installation of unauthorized extensions in Metabase.
        *   Regularly review installed extensions for potential vulnerabilities.
