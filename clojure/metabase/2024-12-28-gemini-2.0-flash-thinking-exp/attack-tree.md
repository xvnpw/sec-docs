**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Metabase Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the specific version of Metabase being used. They then attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially gaining remote code execution, bypassing authentication, or performing server-side request forgery.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (if vulnerabilities exist in the deployed version)
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Critical Node:** **Exploit Known Metabase Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**, **Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement a robust patching process:** Regularly update Metabase to the latest stable version.
    * **Monitor security advisories:** Subscribe to Metabase's security mailing list and other relevant sources.
    * **Vulnerability scanning:** Regularly scan the Metabase instance for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common exploit attempts.

**2. Abuse Metabase Functionality for Malicious Purposes (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage legitimate features of Metabase in unintended and malicious ways.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement strong input validation and sanitization:** Prevent the injection of malicious code or SQL.
    * **Enforce the principle of least privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions within Metabase.
    * **Regularly audit Metabase user roles and permissions.**
    * **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.**

    * **2.1 SQL Injection via Metabase [CRITICAL]:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries through Metabase's query builder or exploit vulnerabilities in Metabase's SQL generation logic to directly interact with the underlying database.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (if input validation is weak)
        * **Impact:** High (database compromise)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Parameterized queries:** Ensure Metabase uses parameterized queries where possible.
            * **Strict input validation:** Sanitize user inputs used in custom queries.
            * **Regular security testing:** Specifically test the query builder for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

    * **2.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Metabase:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into Metabase dashboards or questions, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (if input sanitization is weak)
        * **Impact:** Medium (session hijacking, data theft)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Strict output encoding:** Encode all user-generated content displayed by Metabase.
            * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources.
            * **Regular security testing:** Test for XSS vulnerabilities in Metabase's UI.

    * **2.3 Privilege Escalation within Metabase [CRITICAL]:** Attackers exploit flaws in Metabase's permission model or abuse features intended for administrators to gain unauthorized access to higher-level privileges and functionalities.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        * **Impact:** High (full control over Metabase)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Regularly review and audit Metabase's user roles and permissions.**
            * **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions.
            * **Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.**

**3. Compromise Metabase Instance Directly (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly target the Metabase server infrastructure or the Metabase application itself to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Harden the Metabase server infrastructure:** Secure the operating system, network configurations, and access controls.
    * **Implement strong authentication and authorization:** Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for Metabase administrators.
    * **Regular security audits and penetration testing of the Metabase infrastructure.**
    * **Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).**

    * **3.1 Gain Access to Metabase Server/Infrastructure [CRITICAL]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or infrastructure, or brute-force/compromise Metabase administrator credentials to gain direct access to the server.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (if strong passwords and MFA are used, and server is hardened)
        * **Impact:** High (full server compromise)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Regularly patch the operating system and other server software.**
            * **Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication.**
            * **Restrict access to the Metabase server using firewalls and access control lists.**
            * **Monitor for suspicious login attempts.**

    * **3.2 Brute-force or compromise Metabase administrator credentials [CRITICAL]:** Attackers attempt to guess or crack administrator passwords to gain full control over the Metabase instance.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (with strong passwords and MFA)
        * **Impact:** High (full control over Metabase)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Enforce strong password policies.**
            * **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).**
            * **Account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.**
            * **Monitor for suspicious login activity.**

    * **3.3 Compromise Metabase Configuration [CRITICAL]:** Attackers gain access to Metabase's configuration files or manipulate environment variables to alter its behavior, potentially disabling security features or exposing sensitive information.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (requires server access)
        * **Impact:** High (can disable security features, expose credentials)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**

        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on storage security)
        * **Impact:** High (direct database access)
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Encrypt database credentials stored by Metabase.**
            * **Restrict access to Metabase's internal data storage.**
