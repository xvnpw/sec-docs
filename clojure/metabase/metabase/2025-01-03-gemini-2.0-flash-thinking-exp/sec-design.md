**4. System Overview**

Metabase is a web-based business intelligence (BI) tool enabling users to explore data, create visualizations, and build dashboards. The system comprises these key components:

*   **User Interface (Frontend):** The primary interface for user interaction, handling login, data exploration, query building, visualization creation, and dashboard management.
*   **API (Backend):** A RESTful API serving as the communication layer between the frontend and the core application logic, managing requests and responses.
*   **Query Processor:**  A more descriptive name for the component responsible for translating user-defined queries into executable commands for various data sources.
*   **Metadata Repository:**  The central store for Metabase's internal data, including user information, saved queries, dashboards, and connection details.
*   **Data Source Connectors:**  Specialized modules facilitating communication with diverse external data sources.
*   **Caching Mechanism:**  An optional layer to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed query results.
*   **Scheduling Service:**  Manages the execution of time-based tasks, such as scheduled reports and data refreshes.
