# Attack Surface Analysis for metabase/metabase

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Metabase's login process to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Metabase Contributes:** Metabase's internal authentication mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities in password reset flows, or weaknesses in handling Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations if not configured correctly.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a flaw in Metabase's login logic to bypass password verification or manipulating a vulnerable SSO configuration to gain access without proper credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, dashboards, and potentially administrative functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements for Metabase users.
        *   Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators.
        *   Regularly review and audit SSO configurations to ensure they are securely implemented.
        *   Keep Metabase updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using an external authentication provider and properly configuring Metabase's authentication settings.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation within Metabase](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_within_metabase.md)

*   **Description:** A user with limited permissions gains access to resources or functionalities they are not intended to have.
    *   **How Metabase Contributes:** Metabase's permission system, potential flaws in how permissions are assigned, enforced, or inherited, and vulnerabilities in administrative functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A user with "viewer" permissions manipulates API calls or exploits a vulnerability in the permission model to gain access to edit or delete data sources or dashboards.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of data, dashboards, or settings; access to sensitive information beyond the user's intended scope.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to Metabase users and groups.
        *   Regularly review and audit Metabase's permission settings and user roles.
        *   Ensure administrative functions are restricted to authorized personnel only.
        *   Keep Metabase updated to patch potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Shared Links and Embeds](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_shared_links_and_embeds.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is unintentionally exposed through publicly shared dashboards or embedded Metabase visualizations.
    *   **How Metabase Contributes:** Metabase's features for sharing dashboards via public links and embedding visualizations in external applications. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the generation and handling of these links and embeds.
    *   **Example:** A public share link for a dashboard containing sensitive financial data is accidentally shared widely or is guessable due to a weak link generation mechanism. An embedded dashboard is not properly secured within the embedding application, allowing unauthorized access to the data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential or sensitive information to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise caution when sharing dashboards publicly. Understand the implications and potential risks.
        *   Utilize signed embedding or other secure embedding methods that require authentication.
        *   Regularly review and audit publicly shared links and embedded dashboards.
        *   Educate users on the risks associated with public sharing and embedding.
        *   Consider disabling public sharing if it's not a required feature.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Metabase JAR](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_metabase_jar.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to the unsafe deserialization of Java objects within the Metabase application.
    *   **How Metabase Contributes:** Metabase is a Java application that might use deserialization for certain functionalities. If not handled securely, it can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Java object and sends it to the Metabase server, which, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Metabase server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Metabase updated to the latest version, as updates often include patches for deserialization vulnerabilities in underlying libraries.
        *   If possible, disable or minimize the use of Java deserialization within Metabase.
        *   Implement security measures like input validation and whitelisting to prevent the processing of malicious serialized objects.
