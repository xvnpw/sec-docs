## Deep Dive Analysis: Privilege Escalation within Metabase

This document provides a deep dive analysis of the "Privilege Escalation within Metabase" threat, as described in the provided threat model. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential attack vectors, and actionable recommendations for the development team.

**1. Detailed Threat Analysis:**

This threat focuses on the potential for a user with limited privileges in Metabase to gain access to functionalities and data they are not intended to access. This exploitation targets vulnerabilities within Metabase's own role-based access control (RBAC) system, rather than external vulnerabilities.

**Key Aspects of the Threat:**

* **Attacker Profile:** The attacker is an authenticated user within the Metabase instance, possessing a legitimate but low-privileged account. Their motivation is to gain unauthorized access, potentially for data exfiltration, modification, or disruption.
* **Vulnerability Location:** The core vulnerability lies within the logic and implementation of Metabase's RBAC system and permission management modules. This could involve flaws in:
    * **Permission Assignment Logic:** Errors in how permissions are assigned, inherited, or enforced based on roles and groups.
    * **Authorization Checks:** Insufficient or flawed checks performed before granting access to resources or functionalities.
    * **Input Validation:** Lack of proper sanitization and validation of user inputs related to permission requests or modifications.
    * **API Endpoints:** Vulnerabilities in the API endpoints responsible for managing roles, permissions, and access control.
    * **Session Management:** Weaknesses in session handling that could allow for session manipulation or hijacking to gain higher privileges.
    * **Data Model Security:** Issues in how the underlying data model and its metadata are secured, potentially allowing manipulation of permission-related data.
* **Attack Vectors (Potential Scenarios):**
    * **Direct Object Reference Exploitation:**  Manipulating identifiers (IDs) of resources (e.g., dashboards, questions, collections) in API requests to access or modify objects they shouldn't have access to. For example, a user might guess or enumerate IDs of sensitive dashboards and bypass permission checks.
    * **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying request parameters related to permissions or resource access to bypass authorization checks. This could involve altering values in API calls or form submissions.
    * **SQL Injection (if applicable to permission checks):** While Metabase likely has safeguards, if permission checks involve dynamic SQL queries, there's a risk of SQL injection to manipulate the query and bypass access controls.
    * **Logic Flaws in Permission Evaluation:** Exploiting bugs in the code that evaluates user permissions. This could involve finding specific sequences of actions or conditions that lead to incorrect permission granting.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging vulnerabilities in the Metabase API endpoints responsible for managing roles and permissions. This could include issues like missing authorization checks, insecure default configurations, or vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the API.
    * **Race Conditions:** Exploiting timing vulnerabilities in permission checks, where a user might attempt to perform an action while their permissions are being updated, potentially gaining temporary elevated access.
    * **Session Hijacking/Replay:** If session management is weak, an attacker might be able to hijack a session of a higher-privileged user or replay previous requests with elevated privileges.
    * **Metadata Manipulation:**  In some scenarios, if the underlying data model storing permission information is not adequately protected, an attacker might attempt to directly manipulate this metadata to grant themselves higher privileges.
    * **Exploiting Default Configurations:**  If Metabase has insecure default configurations for roles or permissions, an attacker might be able to leverage these to gain unintended access.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Integrations:** If Metabase integrates with other systems for authentication or authorization, vulnerabilities in these integrations could be exploited to elevate privileges within Metabase.

**2. Impact Analysis (Expanded):**

The impact of successful privilege escalation extends beyond simply accessing unauthorized data. Consider these potential consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Accessing and potentially exfiltrating sensitive business data, customer information, or financial records stored within Metabase or connected databases.
* **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting critical data, leading to inaccurate reporting, flawed decision-making, or even operational disruptions.
* **Unauthorized Functionality Execution:** Accessing administrative functionalities like user management, database connections, or application settings, allowing the attacker to further compromise the system.
* **System Disruption:**  Potentially disrupting the availability or functionality of Metabase for legitimate users. This could involve deleting dashboards, altering settings, or even causing the application to crash.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach involving privilege escalation can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode trust with customers and stakeholders.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, resulting in significant fines and legal repercussions.
* **Lateral Movement:**  A compromised Metabase instance could be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems and resources within the organization's network.

**3. Affected Components (Detailed Breakdown):**

* **Metabase's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System:** This is the primary target. Analysis should focus on:
    * **Role Definition and Management:** How roles are created, defined, and assigned permissions.
    * **User and Group Management:** How users are added to groups and assigned roles.
    * **Permission Inheritance:** How permissions are inherited through roles and groups.
    * **Resource-Level Permissions:** How permissions are applied to specific dashboards, questions, collections, and data sources.
    * **API Endpoints for RBAC Management:**  The security of the API endpoints used to manage roles and permissions.
* **Permission Management Modules:** This includes the code and logic responsible for:
    * **Authentication and Authorization Checks:**  The mechanisms that verify user identity and grant access based on permissions.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  How user inputs related to permissions are handled.
    * **Session Management:** How user sessions are created, maintained, and invalidated.
    * **Logging and Auditing:**  The mechanisms for tracking permission-related activities.
* **Metabase's Data Model and Metadata Storage:**  The underlying database and its schema that store information about users, roles, permissions, and resources. The security of this data is crucial.
* **Metabase's API:**  The application programming interface that exposes functionalities related to data access, visualization, and administration. Vulnerabilities in the API can be exploited for privilege escalation.
* **User Interface (UI):** While less direct, vulnerabilities in the UI could potentially be used to manipulate requests or bypass client-side validation related to permissions.

**4. Risk Severity Justification:**

The "High" risk severity is appropriate due to the significant potential impact of this threat. Successful exploitation could lead to:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data.
