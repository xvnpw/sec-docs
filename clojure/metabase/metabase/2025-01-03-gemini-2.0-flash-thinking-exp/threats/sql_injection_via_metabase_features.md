## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Metabase Features

This document provides a deep analysis of the "SQL Injection via Metabase Features" threat, as outlined in the provided threat model. We will delve into the mechanics of this vulnerability, explore potential attack vectors, elaborate on the impact, and provide detailed, actionable mitigation strategies for the development team.

**1. Understanding the Threat:**

The core of this threat lies in the potential for untrusted data to influence the construction and execution of SQL queries within Metabase. While Metabase aims to abstract away direct SQL interaction for many users, its powerful features like custom SQL queries, filtering, and variables introduce points where attackers can inject malicious SQL code if the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize user input.

**Key Concepts:**

* **SQL Injection:** A code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in the database layer of an application. Attackers insert malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database content to the attacker).
* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** A method of executing SQL queries where the query structure is defined separately from the actual data values. Placeholders are used for data, which are then bound to the query separately. This prevents the database from interpreting data as executable code.
* **Input Validation:** The process of ensuring that user-provided input conforms to expected formats, data types, and lengths. This helps prevent unexpected or malicious data from being processed.
* **Sanitization:** The process of modifying user-provided input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or code. This can involve escaping special characters or removing entire code segments.

**2. Deep Dive into Potential Attack Vectors:**

Let's examine specific Metabase features that could be exploited:

* **Custom SQL Queries:** This is the most obvious attack vector. If a user with the "write" permission for custom SQL can directly input SQL, and Metabase doesn't properly parameterize this input before sending it to the connected database, they can inject arbitrary SQL.

    * **Example:** Instead of a legitimate query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{user_id}}`, an attacker could input:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users; --
      ```
      If `{{user_id}}` is not properly handled, the database might execute `DROP TABLE users;`.

* **Filters:**  Metabase allows users to create filters on dashboards and questions. If these filter values are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, they become injection points.

    * **Example:** A filter on a "username" field might allow an attacker to input:
      ```
      ' OR 1=1; SELECT pg_sleep(10); --
      ```
      This could bypass the intended filter and potentially execute a time-based blind SQL injection.

* **Variables:** Variables in Metabase provide dynamic values for queries. If these variable values are not treated as untrusted input and are directly inserted into SQL, they are vulnerable.

    * **Example:** A variable named `order_by_column` could be exploited by setting its value to:
      ```
      id; DROP TABLE orders; --
      ```
      If the query uses this variable like `ORDER BY {{order_by_column}}`, the attacker's SQL could be executed.

* **Nested Queries and Functions:**  Even within seemingly safe Metabase features, if the underlying logic involves constructing SQL based on user input, vulnerabilities can arise. This includes how Metabase handles nested queries or utilizes database-specific functions.

* **API Endpoints:**  While not directly a "feature," Metabase exposes API endpoints for creating and managing questions, dashboards, and settings. If these endpoints accept user-controlled data that is used to construct SQL queries on the backend, they can be exploited.

**3. Technical Details of the Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the following technical shortcomings:

* **Lack of Parameterized Queries:** If Metabase uses string concatenation or similar methods to build SQL queries with user-provided data, it's highly susceptible to SQL injection. Parameterized queries are the primary defense against this.
* **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Metabase needs to rigorously validate and sanitize all user input that could potentially influence SQL query construction. This includes checking data types, lengths, and escaping special characters.
* **Over-Reliance on Database Permissions:** While database permissions are crucial, they are not a substitute for secure coding practices within Metabase. An attacker who gains access through SQL injection can often bypass these permissions.
* **Complex Query Building Logic:** The more complex the logic Metabase uses to generate SQL based on user actions, the higher the chance of introducing vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented.

**4. Elaborating on the Impact:**

The potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack on a Metabase instance is significant and can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach and Exfiltration:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the connected databases, including customer information, financial records, and intellectual property. They can then exfiltrate this data for malicious purposes.
* **Data Modification and Corruption:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, and potential legal liabilities.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, attackers can use SQL injection to escalate their privileges within the database, potentially gaining administrative control.
* **Command Execution on the Database Server:** Depending on the database system and its configuration, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying database server, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive queries to overload the database server, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised database server is connected to other internal systems, attackers might be able to use it as a stepping stone to further compromise the network.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from SQL injection can lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc., resulting in significant fines and penalties.

**5. Root Cause Analysis:**

The underlying reasons for this vulnerability can often be traced back to:

* **Insecure Development Practices:** Lack of awareness or adherence to secure coding principles within the development team.
* **Insufficient Security Testing:**  Failure to adequately test Metabase's features for SQL injection vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.
* **Complexity of the Application:** The inherent complexity of a data visualization and querying tool like Metabase can make it challenging to ensure all code paths are secure.
* **Evolution of Features:** New features added to Metabase might introduce new attack surfaces if not implemented with security in mind.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:** While the focus is on Metabase itself, vulnerabilities in underlying libraries or frameworks used by Metabase could also contribute to this threat.

**6. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable):**

The development team should implement a multi-layered approach to mitigate this threat:

* **Mandatory Use of Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective defense against SQL injection. **All database interactions within Metabase, especially those involving user-provided data, MUST use parameterized queries.**  This includes:
    * **Custom SQL Queries:**  Ensure that user-provided parts of the query (e.g., filter values, variable values) are bound as parameters, not directly concatenated into the SQL string.
    * **Filter Logic:** When constructing SQL based on user-defined filters, use parameterized queries to insert the filter values.
    * **Variable Handling:** Treat variable values as untrusted input and use parameterized queries when incorporating them into SQL.
    * **Internal Metabase Logic:**  Review and refactor any internal Metabase code that constructs SQL queries to ensure parameterized queries are used consistently.

    **Example (Conceptual):**

    **Instead of:**
    ```python
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    ```

    **Use:**
    ```python
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    ```

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation for all user-provided data that could influence SQL query construction. This includes:
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    * **Length Restrictions:** Limit the length of input fields to prevent excessively long or malicious inputs.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters or patterns for input fields and reject anything that doesn't conform.
    * **Sanitization (with Caution):**  While parameterized queries are preferred, in specific scenarios where direct SQL manipulation is unavoidable (though these should be minimized), carefully sanitize input by escaping special characters that have meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes). **However, be extremely cautious with sanitization as it can be error-prone and easily bypassed.**
    * **Contextual Validation:** Validate input based on the context in which it's being used. For example, if a variable is expected to be a column name, validate that it exists in the database schema.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user Metabase uses has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. Avoid granting overly broad permissions that could be exploited if SQL injection occurs.

* **Regular Security Testing and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing specifically focused on identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities in Metabase's features. This should be performed by both internal security teams and reputable external security experts.

* **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:** Utilize static application security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan the Metabase codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools to test the running application for these flaws.

* **Security Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory security code reviews for all code changes, especially those related to query building, filtering, and variable handling. Ensure that reviewers are trained to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

* **Security Training for Developers:** Provide regular security training to the development team, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, and secure coding practices to prevent them.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF in front of the Metabase instance to detect and block common SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specific to Metabase's expected traffic patterns.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, a properly configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can sometimes be chained with SQL injection attacks.

* **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Metabase and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Monitor security advisories and promptly apply necessary updates.

* **Input Encoding and Output Encoding:** Ensure that data is properly encoded when it's displayed to users to prevent other types of injection attacks like XSS.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of all database interactions, including the queries executed and the user who initiated them. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity that could indicate a SQL injection attempt.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

Implement mechanisms to detect and monitor for potential SQL injection attempts:

* **Database Audit Logs:** Enable and regularly review database audit logs for unusual or suspicious SQL queries.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:** Monitor WAF logs for blocked SQL injection attempts.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS rules to detect common SQL injection patterns in network traffic.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** Integrate logs from various sources (Metabase, database, WAF, etc.) into a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual database activity that might indicate a successful or attempted SQL injection.

**8. Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Secure by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
* **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against SQL injection.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Metabase application and its infrastructure.

**9. Communication and Collaboration:**

Open communication and collaboration between the development team and security experts are crucial for effectively addressing this threat. Share knowledge, discuss potential vulnerabilities, and work together to implement robust mitigation strategies.

**Conclusion:**

SQL Injection via Metabase Features is a serious threat that requires immediate and ongoing attention. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and fostering a security-conscious development culture, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited. The focus should be on prioritizing parameterized queries, implementing strict input validation, and conducting thorough security testing. Continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are essential to protect the application and its valuable data.
