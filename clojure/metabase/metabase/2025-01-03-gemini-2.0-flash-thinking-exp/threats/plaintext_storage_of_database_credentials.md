## Deep Analysis of Threat: Plaintext Storage of Database Credentials in Metabase

This document provides a deep analysis of the threat "Plaintext Storage of Database Credentials" within the context of a Metabase application. We will dissect the threat, explore its implications, and elaborate on the proposed mitigation strategies, offering actionable insights for the development team.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Elaboration:**

**1.1. Description Deep Dive:**

The core of this threat lies in the insecure storage of sensitive database connection information. While the provided description is accurate, we can expand on the potential locations and forms this insecure storage might take:

* **Metabase Application Configuration Files:**
    * **`application.yml` (or similar):** This is a primary configuration file where connection details might be directly entered in plaintext. This is a highly vulnerable scenario.
    * **Database-specific configuration files:**  Metabase might have separate configuration sections or files for different database types, potentially containing credentials.
    * **Embedded H2 database (default for some deployments):** While not directly a "connected" database, if Metabase stores *its own* connection details in plaintext within its internal H2 database, this presents a risk.
* **Internal Metabase Database (if used for connection details):**
    * Metabase utilizes a database (often PostgreSQL, MySQL, or H2) to store its metadata, including potentially connection details for connected databases. If these credentials are not properly encrypted *within* this internal database, they become a prime target.
    *  The specific tables and columns storing this information would need to be identified and secured.
* **Environment Variables (Insecure Usage):**
    * While using environment variables is a step up from hardcoding in configuration files, they are still vulnerable if the environment itself is compromised.
    * **Directly exposing environment variables:** If the server's environment variables are easily accessible (e.g., through server logs, process listings, or vulnerabilities in the hosting environment), the credentials are still effectively in plaintext.
    * **Lack of proper access controls:** If the environment where Metabase runs doesn't have strict access controls, an attacker gaining access to the server could potentially view these variables.
* **Memory Dumps:** In certain scenarios, if Metabase processes are compromised, memory dumps could potentially reveal plaintext credentials if they are held in memory without proper protection.
* **Backup Files:** Backups of the Metabase server or its internal database could inadvertently contain plaintext credentials if the underlying storage mechanisms are not secure.

**1.2. Attacker Scenarios:**

Let's consider how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability:

* **Server Compromise:**  An attacker gains access to the Metabase server through various means (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server, or Metabase itself; using stolen credentials; social engineering). Once inside, they can explore the filesystem and configuration files.
* **Database Compromise (Internal Metabase DB):** If Metabase's internal database is compromised due to weak security practices, the attacker can directly query the tables containing connection details.
* **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with access to the Metabase server or its configuration files could easily retrieve the plaintext credentials.
* **Supply Chain Attack:** If a compromised dependency or plugin used by Metabase gains access to the application's environment, it could potentially extract credentials.

**2. Impact Deep Dive:**

The impact of this threat extends beyond the immediate compromise of connected databases:

* **Full Compromise of Connected Databases:** This is the most direct and severe impact. Attackers gain full control over the connected databases, allowing them to:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data, including customer information, financial records, intellectual property, etc.
    * **Data Modification:** Alter data, potentially leading to incorrect reporting, business disruption, and even legal repercussions.
    * **Data Deletion:** Permanently delete crucial data, causing significant business damage.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Use the compromised database credentials to access other systems or resources within the organization's network.
* **Unauthorized Access, Modification, or Deletion of Sensitive Data:** This reiterates the core consequence of database compromise, emphasizing the direct impact on data integrity and confidentiality.
* **Potential for Further Attacks Leveraging the Compromised Database:** A compromised database can become a launching pad for further attacks:
    * **Lateral Movement:** Attackers can use the database server as a stepping stone to access other systems on the network.
    * **Planting Backdoors:**  Attackers can create new user accounts or modify stored procedures to maintain persistent access.
    * **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** The compromised database server could be used to launch attacks against other targets.
    * **Data Encryption/Ransomware:** Attackers could encrypt the database and demand a ransom for its recovery.
* **Reputational Damage:** A data breach resulting from this vulnerability can severely damage the organization's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and business.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Depending on the nature of the data compromised, the organization may face significant fines and legal action due to non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Business Disruption:** The process of recovering from a database compromise can lead to significant downtime and disruption of business operations.

**3. Affected Component Analysis:**

Let's delve deeper into the affected components:

* **Metabase Application Configuration Files:**
    * **Specific Files:**  Identifying the exact configuration files where connection details might be stored is crucial. This could include `application.yml`, environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `application-production.yml`), or custom configuration files.
    * **File Permissions:** Even if credentials are encrypted, weak file permissions on these configuration files could allow unauthorized access.
    * **Version Control:**  Care must be taken to avoid committing plaintext credentials to version control systems.
* **Internal Metabase Database (if used for connection details):**
    * **Database Type:** Understanding the type of database Metabase uses internally is essential for assessing its security features and potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Table Structure:** Identifying the specific tables and columns where connection details are stored is necessary for implementing targeted security measures.
    * **Access Controls:**  Robust access controls on the internal Metabase database are critical to prevent unauthorized access.
    * **Encryption at Rest:**  Ensuring the internal database itself is encrypted at rest is a fundamental security practice.
* **Environment Variables (if not securely managed by Metabase's deployment):**
    * **Deployment Environment:** The security of environment variables heavily depends on the deployment environment (e.g., cloud platform, container orchestration).
    * **Access Control Mechanisms:**  Properly configured access controls within the deployment environment are crucial to restrict who can view or modify environment variables.
    * **Secrets Management Integration:**  The absence of integration with dedicated secrets management solutions increases the risk associated with using environment variables.

**4. Risk Severity Justification:**

The "Critical" risk severity is justified due to the following factors:

* **High Likelihood of Exploitation:**  Plaintext storage of credentials is a well-known and easily exploitable vulnerability. Attackers actively scan for such weaknesses.
* **Significant Impact:** As detailed above, the impact of a successful exploit is severe, potentially leading to full database compromise, data breaches, and significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Ease of Discovery:** Plaintext credentials are trivial to find for an attacker who has gained access to the affected components.
* **Widespread Applicability:** This vulnerability can affect any Metabase deployment that doesn't implement proper credential management.

**5. Mitigation Strategies - Enhanced Recommendations:**

Let's expand on the proposed mitigation strategies with practical implementation details:

* **Implement Strong Encryption for Database Credentials at Rest within Metabase:**
    * **Metabase Built-in Encryption:** Investigate if Metabase offers built-in features for encrypting connection details within its configuration or internal database. If so, ensure it is properly configured and utilizes strong encryption algorithms.
    * **Encryption Libraries:** If built-in features are insufficient, explore using encryption libraries within the Metabase application to encrypt credentials before storing them. This would require code changes and careful key management.
    * **Key Management:** Securely manage the encryption keys. Avoid storing keys alongside the encrypted data. Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services.
* **Utilize Secrets Management Solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) integrated with Metabase:**
    * **Integration Methods:** Research Metabase's supported methods for integrating with secrets management solutions. This might involve configuration settings, plugins, or custom development.
    * **Centralized Secrets Management:**  Secrets managers provide a centralized and secure way to store, access, and manage sensitive credentials.
    * **Access Control Policies:** Implement granular access control policies within the secrets manager to restrict access to the database credentials.
    * **Auditing and Rotation:** Leverage the auditing and secret rotation features of secrets managers to enhance security.
* **Avoid Storing Credentials Directly in Configuration Files; Use Environment Variables or Dedicated Secrets Storage with Appropriate Access Controls enforced by the deployment environment and Metabase configuration:**
    * **Prioritize Secrets Managers:** While environment variables are better than plaintext in config files, dedicated secrets managers offer a superior security posture.
    * **Secure Environment Variable Management:** If using environment variables, ensure the deployment environment provides robust access controls and consider using techniques like container secrets or platform-specific secrets management features.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to access secrets, both within the deployment environment and within the secrets manager.
    * **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit access controls and permissions related to secrets.
* **Additional Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including insecure credential storage.
