## Deep Threat Analysis: Default or Weak Credentials in Metabase

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Default or Weak Credentials" threat within the context of a Metabase application, as identified in the provided threat model. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the threat's intricacies, potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Elaboration:**

The core of this threat lies in the predictability or ease of guessing login credentials for Metabase user accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges. This can manifest in several ways:

* **Default Credentials:** Metabase, like many applications, might have default administrator accounts with well-known usernames and passwords upon initial installation. If these are not immediately changed, they become an open door for attackers. While Metabase itself doesn't ship with default credentials anymore (as of recent versions), older installations or deployments using outdated guides might still be vulnerable.
* **Weak Passwords:** Users, even when forced to create their own passwords, might choose simple, easily guessable passwords. This includes common words, patterns (like "password123"), or personal information easily obtainable through OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence).
* **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:** Even if default credentials are not an issue, the absence of strong password policies within Metabase allows users to set weak passwords, increasing the likelihood of successful brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.
* **Credential Reuse:** Users might reuse passwords across multiple platforms, including their Metabase account. If one of these other platforms is compromised, the attacker could use the stolen credentials to access the Metabase instance.

**2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through various methods:

* **Direct Brute-Force Attack:** Attackers can use automated tools to try numerous username/password combinations against the Metabase login page. With weak passwords, the chances of success are significantly higher.
* **Credential Stuffing:** If attackers have obtained lists of usernames and passwords from previous data breaches on other platforms, they can try these combinations against the Metabase login.
* **Social Engineering:** Attackers might attempt to trick users into revealing their login credentials through phishing emails or other social engineering tactics.
* **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** While the core threat is weak credentials, attackers might combine this with other vulnerabilities in Metabase or its underlying infrastructure to gain access. For instance, a vulnerability allowing bypassing authentication could be used in conjunction with guessed credentials.

**Scenario Examples:**

* **Scenario 1: The Unchanged Default:** A legacy Metabase instance was installed using an outdated guide that mentioned a default administrator account. The administrator never changed the password, allowing an attacker to log in directly.
* **Scenario 2: The Weak Password:** A user with administrative privileges chose "Password1" as their password. An attacker using a simple dictionary attack successfully gains access.
* **Scenario 3: The Credential Reuse Victim:** A user's email and password were compromised in a data breach on another website. The attacker tries these credentials on the Metabase login and gains access.

**3. Deeper Impact Analysis:**

The impact of successful exploitation of weak credentials extends beyond simply accessing Metabase:

* **Data Breach:** The attacker gains access to all data sources connected to Metabase. This could include sensitive customer data, financial information, or proprietary business intelligence.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data within the connected databases through Metabase's interface. This can lead to incorrect reporting, flawed decision-making, and even financial losses.
* **System Disruption:** The attacker can disrupt Metabase's functionality, preventing legitimate users from accessing reports and dashboards. This can impact business operations and decision-making processes.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Once inside Metabase, the attacker can create new administrator accounts, change existing user permissions, and further solidify their control.
* **Lateral Movement:** Depending on the network configuration and the permissions of the Metabase server, the attacker might be able to use the compromised instance as a stepping stone to access other systems within the network.
* **Reputational Damage:** A data breach or security incident involving Metabase can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:** Accessing and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data through a compromised Metabase instance can lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA, resulting in significant fines and penalties.

**4. Technical Deep Dive into Metabase Authentication:**

Understanding how Metabase handles authentication is crucial for implementing effective mitigations:

* **Local Authentication:** Metabase has its own built-in user management system. Users are created and authenticated directly within the application. This is the primary focus of the "Default or Weak Credentials" threat.
* **LDAP/Active Directory Integration:** Metabase can integrate with LDAP or Active Directory servers for centralized user authentication. This can improve security by leveraging existing password policies and account management processes. However, if the LDAP/AD passwords are weak, Metabase remains vulnerable.
* **SAML Single Sign-On (SSO):** Metabase supports SAML-based SSO, allowing users to authenticate through a trusted identity provider. This can significantly enhance security if the identity provider enforces strong authentication measures.
* **Password Hashing:** Metabase stores user passwords as cryptographic hashes, making it difficult (but not impossible) to recover the original passwords if the database is compromised. The strength of the hashing algorithm and the use of salting are important factors.
* **Session Management:** Once authenticated, Metabase manages user sessions using cookies or other mechanisms. Secure session management practices are important to prevent session hijacking.

**Vulnerability Analysis Specific to Metabase:**

* **Initial Setup Weakness (Historical):** Older versions of Metabase might have had less stringent password requirements during the initial setup, making it easier for administrators to set weak passwords.
* **Lack of Granular Password Policies:** While Metabase allows for some password complexity settings, the level of granularity might not be sufficient for all security requirements.
* **Potential for API Abuse:** If the Metabase API is not properly secured, attackers might try to bypass the standard login interface and exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or brute-force credentials.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries and frameworks used by Metabase could potentially be exploited to bypass authentication or gain access.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Guidance:**

Expanding on the provided mitigation strategies, here's a more detailed breakdown with implementation guidance:

* **Enforce Strong Password Policies and Mandatory Password Changes Upon Initial Setup:**
    * **Implementation:** Configure Metabase's password complexity settings to require a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * Review Metabase's documentation for the specific configuration options related to password policies.
        * Implement these settings during the initial setup and ensure they are enforced for all new users.
        * For existing installations, consider forcing password resets for all users to ensure compliance with the new policy.
        * Regularly review and update the password policy as needed.
    * **Consider:** Integrating with a password management tool for generating and storing strong passwords.

* **Disable or Remove Default Administrative Accounts:**
    * **Implementation:**  While Metabase doesn't have default credentials in recent versions, verify if any default accounts exist in older installations.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * During initial setup, carefully review the user creation process and avoid creating unnecessary administrative accounts.
        * If default accounts are found in older installations, immediately change their passwords to strong, unique values or disable/remove them entirely.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.

* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Metabase Accounts:**
    * **Implementation:** Enable MFA for all Metabase users, especially those with administrative privileges. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * Explore Metabase's built-in MFA capabilities or integration with third-party MFA providers.
        * Choose an appropriate MFA method (e.g., authenticator app, SMS codes, hardware tokens).
        * Provide clear instructions and support to users on how to set up and use MFA.
        * Consider enforcing MFA for all users or at least for those with elevated privileges.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including weak credentials.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks. After a certain number of failed login attempts, temporarily lock the account.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to slow down brute-force attempts.
* **Monitor Login Attempts:** Implement logging and monitoring of login attempts, especially failed attempts, to detect suspicious activity.
* **Educate Users on Password Security:** Train users on the importance of strong passwords, avoiding password reuse, and recognizing phishing attempts.
* **Regularly Update Metabase:** Keep Metabase updated to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities, including those related to authentication.
* **Secure Metabase Deployment:** Ensure the Metabase instance is deployed securely, following best practices for web application security. This includes securing the underlying operating system and network infrastructure.
* **Consider Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to protect the Metabase application from common web attacks, including brute-force attempts and credential stuffing.
* **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Ensure proper RBAC within Metabase to limit the impact of a compromised account. Even if an attacker gains access, their actions will be limited by the permissions assigned to that account.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

Early detection of attacks exploiting weak credentials is crucial:

* **Failed Login Attempt Monitoring:** Monitor logs for repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or for specific user accounts.
* **Account Lockout Events:** Monitor for frequent account lockout events, which could indicate a brute-force attack.
* **New User Account Creation:** Monitor for the creation of new user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, that are not initiated by authorized personnel.
* **Changes in User Permissions:** Monitor for unauthorized changes in user permissions or group memberships.
* **Unusual Activity:** Monitor for unusual activity patterns, such as logins from unfamiliar locations or at unusual times.
* **Alerting Systems:** Implement alerting systems that notify security teams of suspicious login activity.

**7. Prevention Best Practices:**

Beyond specific mitigations, adopting a proactive security mindset is essential:

* **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into the development lifecycle from the beginning.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security to protect the Metabase instance.
* **Regular Security Awareness Training:** Keep users informed about security threats and best practices.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle security breaches effectively.

**Conclusion:**

The "Default or Weak Credentials" threat, while seemingly simple, poses a critical risk to the security of the Metabase application and the sensitive data it accesses. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and a strong security culture are essential for maintaining the security posture of the Metabase environment. This proactive approach will protect the organization from potential data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
