# Threat Model Analysis for metabase/metabase

## Threat: [Plaintext Storage of Database Credentials](./threats/plaintext_storage_of_database_credentials.md)

**Description:**
*   An attacker who gains access to the Metabase server's filesystem or internal database (if Metabase uses one to store connection details) could find database credentials stored in plain text or weakly encrypted *by Metabase*.
*   The attacker could then use these credentials to directly access and compromise the connected databases.
**Impact:**
*   Full compromise of connected databases.
*   Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data.
*   Potential for further attacks leveraging the compromised database.
**Affected Component:**
*   Metabase application configuration files.
*   Internal Metabase database (if used for connection details).
*   Environment variables (if not securely managed *by Metabase's deployment*).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong encryption for database credentials at rest *within Metabase*.
*   Utilize secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) *integrated with Metabase*.
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files; use environment variables or dedicated secrets storage with appropriate access controls *enforced by the deployment environment and Metabase configuration*.
