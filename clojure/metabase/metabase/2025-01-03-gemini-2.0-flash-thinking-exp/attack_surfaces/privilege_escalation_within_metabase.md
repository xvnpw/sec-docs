## Deep Dive Analysis: Privilege Escalation within Metabase

This analysis focuses on the "Privilege Escalation within Metabase" attack surface, as described in the provided information. We will dissect the potential attack vectors, explore the underlying technical details, and provide specific recommendations for the development team to mitigate these risks.

**Understanding the Core Problem:**

Privilege escalation in Metabase allows a user with lower-level permissions to perform actions or access resources intended only for users with higher privileges. This undermines the security model and can lead to significant data breaches, system compromise, and reputational damage.

**Deconstructing the Attack Surface:**

Let's break down the attack surface based on the provided points and expand on them:

**1. Metabase's Permission System and Potential Flaws:**

* **Granularity and Complexity:** Metabase's permission system is quite granular, allowing control over access to data sources, databases, tables, individual questions, dashboards, and collections. This complexity, while offering flexibility, also introduces opportunities for misconfiguration and vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Insufficiently granular permissions in certain areas. For example, a "viewer" might have implicit read access to metadata (table schemas, column names) that could be leveraged to infer sensitive information even without direct data access.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Inconsistencies in how permissions are applied across different Metabase features (e.g., the API vs. the UI). A permission enforced in the UI might be bypassed through a direct API call.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Lack of clear separation of duties. A user with the ability to create collections might inadvertently gain broader access if the collection hierarchy isn't strictly enforced.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:**  Metabase uses RBAC, which is generally a good practice. However, flaws in its implementation can lead to privilege escalation.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Overly broad default permissions assigned to certain roles. A "viewer" role might have more capabilities than strictly necessary.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Issues with role inheritance. If a user belongs to multiple groups with overlapping but different permissions, the effective permissions might be calculated incorrectly, granting unintended access.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Lack of proper validation when assigning roles or permissions. The system might not prevent assigning conflicting or overly permissive roles.

**2. Potential Flaws in How Permissions are Assigned, Enforced, or Inherited:**

* **Assignment Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Vulnerabilities in the UI or API used to manage permissions. An attacker might exploit these to directly modify user roles or permissions.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Lack of proper input validation when assigning permissions. An attacker might inject malicious values to grant themselves elevated privileges.
* **Enforcement Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Bypassing permission checks. A vulnerability in the code responsible for enforcing permissions could allow unauthorized access. This could be due to logical errors, race conditions, or improper handling of edge cases.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Inconsistent enforcement across different layers of the application. Permissions might be correctly enforced at the UI level but not at the backend API level.
* **Inheritance Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Incorrect calculation of inherited permissions, leading to users gaining access they shouldn't have based on their group memberships or the hierarchy of collections.
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Lack of clarity or documentation on how permission inheritance works, leading to misconfigurations by administrators.

**3. Vulnerabilities in Administrative Functionalities:**

* **Unprotected Administrative Endpoints:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Administrative API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive actions like modifying settings, managing users, or accessing internal data.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint for adding a new data source might not properly verify the user's administrative privileges.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Administrative Actions:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Lack of CSRF protection on administrative actions. An attacker could trick an authenticated administrator into performing actions that escalate the attacker's privileges (e.g., adding the attacker to an admin group).
* **Insecure Default Configurations:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Default settings that are overly permissive or expose administrative functionalities without proper authentication.
* **Information Disclosure through Administrative Interfaces:**
    * **Potential Flaw:**  Administrative interfaces that reveal sensitive information about the system's configuration, users, or permissions, which could be used to plan a privilege escalation attack.

**4. Exploiting API Calls (As mentioned in the example):**

* **Direct API Manipulation:**
    * **Attack Scenario:** A "viewer" user analyzes the API calls made by the Metabase UI when an administrator performs an action (e.g., editing a dashboard). They then craft a similar API call with modified parameters to perform the same action on a resource they shouldn't have access to.
    * **Technical Detail:** This relies on the API not properly validating the user's permissions for the requested action, even if the UI prevents it.
* **Parameter Tampering:**
    * **Attack Scenario:**  A user intercepts API requests and modifies parameters related to resource IDs or permissions to gain access to unauthorized resources.
    * **Technical Detail:**  This highlights the importance of server-side validation of all input parameters.
* **Exploiting API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Attack Scenario:**  Discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in the Metabase API itself, such as injection flaws (SQL injection, command injection) or authentication bypasses, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or direct database access with elevated privileges.

**Technical Details of Potential Exploits:**

* **Inconsistent Permission Checks:** Imagine a scenario where viewing a dashboard is correctly restricted, but the underlying API endpoint for fetching the dashboard's data isn't as strictly controlled. A malicious user could potentially access the data directly through the API.
* **Race Conditions in Permission Updates:** If multiple users or processes are simultaneously updating permissions, a race condition could occur, leading to temporary windows where permissions are incorrectly assigned or enforced.
* **Logic Errors in Permission Evaluation:**  Complex permission logic can be prone to errors. For example, a conditional statement checking permissions might have a flaw that allows certain users to bypass the check under specific circumstances.
* **Exploiting Weak Authentication Mechanisms:** While not directly privilege escalation, if the authentication mechanism is weak (e.g., susceptible to brute-force attacks or using default credentials), an attacker could gain access as a legitimate user with higher privileges.

**Impact Analysis (Expanding on the provided points):**

* **Unauthorized Modification or Deletion of Data, Dashboards, or Settings:** This can lead to data corruption, business disruption, and loss of critical insights.
* **Access to Sensitive Information Beyond the User's Intended Scope:** This can result in data breaches, violation of privacy regulations, and reputational damage.
* **Lateral Movement within the System:**  Gaining elevated privileges within Metabase could potentially allow an attacker to access connected data sources with the permissions of the Metabase user or service account.
* **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, exploiting vulnerabilities in administrative functionalities could grant an attacker full control over the Metabase instance and potentially the underlying server.
