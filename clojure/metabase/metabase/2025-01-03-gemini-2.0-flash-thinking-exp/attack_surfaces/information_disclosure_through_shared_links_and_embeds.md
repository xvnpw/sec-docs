## Deep Analysis of Information Disclosure through Shared Links and Embeds in Metabase

This analysis delves into the attack surface of "Information Disclosure through Shared Links and Embeds" in Metabase, providing a comprehensive view for the development team to understand the risks and implement effective mitigations.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Attack Surface:**

The core vulnerability lies in the tension between Metabase's powerful sharing and embedding capabilities and the inherent risks of exposing sensitive data publicly or within less secure environments. While these features are crucial for collaboration and data dissemination, they introduce potential pathways for unauthorized access.

**1.1. Metabase's Contribution - A Granular Breakdown:**

* **Public Shared Links:**
    * **Link Generation Mechanism:** How are these links generated? Are they sequential, random, or based on predictable patterns?  Weak link generation increases the risk of brute-forcing or guessing.
    * **Link Expiration:**  Does Metabase offer options for link expiration?  Persistent links significantly increase the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.
    * **Permissions Associated with Links:** What level of access does a public link grant? Is it read-only? Does it allow filtering or downloading data?  Overly permissive access exacerbates the risk.
    * **Link Revocation:** How easy is it to revoke a public link?  Delayed or difficult revocation leaves data exposed for longer periods.
    * **Metadata Exposure:** Does the shared link inadvertently expose metadata about the dashboard, questions, or underlying data sources?

* **Embedded Visualizations:**
    * **Embedding Methods:** Metabase offers various embedding options (e.g., iframes, signed embeds). The security implications differ significantly between these methods.
    * **Iframe Embedding:** While simple, iframes rely on the security of the embedding application. If the embedding application is compromised, the embedded Metabase visualization is also at risk. Lack of proper `sandbox` attributes can further increase risks.
    * **Signed Embedding:** This method uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate access. However, vulnerabilities can arise from:
        * **Secret Key Management:**  If the secret key used to sign the JWTs is compromised, attackers can generate their own valid tokens.
        * **JWT Validation:**  Improper validation on the Metabase side can lead to bypassing authentication.
        * **Token Expiration:**  Lack of or overly long token expiration increases the risk of stolen tokens being used.
        * **Payload Security:**  Are the claims within the JWT properly secured and validated?  Can attackers manipulate the payload to gain unauthorized access?
    * **API Endpoints for Embedding:**  Are the API endpoints used for generating embed codes and handling embedded requests properly secured against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

**1.2. Scenario Deep Dive - Expanding on the Examples:**

* **Accidental Sharing of Sensitive Financial Data:**
    * **User Error:**  Lack of awareness or training can lead users to unintentionally share sensitive dashboards publicly.
    * **Default Settings:** Are public sharing options enabled by default, potentially leading to accidental exposure?
    * **Lack of Clear Warnings:** Does Metabase provide clear warnings and guidance when users attempt to share dashboards publicly, highlighting the potential risks?
    * **Granular Access Controls:**  Does Metabase offer fine-grained access controls that could prevent users from even having the option to share sensitive data publicly in the first place?

* **Insecurely Embedded Dashboard:**
    * **Compromised Embedding Application:** If the external application hosting the embedded dashboard is compromised (e.g., through an XSS vulnerability), attackers can gain access to the embedded Metabase content.
    * **Lack of Authentication in Embedding Application:** If the embedding application doesn't have its own robust authentication mechanism, anyone can potentially access the embedded Metabase visualization.
    * **Missing Security Headers:**  The embedding application might be missing crucial security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`) that could prevent malicious framing or script injection.
    * **Data Leakage Through Embedding Application:** The embedding application itself might inadvertently log or expose data retrieved from the embedded Metabase visualization.

**2. Technical Analysis of Potential Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations:**

* **Predictable Link Generation:**  If the algorithm for generating public share links is predictable, attackers could potentially brute-force or guess valid links.
* **Lack of Link Expiration or Easy Revocation:**  Once a public link is shared, it might remain active indefinitely, even if the data becomes outdated or sensitive. Difficult or delayed revocation increases the risk window.
* **Overly Permissive Access via Public Links:**  If public links grant too much access (e.g., ability to download underlying data), the impact of a breach is significantly higher.
* **Insecure Storage of Embedding Secrets:**  If the secret keys used for signed embedding are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text in code or configuration files), they can be easily compromised.
* **Vulnerabilities in JWT Implementation:**  Weak or outdated JWT libraries, improper signature verification, or lack of audience/issuer validation can lead to authentication bypass.
* **CSRF Vulnerabilities in Embedding API Endpoints:**  Attackers could potentially trick authenticated users into generating embed codes or modifying embedding settings without their knowledge.
* **XSS Vulnerabilities in Embedded Visualizations:**  If user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in embedded visualizations, it could lead to XSS attacks within the embedding application's context.
* **Information Leakage through Browser Caching:**  Sensitive data displayed in shared dashboards or embedded visualizations might be cached by browsers, potentially allowing unauthorized access by other users of the same machine.
* **Logging Sensitive Data in Embed Requests:**  Metabase or the embedding application might inadvertently log sensitive data passed in embed requests, creating a potential audit trail for attackers.

**3. Detailed Risk Assessment - Expanding on the Impact:**

* **Financial Loss:** Exposure of financial data can lead to direct financial loss through fraud, theft, or regulatory fines.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches erode trust with customers, partners, and the public, leading to long-term reputational damage.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can result in legal penalties and fines under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and others.
* **Competitive Disadvantage:**  Exposure of strategic business information can provide competitors with an unfair advantage.
* **Loss of Intellectual Property:**  Dashboards containing proprietary insights or algorithms could be exposed, leading to the loss of valuable intellectual property.
* **Privacy Violations:**  Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) constitutes a privacy violation, with significant ethical and legal implications.
* **Security Incidents in Embedding Applications:**  A vulnerability in Metabase's embedding features could be exploited to compromise the security of the applications where the visualizations are embedded.

**4. Enhanced Mitigation Strategies - Actionable Steps for the Development Team:**

* **Strengthen Public Link Security:**
    * **Implement Strong, Non-Sequential Link Generation:** Utilize cryptographically secure random number generators for link creation.
    * **Mandatory Link Expiration:**  Enforce expiration dates for public links and provide users with options to set custom expiration times.
    * **Granular Permissions for Public Links:** Allow administrators to define specific permissions associated with public links (e.g., read-only, no download).
    * **Easy Link Revocation:** Provide a clear and intuitive mechanism for users and administrators to revoke public links immediately.
    * **Watermarking/Attribution:** Consider adding watermarks or attribution to publicly shared content to track its origin.

* **Enhance Embedding Security:**
    * **Prioritize Signed Embedding:** Encourage the use of signed embedding with JWTs for enhanced security.
    * **Secure Secret Key Management:** Implement robust key management practices, such as using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and rotating keys regularly.
    * **Strict JWT Validation:** Implement thorough JWT validation on the Metabase side, including signature verification, expiration checks, and audience/issuer validation.
    * **Short-Lived JWTs:**  Use short expiration times for JWTs to minimize the impact of compromised tokens.
    * **Payload Encryption (if necessary):**  Consider encrypting sensitive data within the JWT payload for an extra layer of security.
    * **Implement Robust CSRF Protection:**  Ensure all API endpoints related to embedding are protected against CSRF attacks using techniques like anti-CSRF tokens.
    * **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly sanitize user-supplied data and encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in embedded visualizations.
    * **`sandbox` Attribute for Iframes:**  When using iframe embedding, utilize the `sandbox` attribute with appropriate restrictions to limit the capabilities of the embedded content.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP in both Metabase and the embedding application to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.

* **General Security Best Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and share data.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in sharing and embedding features.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the risks associated with public sharing and embedding and best practices for secure data handling.
    * **Centralized Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of sharing and embedding activities to detect suspicious behavior.
    * **Consider Disabling Public Sharing:** If public sharing is not a critical requirement, consider disabling the feature entirely to eliminate the associated risks.
    * **Secure Defaults:** Ensure that default settings for sharing and embedding are secure and minimize the risk of accidental exposure.
    * **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Metabase and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
