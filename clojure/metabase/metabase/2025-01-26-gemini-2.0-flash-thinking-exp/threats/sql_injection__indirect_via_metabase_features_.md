### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: SQL Injection (Indirect via Metabase Features)

#### 4.1 Threat Description Expansion

The "SQL Injection (Indirect via Metabase Features)" threat highlights a critical security concern in Metabase. Unlike direct SQL injection where an attacker directly crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into an application's input fields intended for database interaction, this threat focuses on **indirect injection**.  This means attackers leverage legitimate Metabase features, designed for user interaction and data exploration, to indirectly construct and execute malicious SQL queries against the underlying database.

The core issue is that while Metabase aims to abstract away direct SQL interaction for many users, certain features, especially those offering flexibility and customization, can become conduits for SQL injection if not implemented and secured properly.  The trust placed in Metabase to generate safe SQL queries based on user input can be undermined if vulnerabilities exist in its query generation logic, parameter handling, or custom SQL execution pathways.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

Several Metabase features can be potential attack vectors for indirect SQL injection:

* **4.2.1 Query Builder:**
    * **Manipulated Filters and Conditions:**  Attackers might attempt to manipulate the filters, conditions, and aggregations within the Query Builder interface. If Metabase doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs when translating them into SQL, an attacker could inject malicious SQL fragments within these clauses. For example, injecting malicious code into a text filter field that is not correctly escaped could lead to SQL injection.
    * **Exploiting Complex Queries:**  Building complex queries with multiple joins, aggregations, and custom expressions might expose vulnerabilities in Metabase's query parsing and generation logic.  Attackers could try to craft intricate queries that trigger unexpected behavior or bypass security checks, leading to SQL injection.

* **4.2.2 Custom SQL Feature:**
    * **Direct SQL Injection via Custom Queries:**  The Custom SQL feature is inherently more risky as it allows users to write SQL queries directly. While intended for advanced users, if access control is not properly implemented or if Metabase doesn't adequately sanitize or validate parameters used within custom SQL, it becomes a prime target for SQL injection.  Attackers with access to this feature could directly inject malicious SQL code.
    * **Parameter Manipulation in Custom SQL:**  Even with parameterized queries in Custom SQL, vulnerabilities can arise if parameter handling within Metabase is flawed. Attackers might try to bypass parameterization by injecting SQL code within parameter values or by manipulating how parameters are passed to the database driver.

* **4.2.3 Parameter Handling:**
    * **Parameter Injection:**  Metabase uses parameters to make dashboards and questions dynamic. If parameter values are not properly sanitized and escaped before being incorporated into SQL queries, attackers could inject malicious SQL code through parameter values. This is especially critical when parameters are used in Custom SQL or when Metabase dynamically generates queries based on parameter selections.
    * **Parameter Type Mismatches:**  Exploiting type mismatches between expected parameter types and actual input could potentially lead to SQL injection. For example, if a parameter is expected to be an integer but is treated as a string without proper sanitization, an attacker might inject SQL code within a string value.

* **4.2.4 Database Driver Interactions:**
    * **Driver-Specific Vulnerabilities (Less Likely but Possible):** While less directly related to Metabase features, vulnerabilities in the database drivers used by Metabase could be exploited indirectly. If Metabase relies on driver functionalities that have security flaws, attackers might be able to leverage these flaws through Metabase's interaction with the driver. This is less common but should be considered in a comprehensive security assessment.

#### 4.3 Potential Vulnerabilities

The following potential vulnerabilities within Metabase could enable these attack vectors:

* **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Lack of robust input validation and sanitization on user-provided data within Metabase features is a primary vulnerability. If Metabase doesn't properly validate and sanitize inputs from the Query Builder, Custom SQL editor, or parameter inputs, it becomes susceptible to SQL injection.
* **Improper Query Generation Logic:**  Flaws in Metabase's query generation logic, especially when translating user-friendly interfaces into SQL, can introduce vulnerabilities. If the query generation process doesn't correctly handle special characters, escape user inputs, or use parameterized queries internally, it can lead to SQL injection.
* **Lack of Parameterized Queries Internally:**  If Metabase itself doesn't consistently use parameterized queries when interacting with the database, even for its internal operations based on user inputs, it can be vulnerable.  This is crucial for all database interactions, not just those directly exposed to users.
* **Inadequate Access Control for Custom SQL:**  If access to the Custom SQL feature is not properly restricted to trusted users, it significantly increases the risk of SQL injection.  Overly permissive access control can allow malicious users or compromised accounts to directly inject SQL.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries or Components:**  Metabase relies on various third-party libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, especially those related to database interaction or query parsing, could indirectly introduce SQL injection risks into Metabase.

#### 4.4 Exploitation Scenarios (Examples)

* **Scenario 1: Query Builder Filter Manipulation:**
    1. An attacker gains access to a Metabase account with permissions to use the Query Builder.
    2. The attacker creates a question using the Query Builder and adds a filter to a text field.
    3. In the filter value field, instead of a legitimate filter value, the attacker injects malicious SQL code, for example: `' OR 1=1 -- ` (This classic SQL injection payload attempts to bypass the intended filter and potentially return all data).
    4. If Metabase doesn't properly sanitize this input, it might construct an SQL query that includes the injected code.
    5. When Metabase executes this query against the database, the injected SQL code is executed, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or other malicious actions.

* **Scenario 2: Custom SQL Parameter Injection:**
    1. An attacker gains access to a Metabase account with permissions to use the Custom SQL feature.
    2. The attacker creates a Custom SQL question that uses a parameter, for example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = {{username}}`.
    3. The attacker shares the question or finds a way to manipulate the parameter value.
    4. Instead of providing a legitimate username, the attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `username` parameter value, for example: `' OR 1=1 -- ` or `; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    5. If Metabase doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize the parameter value in the Custom SQL query, the injected code is executed.
    6. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation (like dropping the `users` table in the example), or even database server compromise depending on database permissions and the injected code.

#### 4.5 Impact

Successful exploitation of "SQL Injection (Indirect via Metabase Features)" can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including customer information, financial records, intellectual property, and more. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, and incorrect reporting. This can have serious consequences for decision-making and operational processes.
* **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to bypass authentication and authorization controls, gaining access to restricted data or functionalities within Metabase and potentially the underlying database. In some cases, they might even escalate their privileges to database administrator level.
* **Database Server Compromise:** In extreme scenarios, depending on database configurations and vulnerabilities, successful SQL injection could potentially lead to database server compromise, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, gain persistent access, or launch further attacks on the infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could craft SQL injection payloads that consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for the Metabase application and potentially other applications sharing the same database server.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies Evaluation and Enhancement

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but can be further elaborated and enhanced:

* **Keep Metabase Updated:**  **Strongly Recommended and Essential.** Regularly updating Metabase to the latest version is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities, including potential SQL injection flaws.  Establish a process for timely updates and monitor Metabase security advisories.

* **Carefully Review and Sanitize User Inputs in Custom SQL and Parameterized Queries:** **Critical and Requires Rigorous Implementation.** This is paramount.
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data used in query construction. Define allowed character sets, data types, and formats. Reject invalid inputs.
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  When incorporating user inputs into SQL queries (even indirectly), ensure proper output encoding or escaping is applied based on the specific database system being used. This prevents special characters from being interpreted as SQL code.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions within Metabase and the underlying database. Restrict access to the Custom SQL feature to only trusted and trained users.

* **Use Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements:** **Highly Effective and Should be Standard Practice.**
    * **Enforce Parameterized Queries:**  Metabase should internally utilize parameterized queries and prepared statements for all database interactions, especially when constructing queries based on user inputs from the Query Builder, parameters, or Custom SQL.
    * **Educate Users on Parameterized Queries in Custom SQL:**  If Custom SQL is used, strongly encourage and provide guidance to users on how to properly use parameterized queries within their custom SQL code.

* **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization on All User-Provided Data:** **Comprehensive and Proactive Approach.**
    * **Beyond Query Builder and Custom SQL:**  Extend input validation and sanitization to all user inputs within Metabase, including dashboard names, question titles, descriptions, and any other fields where user-provided data might be processed and potentially used in query generation.
    * **Server-Side Validation:**  Perform input validation and sanitization on the server-side, not just client-side, to prevent bypassing client-side checks.

* **Regularly Security Test Metabase Deployments, Especially Custom SQL Features:** **Essential for Ongoing Security.**
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing specifically targeting Metabase features, including the Query Builder, Custom SQL, and parameter handling, to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:**  If possible, perform static and dynamic code analysis on Metabase (or its open-source components if available) to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities that could lead to SQL injection.
    * **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of Metabase configurations, access controls, and security practices to ensure they are aligned with best practices and security policies.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF in front of the Metabase application to detect and block common SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specific to Metabase and its expected traffic patterns.
* **Database Security Hardening:**  Harden the underlying database server by following security best practices, such as:
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Metabase Database User:**  Grant the Metabase application database user only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Avoid granting excessive permissions like `CREATE`, `DROP`, or `ALTER` unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.
    * **Database Auditing and Logging:**  Enable database auditing and logging to monitor database activity and detect suspicious queries or access attempts.
    * **Regular Database Security Updates:**  Keep the database server software updated with the latest security patches.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to help mitigate certain types of injection attacks and reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide security awareness training to Metabase users, especially those with access to Custom SQL, to educate them about SQL injection risks and secure coding practices.
