## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Metabase

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack surface within Metabase. This involves:

*   **Identifying potential features and functionalities within Metabase that could be susceptible to SSRF vulnerabilities.**
*   **Analyzing the potential attack vectors and exploitation techniques an attacker could employ.**
*   **Evaluating the potential impact of successful SSRF attacks on Metabase and the underlying infrastructure.**
*   **Providing actionable and specific mitigation strategies to minimize or eliminate the identified SSRF risks.**
*   **Raising awareness among the development team about secure coding practices related to handling external requests and user-provided URLs.**

Ultimately, this analysis aims to strengthen Metabase's security posture by proactively addressing SSRF vulnerabilities and ensuring the application is resilient against this type of attack.

### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following aspects of Metabase relevant to SSRF:

*   **Features involving URL handling:** This includes any functionality where Metabase processes or interacts with URLs, whether user-provided or internally generated. Key areas to examine are:
    *   **Data Source Connections:**  How Metabase connects to databases and other data sources, particularly if URLs are used for connection strings or API endpoints.
    *   **Webhooks and Notifications:**  Features that allow sending notifications or triggering actions via webhooks, which often involve specifying target URLs.
    *   **Custom Dashboards and Visualizations:**  If there are capabilities to embed external content or fetch data from external URLs within dashboards or visualizations.
    *   **Image Loading and Embedding:**  Functionality that allows users to upload or link images, especially if URLs are used for image sources.
    *   **API Interactions:**  Metabase's internal and external APIs, focusing on endpoints that accept URLs as parameters or process URL-like data.
    *   **Import/Export Features:**  If Metabase allows importing data from or exporting data to external URLs.
    *   **Plugins and Extensions:**  If Metabase supports plugins or extensions, these could introduce new SSRF attack surfaces if they handle external requests.

*   **Request Handling Mechanisms:**  We will analyze how Metabase handles outbound HTTP requests, including:
    *   **URL parsing and validation:**  How effectively Metabase validates and sanitizes URLs before making requests.
    *   **Request construction:**  How requests are built and if there are opportunities for manipulation.
    *   **Response handling:**  How Metabase processes responses from external servers and if sensitive information could be leaked through error messages or response data.

*   **Metabase Configuration and Deployment:**  We will consider how different Metabase configurations and deployment environments might influence the SSRF risk, such as network segmentation and access controls.

**Out of Scope:**

*   This analysis will primarily focus on the application-level SSRF vulnerabilities within Metabase itself. Infrastructure-level SSRF risks (e.g., misconfigured cloud instances) are outside the immediate scope, although network segmentation as a mitigation strategy will be considered.
*   Detailed analysis of third-party libraries used by Metabase is not in scope unless directly relevant to identified Metabase features and SSRF vulnerabilities.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ a combination of techniques:

*   **Feature Inventory and Documentation Review:**
    *   Systematically review Metabase's official documentation, user guides, and API documentation to identify all features that involve URL handling or external requests.
    *   Create an inventory of these features, noting their purpose and how they interact with URLs.

*   **Static Code Analysis (if feasible and access is granted/available):**
    *   If access to the Metabase codebase is available (being open-source), perform static code analysis on the identified features.
    *   Focus on code sections responsible for URL parsing, validation, request construction, and response handling.
    *   Look for patterns indicative of potential SSRF vulnerabilities, such as insufficient input validation, lack of URL sanitization, or insecure request construction.

*   **Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Set up a controlled Metabase environment for testing.
    *   For each identified feature, attempt to exploit potential SSRF vulnerabilities by crafting malicious URLs and observing Metabase's behavior.
    *   Utilize common SSRF attack techniques, including:
        *   **Port scanning:** Attempting to access internal ports on the Metabase server or internal network.
        *   **Accessing internal services:** Trying to reach internal services like databases, APIs, or admin panels.
        *   **File retrieval:** Attempting to read local files on the Metabase server.
        *   **Bypassing allow-lists/block-lists:** Testing the effectiveness of any implemented URL filtering mechanisms.
        *   **Exploiting different URL schemes:**  Trying various URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`, `dict://`) if supported by the underlying libraries.
        *   **Blind SSRF detection:**  If direct response is not visible, use techniques to infer SSRF exploitation, such as timing attacks or monitoring network traffic.
    *   Use tools like `curl`, `Burp Suite`, and custom scripts to facilitate testing and exploitation.

*   **Vulnerability Research and CVE Database Review:**
    *   Search public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) and security advisories for any previously reported SSRF vulnerabilities in Metabase or similar applications.
    *   Review security-related discussions and forums related to Metabase to identify any community-reported SSRF concerns.

*   **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Recommendations:**
    *   Evaluate the effectiveness of the generic mitigation strategies provided in the initial attack surface description.
    *   Based on the findings of the analysis, develop specific and actionable mitigation recommendations tailored to Metabase's architecture and identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Prioritize mitigation strategies based on risk severity and feasibility of implementation.

### 4. Deep Analysis of SSRF Attack Surface in Metabase

Based on the initial understanding of Metabase and common web application functionalities, we can hypothesize potential SSRF attack vectors within Metabase. Let's analyze these areas in detail:

**4.1 Data Source Connections:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:** When configuring data source connections (e.g., connecting to a database, API, or other services), Metabase might accept URLs as part of the connection string or configuration parameters. If these URLs are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL pointing to an internal resource.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with sufficient privileges to configure data sources (e.g., an administrator or a user with data access permissions) could modify an existing data source connection or create a new one. They could replace the legitimate data source URL with a malicious URL targeting:
    *   `http://localhost:<internal_service_port>` to access internal services running on the Metabase server.
    *   `http://<internal_ip>:<internal_service_port>` to access services on the internal network.
    *   `file:///etc/passwd` (if `file://` scheme is supported and not blocked) to attempt to read local files.
    *   `http://attacker-controlled-server` to exfiltrate internal data or perform blind SSRF attacks.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Internal Port Scanning:** Discovering open ports and services on the Metabase server or internal network.
    *   **Access to Internal Services:** Interacting with internal databases, APIs, administration panels, or other services, potentially bypassing authentication if these services rely on internal network access for security.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive data from internal services or local files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading internal services with requests or causing resource exhaustion.

**4.2 Webhooks and Notifications:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:** Metabase might offer features to send notifications or trigger actions via webhooks. This typically involves configuring a webhook URL where Metabase will send HTTP requests upon certain events. If the webhook URL is user-configurable and not properly validated, it could be exploited for SSRF.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with permissions to configure webhooks (e.g., for alerts or automated actions) could specify a malicious webhook URL. When Metabase triggers the webhook, it will make an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL or an internal resource specified by the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Similar to data source connections, successful SSRF via webhooks could lead to:
    *   Internal port scanning and service discovery.
    *   Access to internal services.
    *   Information disclosure (if the webhook response is processed and displayed or logged).
    *   Potential for command execution if vulnerable internal services are targeted (less likely but theoretically possible).

**4.3 Custom Dashboards and Visualizations (Hypothetical):**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:** If Metabase allows embedding external content (e.g., iframes, images from URLs) or fetching data from external URLs within dashboards or visualizations, this could be an SSRF vector.  *This needs to be verified if such features exist in Metabase.*
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could craft a dashboard or visualization that includes a malicious URL. When another user views this dashboard, Metabase might make a request to the attacker-specified URL on behalf of the viewer's session.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the implementation, the impact could range from:
    *   **Information disclosure:** If the external content is displayed, it could reveal information from internal resources.
    *   **Client-side SSRF (if the request is made from the user's browser):** Less severe SSRF, but still potentially exploitable for information gathering or cross-site scripting (XSS) in some scenarios.
    *   **Server-side SSRF (if Metabase server makes the request):**  More severe, similar impact to previous vectors.

**4.4 Image Loading and Embedding (Hypothetical):**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:** If Metabase allows users to upload images or link images using URLs (e.g., for profile pictures, dashboard elements), and if Metabase fetches these images from URLs, SSRF vulnerabilities could arise. *Again, feature verification is needed.*
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could provide a malicious URL as the image source. When Metabase attempts to load the image, it will make a request to the attacker-controlled URL or internal resource.
*   **Impact:** Primarily information disclosure (if error messages reveal internal network details) or potentially internal port scanning. Less likely to be as severe as other vectors unless image processing libraries themselves have vulnerabilities exploitable via SSRF.

**4.5 API Interactions:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:** Metabase's API endpoints might accept URLs as parameters for various operations. If these URLs are not properly validated, API endpoints could become SSRF attack vectors.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could craft malicious API requests with manipulated URLs in parameters.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the specific API endpoint and its functionality. Could lead to similar impacts as other vectors, including internal access, information disclosure, or DoS.

**4.6 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Metabase-Specific):**

Based on the identified potential vulnerabilities, we can refine the generic mitigation strategies and provide more specific recommendations for Metabase:

*   **Robust URL Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all user-provided URLs. Validate URL format, scheme (e.g., allow only `http://` and `https://` if appropriate), and potentially hostname.
    *   **URL Parsing Libraries:** Utilize secure and well-maintained URL parsing libraries to parse and normalize URLs, making it harder for attackers to bypass validation with URL encoding or obfuscation techniques.
    *   **Canonicalization:** Canonicalize URLs to a consistent format before validation to prevent bypasses using different URL representations.

*   **Implement Allow-lists for Destination Hosts and Protocols:**
    *   **Restrict Allowed Hosts:**  For features where external requests are necessary, implement allow-lists of explicitly permitted destination hosts or domains.  This is crucial for data source connections and webhooks.  For example, for data source connections, only allow connections to known database server domains or IP ranges. For webhooks, consider allowing only specific external services or domains if possible.
    *   **Protocol Restrictions:**  Strictly limit allowed protocols to `http://` and `https://` and disable or block other potentially dangerous protocols like `file://`, `gopher://`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, etc.

*   **Network Segmentation and Access Controls:**
    *   **Internal Network Segmentation:**  Segment the internal network to limit the impact of SSRF attacks. Place sensitive internal services behind firewalls and restrict access from the Metabase server.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Run Metabase with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running Metabase as root or with excessive permissions that could be abused if SSRF is exploited.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement egress firewall rules on the Metabase server to restrict outbound connections to only necessary external services and ports. Deny outbound connections to internal networks unless explicitly required and justified.

*   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**
    *   If certain features that involve external requests (e.g., specific webhook integrations, external content embedding) are not essential, consider disabling them to reduce the attack surface.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on SSRF vulnerabilities, to proactively identify and address any weaknesses in Metabase's security posture.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of client-side SSRF and limit the impact of XSS vulnerabilities that could be chained with SSRF.

*   **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling for features that make external requests to mitigate potential DoS attacks via SSRF.

**4.7 Further Steps:**

*   **Feature Verification:**  The next step is to verify the existence and implementation details of the hypothetical features mentioned (custom dashboards/visualizations, image loading) within Metabase.
*   **Code Review and Dynamic Testing:** Conduct code review and dynamic testing as outlined in the methodology to confirm the presence of SSRF vulnerabilities in the identified features and to validate the effectiveness of potential mitigation strategies.
*   **Prioritization and Remediation:** Based on the findings, prioritize the identified SSRF vulnerabilities based on risk severity and implement the recommended mitigation strategies.

By following this deep analysis and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the SSRF attack surface in Metabase and enhance the overall security of the application.
