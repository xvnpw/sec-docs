# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for metabase/metabase

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) within Metabase](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__within_metabase.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA in Metabase Authentication Settings:** Configure MFA within the Metabase Admin panel under "Authentication". Choose a supported MFA method (e.g., Google Authenticator, TOTP).
    2.  **User Enrollment:** Guide all Metabase users, especially administrators and those with access to sensitive data, to enroll in MFA through their Metabase profile settings.
    3.  **Enforce MFA Policy:** Make MFA mandatory for all users or specific user groups within Metabase's authentication settings.
    4.  **Regularly Review MFA Usage:** Monitor MFA enrollment and usage within Metabase user management.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to Metabase user accounts even if passwords are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover:**  High risk reduction. MFA adds a crucial extra layer of security directly within Metabase.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented for administrator accounts using Google Authenticator within Metabase.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is not yet enforced for standard user accounts within Metabase.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Granular Permissions within Metabase](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__granular_permissions_within_metabase.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles Based on Job Functions in Metabase:** Identify distinct user roles relevant to Metabase access (e.g., Data Analyst, Dashboard Creator, Viewer).
    2.  **Map Roles to Metabase Groups:** Create corresponding groups in Metabase's Admin panel under "Permissions".
    3.  **Assign Permissions to Groups in Metabase:**  Carefully configure permissions for each Metabase group directly within Metabase. Grant the *minimum* necessary permissions to access specific databases, collections, dashboards, and actions (e.g., view, query, edit, create) *within Metabase's permission settings*.
    4.  **Implement Data Sandboxes in Metabase (If Needed):** For sensitive data, create data sandboxes within Metabase's data model settings to further restrict data access for specific groups or users *within Metabase*.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Roles and Permissions in Metabase:** Periodically audit user roles and permissions *within Metabase* to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing data they are not authorized to view or query *through Metabase*, reducing the risk of data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Users (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of users to accidentally or maliciously modify or delete data they should not have access to *through Metabase*.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  Restricts the potential damage if a Metabase account is compromised, as the attacker's access is limited to the permissions assigned to that user's role *within Metabase*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High risk reduction. Granular permissions *in Metabase* are crucial for data confidentiality within the application.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Medium risk reduction. Depends on the level of restriction on write/edit permissions *configured in Metabase*.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium risk reduction. Limits the scope of damage *within Metabase's context*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic groups (Admin, Analyst, Viewer) are used in Metabase, but permissions are not finely tuned *within Metabase's settings*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular roles need to be defined within Metabase based on specific team functions.
    *   Data sandbox implementation is missing for highly sensitive datasets *within Metabase*.
    *   Regular review process for roles and permissions *within Metabase* is not yet established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Management of Public Sharing and Embedding in Metabase](./mitigation_strategies/careful_management_of_public_sharing_and_embedding_in_metabase.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Public Sharing by Default in Metabase Settings:**  Configure Metabase settings to disable public sharing of dashboards and questions as the default.
    2.  **Require Justification for Public Sharing:** Implement a process that requires users to justify and obtain approval before enabling public sharing for any dashboard or question in Metabase.
    3.  **Implement Access Controls for Embedded Dashboards in Metabase:** When embedding Metabase dashboards, utilize Metabase's embedding features that allow for signed embedding or other access control mechanisms to restrict access to embedded content.
    4.  **Regularly Review Publicly Shared Content in Metabase:**  Periodically audit publicly shared dashboards and questions within Metabase to ensure they are still necessary and do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. Revoke public links when no longer needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents accidental public exposure of sensitive data through publicly shared dashboards or questions in Metabase.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data via Embedding (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to data through improperly secured embedded Metabase dashboards.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure:** High risk reduction. Controls public sharing features directly within Metabase.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data via Embedding:** Medium risk reduction. Depends on the chosen embedding access control methods in Metabase.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Public sharing is generally discouraged but not strictly controlled within Metabase.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Default disabling of public sharing in Metabase settings is missing.

    3.  **Utilize Metabase's Query Builder Features for Parameterization:** Leverage Metabase's GUI query builder, which provides built-in features for parameterization through filters and variables, guiding users towards secure query practices within the application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Parameterized queries within Metabase are a primary defense against SQL injection vulnerabilities *exploited through Metabase*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Parameterization *within Metabase* is highly effective in mitigating SQL injection risks originating from user interactions with Metabase.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Metabase's query builder encourages parameterization for many operations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Users are not consistently educated on the importance of parameterized queries specifically within Metabase when using custom SQL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit SQL Query Capabilities in Metabase](./mitigation_strategies/limit_sql_query_capabilities_in_metabase.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict SQL Query Access in Metabase Permissions:**  Utilize Metabase's permission settings to restrict the ability for certain user groups (e.g., Viewers, less technical users) to write raw SQL queries. Grant SQL query access only to roles that require it (e.g., Analysts, Data Scientists).
    2.  **Encourage GUI Query Builder Usage in Metabase:** Promote the use of Metabase's GUI query builder for less technical users, as it provides more safeguards and encourages parameterized queries compared to raw SQL.
    3.  **Disable or Restrict Dangerous SQL Commands (Indirectly via Database Permissions):** While not directly a Metabase setting, ensure that the database user Metabase uses has restricted permissions at the database level to limit the impact of potentially dangerous SQL commands even if executed through Metabase (e.g., restrict `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP` permissions at the database level for the Metabase user).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Medium to High Severity):** Limiting SQL query capabilities reduces the attack surface for SQL injection vulnerabilities *exploited through Metabase*, especially by less experienced users.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion via SQL (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users accidentally or intentionally executing harmful SQL commands *through Metabase* if they have limited SQL access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of SQL injection by limiting SQL access within Metabase.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Medium risk reduction. Provides a safeguard against unintended database changes initiated *through Metabase*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic permission levels exist in Metabase, but SQL query access is not strictly limited based on user roles.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular control over SQL query access based on user roles within Metabase permissions is needed.
    *   Clear guidance and training on using the GUI query builder for less technical users is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration in Web Server for Metabase](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__configuration_in_web_server_for_metabase.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict CSP for Metabase:**  Develop a Content Security Policy (CSP) header specifically tailored for the Metabase application. Start with a restrictive policy that only allows necessary resources and gradually refine it.
    2.  **Configure Web Server to Send CSP Header for Metabase:** Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) that serves Metabase to send the defined CSP header with all HTTP responses for the Metabase application. This is configured *outside* of Metabase itself, but directly impacts Metabase's security.
    3.  **Test and Refine CSP for Metabase:** Thoroughly test the CSP in the context of Metabase to ensure it doesn't break Metabase functionality. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve any CSP violations specific to Metabase.
    4.  **Monitor CSP Reports (Optional):**  Consider configuring CSP reporting to receive reports of CSP violations specifically for the Metabase application, which can help identify potential XSS attempts or misconfigurations targeting Metabase.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** CSP helps mitigate XSS vulnerabilities *within the Metabase application* by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium to High risk reduction. CSP is a powerful defense against many types of XSS attacks *targeting Metabase*, but it needs to be carefully configured and maintained for Metabase specifically.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No CSP header is currently configured for the Metabase instance in the web server.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP header needs to be defined and implemented in the web server configuration *specifically for Metabase*.
    *   Testing and refinement of the CSP policy *for Metabase* are required.
