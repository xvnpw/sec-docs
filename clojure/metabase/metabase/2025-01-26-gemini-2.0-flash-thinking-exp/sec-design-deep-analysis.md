### 2. Security Implications of Key Components and Mitigation Strategies

Based on the security design review, we will now analyze the security implications of each key component and provide tailored mitigation strategies.

**2.1. Authentication and Authorization:**

**Security Implications:**

*   **Username/Password (Local DB):**
    *   **Threat:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, dictionary attacks. If weak passwords are used or no rate limiting is in place, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Threat:**  Compromised credentials leading to full account takeover and access to sensitive data and Metabase functionalities.
*   **LDAP/Active Directory, Google OAuth/SAML SSO:**
    *   **Threat:** Reliance on external systems means security is dependent on the configuration and security of these external providers. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these systems can lead to unauthorized access to Metabase.
    *   **Threat:** Account takeover if the external SSO provider is compromised or if there are vulnerabilities in the integration with Metabase.
*   **API Tokens:**
    *   **Threat:** Insecure generation, storage, or rotation of API tokens can lead to token compromise and unauthorized API access.
    *   **Threat:**  Stolen API tokens can be used to bypass authentication and perform actions programmatically, potentially leading to data breaches or system manipulation.
*   **RBAC Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Threat:** Overly permissive roles or incorrectly assigned permissions can grant users unintended access to data or functionalities.
    *   **Threat:** Privilege escalation (horizontal or vertical) if vulnerabilities exist in the RBAC implementation or if roles are not properly managed.
*   **Data Source Permission Sync Issues:**
    *   **Threat:**  Discrepancies between Metabase permissions and underlying data source permissions can lead to users bypassing Metabase's access controls and directly accessing data sources with insufficient authorization logging.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
