# Deep Analysis: Authentication Bypass/Weak Authentication in Metabase

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Authentication Bypass/Weak Authentication" attack surface of a Metabase application.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview already provided.  This analysis will focus on practical aspects relevant to both developers and administrators.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the authentication mechanisms *directly* managed by or integrated with Metabase.  This includes:

*   **Local Metabase Authentication:**  Username/password authentication managed directly within Metabase.
*   **External Authentication Integrations:**  SSO (Single Sign-On) providers (e.g., Google, Okta, Azure AD), LDAP/Active Directory integrations.
*   **API Token Authentication:**  Use of API tokens for programmatic access to Metabase.
*   **Session Management:** How Metabase handles user sessions after successful authentication (and how this could be exploited).
*   **Password Reset Mechanisms:**  The process for users to recover forgotten passwords.

We *exclude* vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (e.g., operating system vulnerabilities, network misconfigurations) *unless* they directly impact Metabase's authentication process.  We also exclude vulnerabilities in third-party SSO providers themselves, focusing on the *integration* with Metabase.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will examine relevant sections of the Metabase codebase (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities in authentication logic, session management, and integration with external providers.  This is *targeted* code review, focusing on known areas of concern.
*   **Configuration Review:**  We will analyze common Metabase configuration settings related to authentication, identifying potentially weak or insecure defaults and common misconfigurations.
*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated):**  We will describe *simulated* penetration testing techniques that could be used to exploit authentication weaknesses.  This will *not* involve actual penetration testing of a live system without explicit authorization.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios related to authentication bypass.
*   **Best Practice Analysis:**  We will compare Metabase's authentication features and configuration options against industry best practices for secure authentication.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Local Metabase Authentication

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weak Password Storage:**  Outdated or insecure hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1) used to store passwords.  Lack of salting or insufficient salt length.  Metabase uses `bcrypt` which is good, but we need to verify the cost factor.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Lack of account lockout mechanisms or rate limiting on login attempts.  This allows attackers to try many passwords quickly.
    *   **Predictable Password Reset Tokens:**  If password reset tokens are generated using a predictable algorithm or have short lifespans, attackers could guess them.
    *   **Session Fixation:**  If Metabase doesn't generate a new session ID after successful login, an attacker could hijack a pre-authenticated session.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  If session cookies are not properly secured (e.g., missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags), they could be stolen via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Password Reset:**  If the password reset process allows an attacker to change another user's password by manipulating a user ID or token, this is a critical vulnerability.

*   **Code Review Focus (Metabase):**
    *   Examine `src/metabase/api/session.clj` and related files for session management logic.  Check for session ID generation, cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), and session timeout handling.
    *   Examine `src/metabase/models/user.clj` and related files for password hashing (verify `bcrypt` and cost factor), password reset token generation, and account lockout implementation.
    *   Search for any hardcoded credentials or default passwords.

*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated):**
    *   Attempt brute-force attacks using tools like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder with common password lists.
    *   Test for account lockout behavior by repeatedly entering incorrect passwords.
    *   Attempt to reset a password and analyze the reset token for predictability.
    *   Use a browser's developer tools to inspect session cookies and check for security attributes.
    *   Attempt session fixation by setting a session cookie *before* authentication.
    *   Attempt IDOR attacks on the password reset functionality.

### 4.2. External Authentication Integrations (SSO/LDAP)

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Misconfigured Trust Relationships:**  If Metabase blindly trusts assertions from the SSO provider without proper validation, an attacker could forge authentication tokens.
    *   **Lack of Attribute Mapping Validation:**  If Metabase doesn't properly validate attributes received from the SSO provider (e.g., user roles, permissions), an attacker could escalate privileges.
    *   **Replay Attacks:**  If the SSO integration doesn't properly handle timestamps or nonces, an attacker could replay a previously valid authentication token.
    *   **LDAP Injection:**  If user input is used to construct LDAP queries without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious LDAP code to bypass authentication or extract information.
    *   **Insufficient Logging and Auditing:**  Lack of detailed logs from the SSO integration makes it difficult to detect and investigate attacks.

*   **Code Review Focus (Metabase):**
    *   Examine the code responsible for handling SSO callbacks (e.g., SAML, OAuth 2.0).  Check for proper validation of signatures, timestamps, and attributes.
    *   Examine the code responsible for integrating with LDAP/Active Directory.  Check for proper escaping of user input in LDAP queries.
    *   Look for any configuration options related to trust settings for external providers.

*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated):**
    *   Attempt to forge SAML assertions or OAuth 2.0 tokens.
    *   Attempt to replay previously valid authentication tokens.
    *   Attempt LDAP injection attacks by providing specially crafted usernames or passwords.
    *   Review the configuration of the SSO provider itself (outside of Metabase) for weaknesses.

### 4.3. API Token Authentication

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weak Token Generation:**  If API tokens are generated using a predictable algorithm or have low entropy, they could be guessed.
    *   **Insecure Token Storage:**  If API tokens are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text in the database, in client-side code), they could be compromised.
    *   **Lack of Token Revocation:**  If there's no mechanism to revoke API tokens, a compromised token could be used indefinitely.
    *   **Overly Permissive Tokens:**  If API tokens grant excessive permissions, a compromised token could lead to significant damage.

*   **Code Review Focus (Metabase):**
    *   Examine the code responsible for generating and managing API tokens.  Check for the use of cryptographically secure random number generators.
    *   Examine how API tokens are stored and validated.
    *   Check for token revocation mechanisms.

*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated):**
    *   Attempt to guess API tokens.
    *   Attempt to use a revoked API token.
    *   Attempt to use an API token to access resources beyond its intended scope.

### 4.4. Session Management (Cross-cutting)

* **Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Long Session Timeouts:** Sessions that remain active for extended periods increase the window of opportunity for attackers.
    * **Lack of Idle Timeouts:**  Sessions should automatically terminate after a period of inactivity.
    * **Concurrent Session Limits:**  Not limiting the number of concurrent sessions for a user can allow an attacker to maintain access even if the user changes their password.
    * **Missing Session Termination on Logout:**  Ensure that logging out properly invalidates the session on the server-side.

* **Code Review Focus:**
    * Review session configuration parameters (timeout values, idle timeouts).
    * Verify that session termination occurs correctly on logout and password changes.

* **Penetration Testing:**
    * Test session timeout behavior.
    * Attempt to use a session after logging out.
    * Attempt to maintain multiple concurrent sessions.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable)

The following mitigation strategies go beyond the initial high-level recommendations:

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies (Beyond Basics):**
    *   **Minimum Length:**  12 characters or more.
    *   **Complexity:**  Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Password Blacklists:**  Prevent the use of common passwords and dictionary words (using a regularly updated blacklist).
    *   **Password History:**  Prevent reuse of recent passwords.
    *   **Password Expiration:**  Force password changes every 90 days (or less, depending on risk assessment).

*   **Implement Robust Account Lockout:**
    *   **Lockout Threshold:**  Lock accounts after 3-5 failed login attempts.
    *   **Lockout Duration:**  Lock accounts for a significant period (e.g., 30 minutes, increasing with subsequent failed attempts).
    *   **Lockout Notification:**  Notify users via email when their account is locked.
    *   **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts to deter automated brute-force attacks.

*   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Prioritize MFA:**  Make MFA *mandatory* for all users, especially administrators.
    *   **Supported Methods:**  Support multiple MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, SMS, push notifications) to accommodate different user preferences and security needs.
    *   **Bypass Prevention:**  Ensure that MFA cannot be easily bypassed (e.g., through password reset flows).

*   **Secure Session Management:**
    *   **Short Session Timeouts:**  Set session timeouts to a reasonable value (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity).
    *   **Idle Timeouts:**  Implement idle timeouts that terminate sessions after a shorter period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes).
    *   **HttpOnly and Secure Flags:**  Ensure that session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set.
    *   **SameSite Attribute:**  Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` to mitigate CSRF attacks.
    *   **Session Regeneration:**  Generate a new session ID after successful login and after any privilege level change.
    *   **Concurrent Session Control:**  Limit the number of concurrent sessions per user.

*   **Secure External Authentication Integrations:**
    *   **Validate Assertions:**  Thoroughly validate all assertions received from SSO providers (signatures, timestamps, audience restrictions, etc.).
    *   **Attribute Mapping:**  Carefully map attributes from the SSO provider to Metabase roles and permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit the configuration of SSO integrations and review logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **LDAP Security:**  Use parameterized queries or LDAP libraries that automatically escape user input to prevent LDAP injection.

*   **Secure API Token Management:**
    *   **Strong Token Generation:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create API tokens.
    *   **Secure Storage:**  Store API tokens securely (e.g., hashed in the database).
    *   **Token Revocation:**  Implement a mechanism to revoke API tokens.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant API tokens only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Token Rotation:**  Implement a mechanism for automatic or manual API token rotation.

*   **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Log All Authentication Events:**  Log all successful and failed login attempts, password resets, and SSO interactions.
    *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Implement alerts for unusual login patterns (e.g., multiple failed logins from the same IP address, logins from unusual locations).
    *   **Regular Log Review:**  Regularly review authentication logs to identify potential attacks.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests (with proper authorization) to identify and address vulnerabilities.

* **Stay Up-to-Date:** Keep Metabase and all its dependencies (including libraries used for authentication) up-to-date with the latest security patches.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Authentication Bypass/Weak Authentication" attack surface in Metabase, along with actionable steps to mitigate the associated risks. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance the security of their Metabase deployments.
