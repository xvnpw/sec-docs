Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Secure Metabase Application Configuration" mitigation strategy.

## Deep Analysis: Secure Metabase Application Configuration

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Secure Metabase Application Configuration" mitigation strategy in reducing the identified cybersecurity risks to the Metabase application.  This includes assessing the completeness of the strategy, identifying gaps in its current implementation, and recommending specific actions to enhance its effectiveness.  We aim to move beyond a simple checklist and understand *why* each configuration setting is important and how it contributes to the overall security posture.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Secure Metabase Application Configuration" mitigation strategy as described.  It will cover all six sub-points within the strategy:

1.  Application Database Password
2.  Public Sharing
3.  Embedding
4.  Session Timeout
5.  Audit Logs
6.  Disable Unused Features

The analysis will consider the threats mitigated, the impact of mitigation, the current implementation status, and the missing implementation elements.  It will *not* cover other potential mitigation strategies (e.g., network security, server hardening) except where they directly interact with the application configuration.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  For each configuration item, we'll revisit the threat model to ensure the stated threats are accurate and complete.  We'll consider additional attack vectors if necessary.
2.  **Implementation Verification:** We'll detail how to verify the current implementation status of each configuration item, going beyond the high-level "Mostly" or "Missing" statements.
3.  **Gap Analysis:** We'll identify specific gaps in the current implementation and the potential consequences of those gaps.
4.  **Recommendation Generation:** For each gap, we'll provide concrete, actionable recommendations for remediation, including specific commands, configuration settings, or process changes.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:** After outlining recommendations, we'll briefly discuss any remaining residual risk even after full implementation of the strategy.
6.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will check if there are any dependencies between configuration items.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

Let's break down each configuration item:

**2.1 Application Database Password**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  The primary threat is unauthorized access to the Metabase application database.  A weak or default password allows attackers to bypass Metabase's authentication and directly access/modify application data (users, dashboards, settings, etc.).  This is a *critical* vulnerability.  The threat model is accurate.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Connect to the PostgreSQL database using a database client (e.g., `psql`).  Attempt to connect with common default credentials (e.g., `postgres`/`postgres`).  If successful, the password is weak.  Examine the `pg_hba.conf` file to ensure strong authentication methods are enforced (e.g., `md5`, `scram-sha-256`).
    *   **MySQL:** Similar to PostgreSQL, attempt to connect with default credentials. Check the user table for password hashing algorithms (should be strong, like `caching_sha2_password`).
*   **Gap Analysis:**  The current implementation states a "strong password" is used with PostgreSQL.  We need to *verify* this strength (length, complexity, randomness) and ensure it's not reused elsewhere.  We also need to confirm the authentication method in `pg_hba.conf`.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Verify Password Strength:** Use a password auditing tool (e.g., John the Ripper, Hashcat) against a *copy* of the database user's hash (if obtainable) to assess its strength.  If the password is weak, generate a new, strong password (at least 16 characters, mixed-case, numbers, symbols) using a password manager.
    *   **Enforce Strong Authentication:**  In `pg_hba.conf`, ensure the authentication method for the Metabase user is set to `scram-sha-256` (preferred) or `md5`.  Restart PostgreSQL after making changes.
    *   **Document Password Management:**  Document the password, its generation method, and its storage location (secure password manager).
*   **Residual Risk:** Even with a strong password, brute-force attacks are still *possible*, though significantly less likely.  Consider implementing rate limiting on database connections.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** None.

**2.2 Public Sharing**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:** Public sharing allows anyone with a link to access dashboards or questions *without* authentication.  This is a major data exposure risk.  The threat model is accurate.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   Access the Metabase Admin Panel > Settings > General.  Visually confirm that "Public Sharing" is *disabled*.
    *   Attempt to access a previously shared public link (if one exists).  It should *not* work.
*   **Gap Analysis:** The current implementation states this is correctly configured.  We need to confirm this visually and by attempting to access a previously shared link.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically (e.g., monthly) review the "Public Sharing" setting to ensure it remains disabled.
    *   **Training:** Educate Metabase users about the risks of public sharing and the importance of using proper authentication methods.
*   **Residual Risk:**  Low, assuming the setting remains disabled and users are aware of the risks.  Accidental re-enablement is the primary concern.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** None.

**2.3 Embedding**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:** Unauthenticated embedding allows embedding Metabase dashboards/questions in *any* website without authentication.  This is a significant data exposure risk, similar to public sharing.  Signed embedding, with a strong secret key, mitigates this by requiring a valid signature for embedded content to be displayed.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   Access the Metabase Admin Panel > Settings > Embedding in other Applications.  Visually confirm that "Unauthenticated Embedding" is *disabled*.
    *   If "Signed Embedding" is used, locate the secret key.  Verify it is stored *securely* (e.g., in environment variables, a secrets management service) and is *not* hardcoded in the Metabase application or source code.  Verify the key's strength (long, random).
    *   Attempt to embed a Metabase dashboard/question without a valid signature (if signed embedding is used).  It should *not* work.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  The current implementation states "Unauthenticated embedding is enabled." This is a *critical* gap.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Disable Unauthenticated Embedding:**  Immediately disable "Unauthenticated Embedding" in the Metabase Admin Panel.
    *   **Implement Signed Embedding (If Needed):** If embedding is required, enable "Signed Embedding." Generate a strong, random secret key (at least 32 characters) using a secure random number generator (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32`).  Store this key *outside* of Metabase, preferably in environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).  Update any embedding code to use the signed embedding method with the secret key.
    *   **Document Key Management:** Document the secret key, its generation method, and its storage location.
*   **Residual Risk:**  If signed embedding is used, the primary risk is compromise of the secret key.  Proper key management and rotation are crucial.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** If embedding is not needed, this setting is independent. If embedding is needed, this setting depends on proper secret key management.

**2.4 Session Timeout**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  A long session timeout increases the window for session hijacking.  An attacker who gains access to a valid session cookie can impersonate the user until the session expires.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   Access the Metabase Admin Panel > Settings > General.  Visually confirm the "Session Timeout" value (e.g., 30 minutes).
    *   Log in to Metabase and remain inactive for longer than the configured timeout.  Verify that you are automatically logged out.
*   **Gap Analysis:** The current implementation states this is configured correctly.  We need to confirm the value and test the timeout behavior.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Regular Review:** Periodically review the "Session Timeout" setting to ensure it remains appropriate.
    *   **Consider Shorter Timeouts:**  For highly sensitive data, consider a shorter timeout (e.g., 15 minutes).
*   **Residual Risk:**  Session hijacking is still possible within the timeout window.  HTTPS and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure) are essential to further mitigate this risk.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** None.

**2.5 Audit Logs**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:** Audit logs provide a record of user activity, which is crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents.  Without logs, it's difficult to determine what happened after a breach.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   Access the Metabase Admin Panel > Settings > Audit.  Visually confirm that audit logging is *enabled*.
    *   Examine the Metabase logs (location depends on deployment method) to ensure they are being generated and contain relevant information (user actions, timestamps, IP addresses, etc.).
    *   Check if external log collection is configured (e.g., sending logs to a SIEM system).
*   **Gap Analysis:** The current implementation states audit logging is enabled, but "analysis is not automated." This is a significant gap.  Logs are useless if they are not analyzed.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Automated Log Analysis:** Implement automated log analysis using a SIEM system (e.g., Splunk, ELK stack) or a dedicated log analysis tool.  Configure alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized data access, changes to security settings).
    *   **Log Retention Policy:** Define a log retention policy that complies with relevant regulations and business requirements.
    *   **Regular Log Review:** Even with automated analysis, perform regular manual reviews of the logs to identify any anomalies that might be missed by automated rules.
    *   **External Log Collection:** Configure Metabase to send logs to an external system for centralized logging and analysis. This improves security and resilience.
*   **Residual Risk:**  Attackers may attempt to tamper with or delete logs.  Proper log security (access controls, integrity monitoring) is essential.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** Effective audit log analysis depends on having a SIEM or log analysis tool in place.

**2.6 Disable Unused Features**

*   **Threat Modeling Review:** Unused features increase the attack surface of the application.  Vulnerabilities in unused components can be exploited even if they are not actively used.
*   **Implementation Verification:**
    *   Access the Metabase Admin Panel and review all available features, especially database drivers.
    *   Identify any features that are *not* being used.
    *   Check for any configuration options to disable these features.
*   **Gap Analysis:** The current implementation states "Unused features haven't been reviewed." This is a gap.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Feature Inventory:** Create a list of all available features in Metabase.
    *   **Disable Unused Drivers:** In the Metabase Admin Panel, disable any database drivers that are not being used.
    *   **Disable Other Features:** If possible, disable any other unused features (e.g., specific authentication methods, integrations).  Consult the Metabase documentation for instructions.
    *   **Regular Review:** Periodically review the list of enabled features and disable any that are no longer needed.
*   **Residual Risk:**  Zero-day vulnerabilities in enabled features could still be exploited.  Regular security updates are crucial.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** None.

### 4. Conclusion

The "Secure Metabase Application Configuration" mitigation strategy is a crucial component of securing a Metabase deployment.  However, the current implementation has significant gaps, particularly regarding unauthenticated embedding and automated audit log analysis.  By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data exposure, and other security threats.  Regular security reviews and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
