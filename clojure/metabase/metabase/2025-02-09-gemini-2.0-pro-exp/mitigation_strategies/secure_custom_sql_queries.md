Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Secure Custom SQL Queries" mitigation strategy for Metabase, following the structure you requested:

# Deep Analysis: Secure Custom SQL Queries in Metabase

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Secure Custom SQL Queries" mitigation strategy in protecting a Metabase instance against the identified threats.  This includes assessing the current implementation, identifying gaps, and recommending concrete improvements to strengthen the security posture.  We aim to move from a "partially implemented" state to a robust, well-documented, and consistently enforced security practice.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Secure Custom SQL Queries" mitigation strategy as described.  It encompasses:

*   **Technical Controls:**  Metabase's built-in permission system and query builder features.
*   **Procedural Controls:**  User training, code review processes, and informal guidance.
*   **Threats:** SQL Injection, Data Breach, Data Modification/Destruction, and Denial of Service, specifically as they relate to custom SQL query usage.
*   **Metabase Version:**  The analysis assumes a reasonably up-to-date version of Metabase, reflecting the capabilities of the linked repository (https://github.com/metabase/metabase).  Specific version dependencies will be noted if they arise.

This analysis *does not* cover other Metabase security aspects (e.g., authentication, network security, general database security best practices) except where they directly intersect with custom SQL query security.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Requirement Decomposition:** Break down the mitigation strategy into its individual components (Restrict Access, Parameterized Queries, Code Review, Limit Complexity, Use Views).
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each component, analyze how it specifically addresses the identified threats.  This will involve considering attack vectors and how the control mitigates them.
3.  **Gap Analysis:**  Compare the "Currently Implemented" status against the ideal implementation, identifying specific weaknesses and missing elements.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the residual risk after considering the current implementation and identified gaps.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to address the gaps and reduce the residual risk.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.
6.  **Documentation Review:** Examine existing Metabase documentation and community resources to ensure recommendations align with best practices and supported features.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Restrict Access (Admin Panel)

*   **Requirement:** Limit the ability to write custom SQL queries to a small, trusted group of users via Metabase's Admin Panel > Permissions.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the number of users who *could* introduce vulnerable code.
    *   **Data Breach/Modification/Destruction:**  Reduces the likelihood of malicious or accidental data compromise by limiting access to powerful SQL capabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Reduces the risk of poorly written queries impacting performance, as fewer users can execute arbitrary SQL.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  This component is "partially implemented."  While access is restricted, the analysis needs to confirm:
    *   **Granularity of Restriction:**  Is the restriction applied at the *database* level, as recommended?  Are there any unintended loopholes?
    *   **Group Membership:**  Is the "trusted group" clearly defined and regularly reviewed?  Are users removed promptly when their roles change?
    *   **Audit Trail:**  Are changes to permissions logged and auditable?
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Medium.  While access is restricted, the lack of rigorous group management and auditing introduces potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Document the "Trusted Group":** Create a formal document listing the users authorized to write custom SQL, their roles, and the justification for their access.
    2.  **Regular Review:**  Implement a quarterly (or more frequent) review of the "trusted group" membership.
    3.  **Automated Alerts:**  Configure Metabase (or a separate monitoring system) to alert administrators of any changes to SQL query permissions.
    4.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure that users only have access to the specific databases they need.

### 2.2 Parameterized Queries (User Training & Metabase Features)

*   **Requirement:** Train users with custom SQL access to *always* use parameterized queries. Leverage Metabase's query builder to assist.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  This is the *primary* defense against SQL injection.  Parameterized queries prevent user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
    *   **Data Breach/Modification/Destruction:**  By preventing SQL injection, parameterized queries indirectly protect against these threats.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  This component is "partially implemented."  Users are "generally aware," but formal training is missing.  This is a *critical* gap.
    *   **Training Content:**  Does the training cover *why* parameterized queries are necessary, demonstrating the risks of SQL injection?
    *   **Practical Exercises:**  Does the training include hands-on exercises where users practice writing parameterized queries?
    *   **Metabase-Specific Guidance:**  Does the training show how to use Metabase's query builder to create parameterized queries effectively?
    *   **Ongoing Reinforcement:**  Is there a mechanism to reinforce the importance of parameterized queries after the initial training?
*   **Risk Assessment:**  High.  The lack of formal training significantly increases the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Develop Formal Training:** Create a comprehensive training module on parameterized queries, including:
        *   Clear explanations of SQL injection risks.
        *   Practical examples and exercises.
        *   Specific guidance on using Metabase's features.
        *   A quiz or assessment to verify understanding.
    2.  **Mandatory Training:**  Make this training mandatory for all users granted custom SQL access.
    3.  **Regular Refresher Training:**  Conduct refresher training annually (or more frequently).
    4.  **Documentation:**  Create clear, concise documentation on parameterized queries within Metabase, easily accessible to users.
    5. **Metabase Native Question Validation:** Explore Metabase's built-in features for validating native queries. This might include warnings or restrictions on queries that appear to be concatenating strings instead of using parameters.

### 2.3 Code Review (Process, Outside Metabase)

*   **Requirement:** Implement a code review process for custom SQL queries.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  A second layer of defense, catching potential vulnerabilities missed by the user.
    *   **Data Breach/Modification/Destruction:**  Reduces the risk of malicious or accidental data compromise.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Helps identify and prevent poorly optimized queries.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  This component is "not implemented."  This is a significant gap.
    *   **Review Process:**  What tools and procedures will be used for code review?  (e.g., Git, pull requests, dedicated review tools)
    *   **Reviewers:**  Who will be responsible for reviewing custom SQL queries?  Do they have the necessary expertise?
    *   **Review Criteria:**  What specific criteria will be used to evaluate the security and performance of the queries?
*   **Risk Assessment:**  High.  The lack of code review increases the risk of vulnerabilities and performance issues.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Establish a Code Review Process:**  Implement a formal process for reviewing custom SQL queries *before* they are deployed to production.  This could involve:
        *   Using a version control system (like Git) and requiring pull requests for all custom SQL changes.
        *   Designating specific individuals as code reviewers.
        *   Creating a checklist of security and performance considerations for reviewers.
    2.  **Automated Static Analysis:**  Explore the possibility of using static analysis tools to automatically scan custom SQL code for potential vulnerabilities.

### 2.4 Limit Complexity (Informal Guidance)

*   **Requirement:** Advise users to avoid overly complex queries.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Complex queries are more likely to consume excessive resources and impact performance.
    *   **SQL Injection (Indirectly):**  Complex queries can be harder to understand and review, increasing the chance of overlooking vulnerabilities.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  This component is "informal."  This makes it difficult to enforce and track.
    *   **Definition of "Complex":**  There's no clear definition of what constitutes an "overly complex" query.
    *   **Enforcement Mechanism:**  There's no mechanism to prevent users from writing complex queries.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Medium.  While informal guidance is better than nothing, it's not a reliable control.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Develop Complexity Guidelines:**  Create more specific guidelines for query complexity, perhaps using metrics like:
        *   Number of joins.
        *   Number of subqueries.
        *   Use of complex functions.
    2.  **Performance Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring to identify and investigate queries that consume excessive resources.
    3.  **Query Optimization Training:**  Provide training on query optimization techniques to help users write efficient queries.

### 2.5 Use Views (Informal Guidance)

*   **Requirement:** Encourage the use of database views instead of complex custom SQL.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Indirectly):**  Views can encapsulate complex logic, reducing the need for users to write custom SQL.
    *   **Data Breach/Modification/Destruction (Indirectly):**  Views can restrict access to specific columns and rows, enhancing data security.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Views can be pre-optimized, improving performance.
*   **Gap Analysis:**  This component is "informal."  Similar to complexity limits, this lacks enforceability.
    *   **View Creation Process:**  Is there a process for requesting and creating new views?
    *   **View Management:**  Are views properly documented and maintained?
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Low.  While informal, encouraging view usage is generally beneficial.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Promote View Usage:**  Actively promote the use of views in training and documentation.
    2.  **Streamline View Creation:**  Establish a clear process for users to request and create new views.
    3.  **Document Existing Views:**  Ensure that existing views are well-documented and easily discoverable by users.

## 3. Overall Risk Assessment and Prioritized Recommendations

**Overall Risk Assessment:**  The current implementation of the "Secure Custom SQL Queries" mitigation strategy has significant gaps, resulting in a **High** overall risk.  The lack of formal parameterized query training and code review are the most critical concerns.
