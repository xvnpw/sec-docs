Okay, let's break down the "Strict Database User Permissions" mitigation strategy for Metabase, performing a deep analysis as requested.

## Deep Analysis: Strict Database User Permissions for Metabase

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and implementation gaps of the "Strict Database User Permissions" mitigation strategy within the context of our Metabase deployment.  We aim to identify specific actions needed to fully implement this strategy and achieve the highest level of risk reduction against data breaches, data modification/destruction, and privilege escalation.  A secondary objective is to establish a repeatable process for ongoing monitoring and improvement.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Strict Database User Permissions" strategy as described.  It encompasses:

*   The database user account used by Metabase to connect to the underlying data source (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
*   The permissions granted to this user account *within the database itself*.
*   The configuration of the Metabase database connection to utilize this user account.
*   The process for auditing and maintaining these permissions.
*   The interaction between Metabase's internal permission system and the database-level permissions.  (While Metabase has its own permission system, this analysis prioritizes the *database* level, as it's the ultimate gatekeeper.)

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other Metabase security features (e.g., authentication, session management, application-level permissions).  These are important, but outside the scope of *this specific* mitigation strategy.
*   Network-level security (firewalls, etc.).
*   Operating system security.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Requirements Gathering:**  Review existing documentation (if any) on Metabase data access needs.  Interview stakeholders (data analysts, business users) to understand which data sources are *essential* for their Metabase usage.
2.  **Database Permission Review:**  Directly inspect the database user's permissions using database-specific tools (e.g., `psql` for PostgreSQL, `mysql` client for MySQL).  This will provide a definitive view of the *current* state.
3.  **Gap Analysis:**  Compare the current permissions against the ideal state (Principle of Least Privilege).  Identify specific tables, views, or functions where permissions are overly broad.
4.  **Implementation Plan:**  Develop a step-by-step plan to remediate the identified gaps, including specific database commands (e.g., `REVOKE`, `GRANT`).
5.  **Testing Plan:**  Outline a testing procedure to verify that the changes:
    *   Do not break existing Metabase functionality (dashboards, questions).
    *   Effectively prevent access to unauthorized data.
6.  **Audit Procedure:**  Define a schedule and process for regularly auditing the database user's permissions.
7.  **Documentation:**  Thoroughly document the entire process, including findings, implementation steps, and audit procedures.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1.  Current State Assessment (Based on "Currently Implemented: Partially")**

*   **Dedicated User Exists:**  This is a positive first step.  Having a separate user account for Metabase, rather than using a highly privileged account (like a database administrator), is crucial.
*   **Overly Broad `SELECT` Permissions:** This is the *critical* vulnerability.  While the user is dedicated, granting `SELECT` access to *all* tables in the database defeats the purpose of least privilege.  If Metabase is compromised, an attacker could potentially access *any* data in the database.
*   **No Regular Audits:**  This is a significant weakness.  Permissions can "drift" over time (e.g., new tables are added, and the Metabase user automatically gets access).  Regular audits are essential to ensure that the principle of least privilege is maintained.

**2.2.  Threat Model Refinement**

The provided threat model is accurate, but we can refine it further:

*   **Data Breach (Severity: Critical):**  With overly broad `SELECT` permissions, a compromised Metabase instance becomes a direct pathway to *all* data in the connected database.  The attacker doesn't need to exploit further vulnerabilities; they already have read access.  This includes sensitive data that might not even be *intended* for use in Metabase.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction (Severity: Critical):** While the current strategy aims to prevent this by limiting to `SELECT`, it's crucial to ensure *absolutely no* write permissions are granted (even accidentally).  We need to verify this explicitly.  Furthermore, some databases might have stored procedures or functions that could be exploited even with `SELECT`-only access.  This needs investigation.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):**  Even with `SELECT`-only access, an attacker might try to leverage that access to find vulnerabilities in the database itself or in other applications that use the same database.  Restricting access to only necessary tables minimizes the attack surface for such escalation attempts.
*   **Indirect Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Even if direct access is restricted, an attacker might be able to infer sensitive information through carefully crafted queries. For example, if they can query a table that contains order totals, they might be able to deduce information about individual orders even if they can't see the order details directly. This is harder to mitigate, but minimizing the accessible data reduces the risk.

**2.3.  Implementation Gap Analysis**

The primary gaps are:

1.  **Overly Permissive `SELECT`:**  The Metabase user needs to be restricted to the *minimum* set of tables and views required for its operation.
2.  **Lack of a Defined Data Access Inventory:**  We need a clear, documented list of which Metabase questions, dashboards, and collections require access to which specific database objects.
3.  **Absence of an Audit Process:**  No formal process exists to regularly review and verify the database user's permissions.
4.  **Potential for Stored Procedure/Function Exploitation:** We need to verify that no stored procedures or functions grant unintended write access or leak sensitive information.

**2.4.  Implementation Plan**

Here's a detailed implementation plan:

1.  **Data Access Inventory:**
    *   **Step 1.1:**  Identify all active Metabase questions, dashboards, and collections.
    *   **Step 1.2:**  For each item, analyze the underlying SQL queries (Metabase provides tools to view this).
    *   **Step 1.3:**  Document the specific tables and views accessed by each item.
    *   **Step 1.4:**  Consolidate this information into a single "Data Access Inventory" document. This document should map Metabase objects to required database objects.

2.  **Permission Remediation (PostgreSQL Example - Adapt for your specific database):**
    *   **Step 2.1:**  Connect to the database as a superuser or user with sufficient privileges to modify permissions.
    *   **Step 2.2:**  `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM metabase_user;` (Replace `public` with the relevant schema and `metabase_user` with your Metabase user's name).  This starts from a clean slate.
    *   **Step 2.3:**  Iterate through the Data Access Inventory. For each required table/view:
        *   `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE schema_name.table_name TO metabase_user;` (Replace with the actual schema and table/view names).
    *   **Step 2.4:**  If views are used, ensure the underlying tables are *not* also granted `SELECT` access unless specifically required.
    *   **Step 2.5:**  `REVOKE USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public FROM metabase_user;` (Prevent potential sequence manipulation).
    *   **Step 2.6:**  Review all stored procedures and functions.  If any are accessible to the Metabase user and could potentially modify data or leak sensitive information, revoke execute permissions: `REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION function_name FROM metabase_user;`

3.  **Testing:**
    *   **Step 3.1:**  Connect to Metabase using the configured connection.
    *   **Step 3.2:**  Verify that all existing dashboards and questions from the Data Access Inventory function correctly.
    *   **Step 3.3:**  Attempt to create new questions accessing tables *not* listed in the Data Access Inventory.  These should fail.
    *   **Step 3.4:**  Attempt to execute any SQL queries directly (if Metabase allows this) that attempt to modify data.  These should fail.

4.  **Audit Procedure:**
    *   **Step 4.1:**  Schedule a recurring audit (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    *   **Step 4.2:**  During the audit:
        *   Connect to the database as a superuser.
        *   Use database-specific commands to list the permissions of the Metabase user (e.g., `\du+ metabase_user` in PostgreSQL).
        *   Compare the current permissions against the Data Access Inventory.
        *   Document any discrepancies and remediate them immediately.
        *   Review any new tables or views added to the database and update the Data Access Inventory and permissions accordingly.

5. **Documentation:**
    * Create detailed documentation of all steps, including:
        * The Data Access Inventory.
        * The specific SQL commands used to grant and revoke permissions.
        * The testing procedures.
        * The audit schedule and procedures.
        * Any deviations from the standard procedure (e.g., if a specific dashboard requires temporary elevated privileges).

**2.5.  Potential Challenges and Considerations**

*   **Complex Queries:**  Some Metabase questions might use complex SQL queries that are difficult to analyze.  You might need to break down these queries into smaller parts to identify the underlying table dependencies.
*   **Dynamic SQL:**  If Metabase uses dynamic SQL (where the SQL query is constructed at runtime), it might be more challenging to determine the exact data access needs.  You might need to use database auditing tools to capture the actual queries being executed.
*   **Third-Party Integrations:**  If Metabase integrates with other systems, you need to consider the data access needs of those integrations.
*   **Database-Specific Syntax:**  The SQL commands for granting and revoking permissions vary slightly between different database systems.  You need to use the correct syntax for your specific database.
*   **Performance Impact:**  In very large databases, granting permissions on a table-by-table basis *could* have a minor performance impact.  However, this is usually negligible compared to the security benefits.
*   **Metabase Updates:** Metabase updates *might* introduce new features that require access to additional database objects. You need to review the release notes for each update and update the Data Access Inventory and permissions accordingly.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Strict Database User Permissions" strategy is a *critical* component of securing a Metabase deployment.  The current partial implementation leaves a significant vulnerability.  By fully implementing the strategy, including creating a detailed Data Access Inventory, restricting permissions to the absolute minimum, and establishing a regular audit process, we can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, data modification, and privilege escalation.  The detailed implementation plan provided above offers a concrete roadmap to achieve this goal. The key is to be meticulous, document everything, and regularly review and update the permissions to maintain a strong security posture.
