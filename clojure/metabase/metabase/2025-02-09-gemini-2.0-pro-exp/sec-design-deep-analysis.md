## Deep Security Analysis of Metabase

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The objective of this deep analysis is to conduct a thorough security assessment of Metabase's key components, identify potential vulnerabilities, and provide actionable mitigation strategies.  The analysis will focus on:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  How Metabase handles user authentication, session management, and access control to resources and data.
*   **Data Handling and Storage:**  How Metabase interacts with connected databases, manages its own application data, and protects data in transit and at rest.
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  How Metabase prevents injection attacks (SQLi, XSS) and other common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** How Metabase manages its dependencies and mitigates supply chain risks.
*   **Deployment and Configuration:**  Security considerations for deploying and configuring Metabase, particularly in self-managed scenarios.
*   **API Security:** How the Metabase API is secured.
*   **Audit Logging:** How Metabase logs security-relevant events.

**Scope:**

This analysis covers the open-source Metabase application, focusing on the core components and functionalities described in the provided security design review.  It considers both the Metabase application itself and its interactions with external systems (databases, authentication providers).  It does *not* cover the security of external databases themselves, assuming they are managed and secured separately.  It also does not cover Metabase Cloud specifically, although many of the same principles apply.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Architecture and Component Inference:**  Based on the provided C4 diagrams, documentation, and general knowledge of Metabase, we will infer the architecture, components, and data flow.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each key component, we will identify potential threats based on common attack patterns and Metabase-specific functionalities.  We will use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) as a guide.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will analyze potential vulnerabilities arising from the identified threats.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies tailored to Metabase.
5.  **Code Review (High-Level):** While a full code review is outside the scope, we will refer to general code structure and practices based on the GitHub repository to inform our analysis.

### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

#### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization

*   **Components:**  Web Application (Frontend), API Server (Backend), Application Database, External Authentication Providers (LDAP, Google Sign-In, JWT).
*   **Data Flow:**  User credentials (or tokens) flow from the Web Application to the API Server.  The API Server validates credentials against the Application Database or external providers.  Session tokens are issued and used for subsequent requests.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Spoofing:**  Attacker impersonates a legitimate user.
    *   **Tampering:**  Attacker modifies session tokens or user data.
    *   **Repudiation:**  User denies performing an action (lack of sufficient logging).
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of user credentials or session tokens.
    *   **Elevation of Privilege:**  User gains unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing:**  Attacker attempts to guess user credentials.
    *   **Session Fixation/Hijacking:** Attacker steals or manipulates a user's session.
    *   **Weak Password Policies:** Users choose easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Improper handling of JWT secrets:** If the JWT secret is compromised, attackers can forge valid tokens.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient password complexity enforcement.
    *   Vulnerable session management (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of secure cookies).
    *   Inadequate protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Improper validation of JWT tokens.
    *   Lack of granular access control (RBAC limitations).
    *   Insecure storage of user credentials in the Application Database.
    *   Vulnerabilities in external authentication provider integrations.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce strong password policies:**  Minimum length, complexity requirements, and password expiration.  Use a library like zxcvbn for password strength estimation.
    *   **Implement robust session management:**  Use cryptographically secure random session IDs, set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies, implement session timeouts, and consider using a well-vetted session management library.
    *   **Implement rate limiting and account lockout:**  Protect against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.  Consider CAPTCHA or other challenges.
    *   **Validate JWT tokens rigorously:**  Verify the signature, issuer, audience, and expiration.  Store the JWT secret securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management service, *never* in the codebase).  Rotate secrets regularly.
    *   **Implement fine-grained access control:**  Go beyond basic RBAC.  Consider attribute-based access control (ABAC) or data-level permissions.  Regularly review and audit user permissions.
    *   **Store user credentials securely:**  Use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 with a unique salt for each password.
    *   **Securely integrate with external authentication providers:**  Follow best practices for OAuth 2.0 and SAML.  Validate responses from providers carefully.
    *   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    *   **Use prepared statements or parameterized queries:** To prevent SQL injection when handling authentication data.

#### 2.2 Data Handling and Storage

*   **Components:**  API Server, Application Database, External Databases.
*   **Data Flow:**  Metabase connects to external databases using configured credentials.  Queries are executed, and results are returned to the API Server and then to the Web Application.  Metabase stores its own data (users, dashboards, etc.) in the Application Database.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Unauthorized access to data in external databases or the Application Database.
    *   **Tampering:**  Modification of data in external databases or the Application Database.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Attacker injects malicious SQL code through Metabase to access or modify data.
    *   **Data Breach:**  Large-scale exfiltration of data from external databases or the Application Database.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Overwhelming the database with requests, making it unavailable.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL injection vulnerabilities in Metabase's query building logic.**  This is a *critical* vulnerability to address.
    *   **Insecure storage of database connection credentials.**
    *   **Lack of encryption at rest for the Application Database.**
    *   **Insufficient access controls on the Application Database.**
    *   **Reliance on external database security without validation.**
    *   **Exposure of sensitive data in error messages or logs.**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with *any* database (both the Application Database and external databases).  This is the *primary* defense against SQL injection.  Thoroughly review all database interaction code.
    *   **Securely store database connection credentials:**  Use environment variables, a secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or a secure configuration file with appropriate permissions.  *Never* store credentials directly in the codebase.
    *   **Enable encryption at rest for the Application Database:**  Use the encryption features provided by the chosen database system (e.g., PostgreSQL's `pgcrypto` extension, MySQL's encryption functions).
    *   **Implement least privilege access to the Application Database:**  Create dedicated database users with only the necessary permissions.  Regularly review and audit database user permissions.
    *   **Validate external database security configurations:**  Provide guidance and tools to help users securely configure their external databases.  Consider offering a "security check" feature that identifies common misconfigurations.
    *   **Sanitize error messages and logs:**  Avoid exposing sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, SQL queries) in error messages or logs.  Use a logging framework that allows for redaction of sensitive information.
    *   **Implement database connection pooling:**  Manage database connections efficiently to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Monitor database activity:**  Use database auditing tools to track queries and identify suspicious activity.
    *   **Regularly back up the Application Database:**  Ensure data can be recovered in case of a security incident or system failure.

#### 2.3 Input Validation and Output Encoding

*   **Components:**  Web Application, API Server.
*   **Data Flow:**  User input is received by the Web Application and sent to the API Server.  The API Server processes the input and may generate output that is displayed in the Web Application.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Web Application.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Attacker injects malicious SQL code through user input.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:**  Command injection, LDAP injection, etc.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Attacker tricks a user into performing an unintended action.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient validation of user input on the client-side (Web Application) and server-side (API Server).
    *   Lack of output encoding when displaying data in the Web Application.
    *   Improper handling of special characters.
    *   Missing or misconfigured CSRF protection.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation:**  *Always* validate all user input on the server-side (API Server).  Use a whitelist approach (allow only known good characters) whenever possible.  Validate data types, lengths, and formats.
    *   **Client-Side Input Validation:**  Implement client-side validation as a first line of defense, but *never* rely on it for security.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output displayed in the Web Application to prevent XSS.  Use a context-aware encoding library (e.g., OWASP Java Encoder).  Encode data for the appropriate context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.  Define which sources of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) are allowed.
    *   **CSRF Protection:**  Use a CSRF token library or framework to generate and validate tokens for all state-changing requests.  Ensure tokens are tied to the user's session and are unpredictable.
    *   **HTTP Security Headers:**  Set appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) to enhance browser security.
    *   **Regular Expression Security:** If using regular expressions for validation, ensure they are not vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.
