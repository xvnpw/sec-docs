Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Compromise Metabase Authentication/Authorization" attack tree path, tailored for the Metabase application, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Compromise Metabase Authentication/Authorization

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Compromise Metabase Authentication/Authorization" attack path.  This involves identifying specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and potential mitigation strategies related to bypassing or subverting Metabase's security controls for user login and access permissions.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against these types of attacks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the authentication and authorization mechanisms *within* the Metabase application itself, as deployed in a typical production environment.  This includes:

*   **User Authentication:**  How users prove their identity (e.g., username/password, SSO, LDAP).
*   **Authorization:** How Metabase determines what resources and actions a user is permitted to access after successful authentication.
*   **Session Management:** How Metabase maintains user sessions and prevents session hijacking.
*   **API Authentication:** How API calls to Metabase are authenticated and authorized.
*   **Default Credentials:**  The presence and handling of default administrative or other privileged accounts.
*   **Password Reset Mechanisms:**  The security of the password reset process.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:**  Mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  The availability and effectiveness of MFA options.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** How Metabase implements and enforces RBAC.

This analysis *excludes* external factors like network-level attacks (e.g., DDoS) or physical security breaches, unless they directly contribute to compromising Metabase's authentication/authorization.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in underlying infrastructure (e.g., operating system vulnerabilities) unless they are specifically exploitable *through* Metabase.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threat actors and their motivations for targeting Metabase authentication/authorization.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine known vulnerabilities in Metabase (CVEs, public disclosures) and potential weaknesses in its authentication/authorization implementation.  This includes reviewing the Metabase source code (from the provided GitHub repository) for potential security flaws.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Detail specific attack vectors that could be used to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful attacks, considering data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities and reduce the likelihood and impact of attacks.
6.  **Detection Strategies:** Recommend methods for detecting attempts to compromise authentication/authorization.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

Potential threat actors targeting Metabase authentication/authorization include:

*   **External Attackers (Unskilled):**  Script kiddies using automated tools for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting known vulnerabilities.
*   **External Attackers (Skilled):**  Sophisticated attackers with knowledge of web application security, potentially targeting specific data within Metabase.
*   **Malicious Insiders:**  Disgruntled employees or contractors with legitimate access who attempt to escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.
*   **Compromised Insiders:**  Employees whose accounts have been compromised through phishing or other means.

Motivations include:

*   **Data Theft:**  Accessing sensitive business data, customer information, or financial records stored within Metabase.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Altering data within Metabase to cause financial loss, reputational damage, or operational disruption.
*   **System Compromise:**  Using Metabase as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems on the network.
*   **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the organization's infrastructure and data.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

This section will be broken down into specific vulnerability categories, referencing the Metabase codebase and known CVEs where applicable.

#### 2.2.1  Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing

*   **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient protection against automated login attempts.  This could be due to a lack of rate limiting, account lockout policies, or CAPTCHA implementation.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/api/auth.clj` (and related authentication endpoints) - Examine how login attempts are handled, rate-limited, and logged.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/models/user.clj` - Check for account lockout logic and password complexity requirements.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of username/password combinations (brute-force) or credentials obtained from data breaches (credential stuffing).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement robust account lockout policies:**  Lock accounts after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within 15 minutes).  Consider both IP-based and user-based lockouts.
    *   **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require a minimum password length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and prohibit common passwords.
    *   **Implement rate limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts per IP address and per user within a given time period.
    *   **Use CAPTCHA or similar challenges:**  Add a CAPTCHA to the login form to deter automated bots.
    *   **Monitor login logs:**  Implement robust logging of successful and failed login attempts, and alert on suspicious patterns.
    *   **Consider Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.

#### 2.2.2  Session Hijacking

*   **Vulnerability:**  Weak session management practices that allow an attacker to steal or predict a valid user session.  This could be due to:
    *   Predictable session IDs.
    *   Lack of secure flag on session cookies.
    *   Lack of HttpOnly flag on session cookies.
    *   Session fixation vulnerabilities.
    *   Insufficient session timeout.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/middleware/session.clj` - Examine how session IDs are generated, stored, and validated.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/server.clj` - Check for cookie configuration (secure, HttpOnly).
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker intercepts a user's session cookie (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack on an insecure network) or predicts a valid session ID.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use a strong, cryptographically secure random number generator for session IDs.**
    *   **Set the `Secure` flag on session cookies:**  This ensures that cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    *   **Set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies:**  This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS-based session theft.
    *   **Implement session timeout:**  Automatically invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity.
    *   **Use a framework that handles session management securely:**  Leverage the built-in session management features of the web framework (Ring/Compojure in Metabase's case) and ensure they are configured correctly.
    *   **Implement session fixation protection:**  Regenerate the session ID upon successful login.
    *   **Consider using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** This forces browsers to always use HTTPS.

#### 2.2.3  SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)

*   **Vulnerability:**  Although less common in modern frameworks, a SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication logic could allow an attacker to bypass authentication entirely.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/api/auth.clj` - Carefully examine any SQL queries used for authentication.  Ensure parameterized queries or an ORM are used *exclusively*.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/models/user.clj` - Review database interaction logic.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker crafts a malicious username or password that includes SQL code, which is then executed by the Metabase backend.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* SQL queries.**  This is the most effective defense against SQL injection.
    *   **Use an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM):**  ORMs typically handle SQL injection prevention automatically.  Metabase uses Toucan, which should provide this protection if used correctly.
    *   **Validate and sanitize all user input:**  Even with parameterized queries, it's good practice to validate and sanitize user input to prevent other types of attacks.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user Metabase uses has only the necessary permissions.

#### 2.2.4  Default Credentials

*   **Vulnerability:**  Metabase, or its underlying components, might have default administrative or other privileged accounts that are not changed during installation.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   Installation documentation and scripts.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/models/setting.clj` - Check for default settings related to user accounts.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uses well-known default credentials to gain access to Metabase.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Force password change on first login:**  Require users to change the default password for any administrative accounts immediately after installation.
    *   **Disable or remove unnecessary default accounts.**
    *   **Clearly document any default credentials and the importance of changing them.**

#### 2.2.5  Password Reset Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses in the password reset process can allow an attacker to gain access to a user's account.  This could include:
    *   Predictable password reset tokens.
    *   Lack of rate limiting on password reset requests.
    *   Exposure of sensitive information in password reset emails.
    *   Lack of email verification.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/api/auth.clj` - Examine the password reset endpoint and related logic.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/email.clj` - Review how password reset emails are generated and sent.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker requests a password reset for a target user's account and intercepts the reset token or uses a vulnerability in the reset process to set a new password.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use strong, cryptographically secure random number generators for password reset tokens.**
    *   **Set a short expiration time for password reset tokens.**
    *   **Implement rate limiting on password reset requests.**
    *   **Do not include sensitive information (e.g., the new password) in password reset emails.**
    *   **Require email verification before allowing a password reset.**
    *   **Log all password reset attempts.**

#### 2.2.6  Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **Vulnerability:**  The absence of MFA makes it easier for an attacker to gain access to an account even if they have the correct username and password.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/api/auth.clj` - Check for MFA-related code.
    *   Metabase documentation - Check for supported MFA methods.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker compromises a user's password through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means, and gains access to their Metabase account.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement support for MFA:**  Offer users the option to enable MFA using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) apps, security keys, or other strong authentication methods.
    *   **Encourage or require MFA for privileged users.**

#### 2.2.7  Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation)

*   **Vulnerability:**  Flaws in the authorization logic could allow a user to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to. This could be due to:
    *   Incorrectly configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    *   Missing authorization checks on API endpoints.
    *   IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review (Potential Areas):**
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/api/*` - Examine all API endpoints and ensure that appropriate authorization checks are in place.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/models/*` - Review how permissions are defined and enforced.
    *   `metabase/src/metabase/middleware/auth.clj` - Check authorization middleware.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A user with limited privileges manipulates API requests or URLs to access data or perform actions they should not be able to.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement robust RBAC:**  Define clear roles and permissions, and ensure that all resources and actions are protected by appropriate authorization checks.
    *   **Validate authorization on *every* API request:**  Do not rely on client-side validation.
    *   **Use indirect object references:**  Avoid exposing internal object IDs (e.g., database primary keys) directly in URLs or API responses.  Use a mapping or other indirect reference instead.
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regularly audit permissions and access controls.**

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful compromise of Metabase authentication/authorization can range from medium to high, depending on the attacker's goals and the sensitivity of the data stored in Metabase.

*   **Confidentiality:**  Sensitive business data, customer information, or financial records could be exposed.
*   **Integrity:**  Data could be altered or deleted, leading to financial loss, operational disruption, or reputational damage.
*   **Availability:**  The Metabase service could be made unavailable, disrupting business operations.

### 2.4 Mitigation Recommendations
