Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing" attack tree path, tailored for a Metabase deployment, following a structured cybersecurity analysis approach.

## Deep Analysis of Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attack on Metabase

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly assess the vulnerabilities of a Metabase instance to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks, identify specific weaknesses in the context of Metabase's architecture and configuration, and propose concrete, prioritized mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level insights.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations that the development and operations teams can implement to significantly reduce the risk.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects:

*   **Metabase Authentication Mechanisms:**  We'll examine the default authentication methods provided by Metabase (email/password, SSO, LDAP, JWT), and how they are susceptible to these attacks.
*   **Metabase Configuration Options:** We'll analyze configuration settings (environment variables, application settings) that impact authentication security.
*   **Metabase API Endpoints:** We'll investigate the API endpoints used for authentication and user management, as these are often targets for automated attacks.
*   **Metabase Deployment Environment:**  We'll consider how the deployment environment (e.g., cloud provider, on-premise, containerized) might influence the attack surface and mitigation strategies.  We will *not* cover attacks that bypass Metabase entirely (e.g., direct attacks on the underlying database).
* **Metabase version:** We will assume the latest stable version of Metabase is used. If an older version is in use, this analysis will highlight the need to upgrade as a primary mitigation.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  We'll thoroughly review the official Metabase documentation, including security best practices, configuration guides, and API documentation.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We'll perform a targeted code review of relevant sections of the Metabase codebase (from the provided GitHub repository) focusing on authentication logic, rate limiting, and account lockout mechanisms.  This will *not* be a full code audit, but rather a focused examination of critical areas.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:** We'll research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to Metabase and its dependencies that could be leveraged in brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We'll use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios specific to Metabase.
5.  **Best Practices Analysis:** We'll compare Metabase's default configurations and recommended practices against industry-standard security best practices for authentication.
6.  **Prioritized Recommendations:** We'll provide a prioritized list of mitigation strategies, categorized by impact and effort.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Attack Surface Analysis (Metabase Specifics):**

*   **Default Authentication:** Metabase, by default, uses email/password authentication.  This is the primary target for brute-force and credential stuffing.
*   **API Endpoints:** The `/api/session` endpoint is the critical endpoint for authentication.  Attackers will likely target this endpoint with automated tools.  Other endpoints related to password reset (`/api/user/forgot_password`) and user creation (`/api/user`) could also be abused.
*   **SSO/LDAP/JWT:** If Metabase is configured to use SSO, LDAP, or JWT, the attack surface shifts.  While these *can* be more secure, misconfigurations can still lead to vulnerabilities.  For example, a weak LDAP password policy or a compromised SSO provider could be exploited.  JWT implementations need careful validation of signatures and expiration times.
*   **Setup Token:**  During initial setup, Metabase uses a setup token.  If this token is exposed or not properly invalidated after setup, it could be used to create an administrative account.
*   **Database Credentials:**  Metabase stores its application data in a database (H2 by default, but often PostgreSQL or MySQL in production).  While not directly related to user authentication, weak database credentials could allow an attacker to bypass Metabase's authentication entirely.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis (Code and Configuration):**

*   **Rate Limiting (Code Review):**  Metabase *does* implement rate limiting.  We need to examine the code (specifically in the `metabase.middleware.auth` namespace) to determine:
    *   **Rate Limit Thresholds:**  Are the default thresholds sufficiently low to deter brute-force attacks?  Are they configurable?
    *   **Rate Limit Scope:**  Is rate limiting applied per IP address, per user, or both?  Per-IP limiting can be bypassed by distributed attacks.  Per-user limiting can lock out legitimate users.  A combination is ideal.
    *   **Rate Limit Bypass:**  Are there any known bypasses or weaknesses in the rate limiting implementation?
    *   **Rate Limit Response:**  Does Metabase return a consistent error code (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) when rate limits are exceeded?  This is important for monitoring and alerting.
*   **Account Lockout (Code Review):**  Metabase *does* implement account lockout.  We need to examine the code to determine:
    *   **Lockout Threshold:**  How many failed attempts trigger a lockout?  Is this configurable?
    *   **Lockout Duration:**  How long is an account locked out?  Is this configurable?
    *   **Lockout Reset:**  How can a locked-out account be reset?  Is there a self-service reset mechanism (which could be abused)?  Does it require administrator intervention?
    *   **Lockout Bypass:**  Are there any known bypasses to the lockout mechanism?
*   **Password Policies (Configuration):**  Metabase allows administrators to configure password policies.  We need to assess:
    *   **Minimum Length:**  Is there a configurable minimum password length?  (8 characters is an absolute minimum; 12+ is recommended).
    *   **Complexity Requirements:**  Can administrators require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters?
    *   **Password History:**  Does Metabase prevent password reuse?
    *   **Password Expiration:**  Does Metabase support forced password expiration? (While sometimes debated, it can be a useful defense-in-depth measure).
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA):**  Metabase supports 2FA using Google Authenticator or other TOTP-based apps.  This is a *critical* mitigation.  We need to assess:
    *   **Enforcement:**  Can 2FA be enforced for all users, or is it optional?  Enforcement is strongly recommended.
    *   **Bypass:**  Are there any known bypasses to the 2FA implementation?
    *   **Recovery Codes:**  Does Metabase provide recovery codes in case a user loses their 2FA device?  These codes must be securely stored.
*   **Session Management:**  After successful authentication, Metabase issues a session token.  We need to ensure:
    *   **Token Security:**  Are session tokens sufficiently long and random?  Are they transmitted over HTTPS only?
    *   **Session Timeout:**  Does Metabase enforce session timeouts (both idle and absolute)?
    *   **Session Invalidation:**  Are sessions properly invalidated upon logout or password change?

**2.3. Threat Modeling Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: Basic Brute-Force:** An attacker uses a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite to repeatedly try common usernames and passwords against the `/api/session` endpoint.
*   **Scenario 2: Credential Stuffing:** An attacker uses a list of leaked credentials from another breach and attempts to log in to Metabase, hoping users have reused passwords.
*   **Scenario 3: Distributed Brute-Force:** An attacker uses a botnet to distribute the attack across multiple IP addresses, circumventing per-IP rate limiting.
*   **Scenario 4: Account Lockout DoS:** An attacker intentionally triggers account lockouts for legitimate users, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Scenario 5: SSO/LDAP Compromise:** An attacker compromises the SSO provider or the LDAP server, gaining access to Metabase without needing to brute-force individual accounts.
*   **Scenario 6: Setup Token Leak:** An attacker finds the setup token (e.g., in a publicly accessible log file or environment variable) and uses it to create an administrative account.

**2.4. Detection and Monitoring:**

*   **Log Analysis:** Metabase logs authentication attempts.  These logs should be monitored for:
    *   **High Volume of Failed Logins:**  This is a strong indicator of a brute-force or credential stuffing attack.
    *   **Failed Logins from Unusual IP Addresses:**  This could indicate a distributed attack or a compromised account.
    *   **Account Lockout Events:**  Frequent lockouts could indicate an attack or a problem with password policies.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Metabase logs should be integrated with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):**  An IDS/IPS can be configured to detect and block brute-force attacks based on network traffic patterns.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be used to filter malicious traffic, including brute-force attempts, before it reaches the Metabase server.

### 3. Prioritized Recommendations

The following recommendations are prioritized based on their impact and effort, considering the specifics of Metabase:

| Priority | Recommendation                                     | Impact     | Effort     | Metabase Specifics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High** | **Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**         | **High**   | **Medium** | Use Metabase's built-in 2FA support (Google Authenticator or TOTP).  Make it *mandatory* for all users, especially administrators.  Provide clear instructions and support for users.  Consider using a more robust 2FA solution if available (e.g., Duo, Okta).                                         |
| **High** | **Enforce Strong Password Policies**                | **High**   | **Low**    | Configure Metabase to require strong passwords: minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  Enable password history to prevent reuse.  Consider password expiration (e.g., every 90 days), but balance this with user experience.                                       |
| **High** | **Review and Harden Rate Limiting**                 | **High**   | **Medium** | Examine the `metabase.middleware.auth` code.  Ensure rate limiting is applied per-user *and* per-IP.  Set aggressive thresholds (e.g., 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes).  Ensure a clear HTTP 429 response is returned.  Test for bypasses.                                                              |
| **High** | **Review and Harden Account Lockout**              | **High**   | **Medium** | Examine the `metabase.middleware.auth` code.  Set a reasonable lockout threshold (e.g., 5-10 failed attempts).  Set a reasonable lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes).  Ensure a secure and user-friendly account recovery process is in place.  Test for bypasses.                                     |
| **High** | **Monitor Login Attempts and Logs**                 | **High**   | **Medium** | Integrate Metabase logs with a SIEM system.  Create alerts for high volumes of failed logins, unusual IP addresses, and account lockouts.  Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.                                                                                                              |
| **High** | **Secure Deployment Environment**                   | **High**   | **Medium** | Ensure Metabase is deployed securely: use HTTPS, keep the software up-to-date, use a strong database password, and follow security best practices for the chosen deployment environment (e.g., cloud provider security groups, container security).                                                    |
| **Medium** | **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**       | **Medium** | **Medium** | A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense against brute-force attacks and other web-based threats.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Medium** | **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing** | **Medium** | **High**    | Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Metabase deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Medium** | **Educate Users about Password Security**           | **Medium** | **Low**    | Provide users with training and guidance on creating strong passwords and avoiding phishing scams.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Low**    | **Consider SSO/LDAP (with Careful Configuration)** | **Low**    | **High**    | If appropriate for the organization, consider using SSO or LDAP for authentication.  However, ensure these systems are properly configured and secured.  A misconfigured SSO/LDAP implementation can be *less* secure than well-managed email/password authentication.                             |
| **Low** | **Invalidate Setup Token** | **Low** | **Low** | Ensure that after the initial setup of Metabase, the setup token is properly invalidated to prevent unauthorized access. |
