Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Abuse of Metabase 'Public Sharing' Feature" threat, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis: Abuse of Metabase "Public Sharing" Feature

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Abuse of Metabase 'Public Sharing' Feature" threat, identify its root causes, assess its potential impact, and propose robust, practical mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level suggestions.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team and Metabase administrators.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Public Sharing" feature within Metabase and its potential for misuse, leading to sensitive data exposure.  The scope includes:

*   **Technical Mechanisms:**  How Metabase generates, manages, and revokes public links.  How access control is (or isn't) enforced on these links.
*   **User Behavior:**  Common user errors and misunderstandings that contribute to unintentional data exposure.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Metabase settings and configurations that impact the security of public sharing.
*   **Data Sensitivity:**  Defining what constitutes "sensitive data" within the context of the application using Metabase.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  How an attacker might discover and exploit publicly shared data.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Both technical and procedural controls to prevent or mitigate the threat.
* **Embedding:** How embedding works and how it can be secured.

This analysis *excludes* other Metabase features unrelated to public sharing (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses), unless they directly interact with the public sharing mechanism.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of the relevant sections of the Metabase codebase (specifically, `metabase.public` and related modules) to understand the implementation details of public sharing.  This will be done using the provided GitHub link.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analysis of Metabase's official documentation, including user guides, administrator guides, and security best practices.
*   **Threat Modeling Principles:**  Application of threat modeling principles (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD) to systematically identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
*   **Best Practice Research:**  Review of industry best practices for data sharing, access control, and security awareness training.
*   **Scenario Analysis:**  Development of realistic scenarios to illustrate how the threat could manifest in practice.
*   **Penetration Testing Principles:** Thinking like an attacker to identify potential weaknesses.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Root Causes

The threat stems from a combination of factors:

*   **Lack of Granular Control:**  Metabase's public sharing, in its basic form, provides an "all-or-nothing" approach.  Once a dashboard or question is shared publicly, *anyone* with the link has access.  There's no built-in mechanism to restrict access based on IP address, user agent, or other attributes *without* using embedding and tokens.
*   **User Error (Unintentional Sharing):**  Users may not fully understand the implications of "public" sharing.  They might mistakenly believe it's only accessible to specific individuals or groups, or they might underestimate the sensitivity of the data they are sharing.
*   **Lack of Data Classification:**  Without a clear data classification policy, users may not be able to easily distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive data, leading to accidental exposure of confidential information.
*   **Insufficient Review Processes:**  Organizations may lack formal processes for reviewing and approving requests to share data publicly.  This allows users to bypass security checks and share sensitive data without oversight.
*   **"Convenience over Security" Mindset:**  Public sharing is often perceived as the easiest and fastest way to share data, leading users to prioritize convenience over security.
* **Lack of Link Expiration:** Public links, by default, do not expire. This means a link shared years ago could still be active and exposing data.
* **Predictable Link Structure (Potentially):** If the public link generation algorithm is predictable, an attacker might be able to guess or brute-force valid links.

### 2.2. Attack Vectors

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through several methods:

*   **Link Sharing (Unintentional):**  A legitimate user might inadvertently share the public link on a public forum, social media, or in an email that is later compromised.
*   **Web Scraping/Crawling:**  Attackers can use web crawlers and search engine queries (e.g., Google Dorking) to discover publicly shared Metabase dashboards or questions.  Specific search terms targeting Metabase URLs and common dashboard titles could be used.
*   **Brute-Force/Guessing (If Predictable):**  If the public link structure is predictable (e.g., sequential IDs), an attacker could attempt to guess valid links.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with access to Metabase could intentionally share sensitive data publicly.
*   **Compromised User Account:** If a Metabase user's account is compromised, the attacker could access and share any dashboards or questions the user has created, potentially making them public.
* **Shoulder Surfing/Social Engineering:** An attacker could obtain the public link by observing a legitimate user's screen or by tricking them into revealing the link.

### 2.3. Impact Analysis

The impact of successful exploitation is categorized as **High** due to:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., customer information, financial records, internal business metrics) could lead to a significant data breach.
*   **Regulatory Violations:**  Depending on the nature of the exposed data, the organization could face fines and penalties for violating data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and business opportunities.
*   **Financial Loss:**  The organization may incur significant costs related to incident response, legal fees, and potential lawsuits.
*   **Competitive Disadvantage:**  Exposure of sensitive business data could give competitors an unfair advantage.

### 2.4. Code and Configuration Analysis (Hypothetical - Requires Deeper Dive)

Based on the threat description and general knowledge of web applications, here's a hypothetical analysis of potential code and configuration vulnerabilities.  This needs to be verified with a *real* code review:

*   **`metabase.public` (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Link Generation:**  The code likely generates a unique identifier (UUID, hash, etc.) for each publicly shared dashboard or question.  The security of this mechanism depends on the randomness and collision resistance of the identifier.  A predictable or easily guessable identifier would be a major vulnerability.
    *   **Access Control:**  The code likely checks for the presence of this unique identifier in the URL to grant access.  It *should not* rely on any other form of authentication or authorization for public links (by definition).  The key vulnerability here is the *lack* of additional access control.
    *   **Revocation:**  There should be a mechanism to revoke public links, rendering them inaccessible.  The code needs to ensure that revoked links are properly invalidated and cannot be reactivated.
    *   **Embedding vs. Public Links:** The code likely differentiates between "public links" and "embedding" functionality.  Embedding *should* use a more secure mechanism, such as token-based authentication.

*   **Configuration (Hypothetical):**
    *   **`MB_PUBLIC_SHARING_ENABLED` (or similar):**  A global setting to enable or disable public sharing.  This should be *off* by default.
    *   **`MB_EMBEDDING_TOKEN_SECRET` (or similar):**  A secret key used to generate and validate embedding tokens.  This key must be strong, randomly generated, and securely stored.
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Metabase should log all actions related to public sharing, including link creation, access, and revocation.  This is crucial for detecting and investigating potential abuse.

### 2.5. Enhanced Mitigation Strategies

Building upon the initial mitigations, here are more detailed and robust strategies:

1.  **Disable Public Sharing by Default (and Justify Exceptions):**
    *   **Technical:**  Ensure the `MB_PUBLIC_SHARING_ENABLED` (or equivalent) setting is `false` by default in all new Metabase installations.
    *   **Procedural:**  Require a formal, documented justification and approval process for *any* request to enable public sharing, even temporarily.  This process must include a data sensitivity assessment and sign-off from a designated security authority.

2.  **Mandatory, Multi-Stage Review Process:**
    *   **Stage 1 (Request):**  The user requesting public sharing must provide a clear explanation of the business need, the specific data to be shared, and the intended audience.
    *   **Stage 2 (Data Sensitivity Assessment):**  A data owner or security analyst must review the data and classify its sensitivity level.  If the data is deemed sensitive, public sharing should be *prohibited*.
    *   **Stage 3 (Technical Review):**  A Metabase administrator or security engineer must review the technical implementation of the sharing request, ensuring that it adheres to security best practices.
    *   **Stage 4 (Approval):**  A designated authority (e.g., data protection officer, security manager) must provide final approval before public sharing is enabled.
    *   **Documentation:**  All stages of the review process must be documented and auditable.

3.  **Secure Embedding with Tokenization (and Restrictions):**
    *   **Strong Tokens:**  Use cryptographically secure, randomly generated tokens for embedding.  Avoid predictable or easily guessable tokens.
    *   **Token Rotation:**  Implement a mechanism to automatically rotate embedding tokens on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly).  This limits the impact of a compromised token.
    *   **Token Revocation:**  Provide a way to immediately revoke embedding tokens if they are suspected of being compromised.
    *   **Data Minimization:**  When embedding, expose *only* the specific data required for the embedded application.  Avoid embedding entire dashboards or questions if only a subset of the data is needed.  Use query parameters or filters to restrict the data returned.
    *   **IP Whitelisting (If Possible):** If the embedding application has a known, static IP address, configure Metabase to only allow access to the embedded content from that IP address.
    * **Referrer Restrictions:** Configure Metabase to check the `Referer` header and only allow embedding from authorized domains.

4.  **Automated Audits and Monitoring:**
    *   **Regular Scans:**  Implement automated scripts to regularly scan for all publicly shared dashboards and questions.  These scans should:
        *   Verify that each shared item has a valid, documented justification.
        *   Check for the presence of sensitive data (using pattern matching or data classification tools).
        *   Identify any shared items that have not been accessed recently (potential candidates for revocation).
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of any suspicious activity, such as:
        *   Creation of new public links without proper authorization.
        *   Access to publicly shared data from unexpected IP addresses or user agents.
        *   Detection of sensitive data in publicly shared items.
    *   **Audit Log Review:**  Regularly review Metabase's audit logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activity related to public sharing.

5.  **Comprehensive User Training:**
    *   **Data Privacy Principles:**  Educate users on the importance of data privacy and the risks of unauthorized data disclosure.
    *   **Data Classification:**  Train users on how to identify and classify sensitive data.
    *   **Metabase Security Features:**  Provide detailed training on Metabase's security features, including the risks of public sharing and the proper use of embedding.
    *   **Secure Sharing Practices:**  Teach users secure alternatives to public sharing, such as using internal sharing features or secure file transfer methods.
    *   **Regular Refreshers:**  Conduct regular refresher training to reinforce security awareness and keep users up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices.

6.  **Link Expiration:**
    *   Implement a feature to automatically expire public links after a configurable period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days).  This reduces the window of opportunity for attackers.
    *   Allow users to set shorter expiration times for individual links.

7.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on public link access to prevent brute-force attacks and excessive data scraping.

8. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks that could be used to steal embedding tokens or redirect users to malicious websites.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Abuse of Metabase 'Public Sharing' Feature" poses a significant risk of sensitive data exposure.  By implementing the enhanced mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, organizations can significantly reduce this risk and protect their valuable data.  A combination of technical controls, procedural safeguards, and user education is essential for ensuring the secure use of Metabase.  Regular code reviews, penetration testing, and security audits are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. The most important recommendation is to disable public sharing unless absolutely necessary and to use secure embedding with strong, rotated tokens as the preferred alternative.
