Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the specified SQL Injection threat within the Metabase context.

## Deep Analysis: Exploitation of SQL Injection Vulnerability in a Custom SQL Question (Metabase)

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of the SQL Injection vulnerability within Metabase custom SQL questions, identify the root causes, assess the potential impact, and refine the proposed mitigation strategies to ensure their effectiveness.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to eliminate this vulnerability.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from *user-created custom SQL questions* within Metabase.  It does *not* cover:

*   SQL injection vulnerabilities in Metabase's core code (assuming those have been addressed separately).
*   SQL injection vulnerabilities in the underlying database itself, independent of Metabase.
*   Other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) within Metabase.
*   Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect database permissions (although we *do* consider least privilege as a mitigating factor).

The scope includes:

*   The `metabase.query_processor` and `metabase.driver` components, and related code responsible for handling and executing custom SQL.
*   The process of creating, saving, and executing custom SQL questions with parameters.
*   The interaction between user-provided input and the generated SQL query.
*   The enforcement (or lack thereof) of parameterized queries and input validation.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the relevant Metabase source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how custom SQL questions are processed, how parameters are handled, and where vulnerabilities might exist.  We'll look for instances of string concatenation, insufficient input validation, and improper use of database APIs.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will set up a test Metabase instance and attempt to exploit potential SQL injection vulnerabilities using crafted inputs. This will involve creating custom SQL questions with varying levels of security and attempting to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Threat Modeling Review:** We will revisit the original threat model and refine it based on the findings of the code review and dynamic analysis.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will critically evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies, identify potential weaknesses, and suggest improvements.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will review Metabase's official documentation to understand the intended security mechanisms and identify any gaps between documentation and implementation.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Vulnerability Mechanics (Detailed Explanation):**

The core vulnerability lies in how Metabase *might* handle user-provided parameters within custom SQL questions if not properly configured and used.  Let's break down a vulnerable scenario:

1.  **Vulnerable Question Creation:** A user creates a custom SQL question like this (intentionally simplified for clarity, but demonstrating the vulnerability):

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = {{order_id}} AND customer_id = '{{customer_id}}';
    ```

    The user *intends* `{{order_id}}` and `{{customer_id}}` to be replaced with numeric and string values, respectively.  However, they have *not* explicitly enforced parameterized queries or strict input validation.

2.  **Attacker Input:** An attacker (or even the same user, unknowingly) provides input for the parameters:

    *   `order_id`: `1; DROP TABLE orders; --`
    *   `customer_id`: `' OR 1=1; --`

3.  **Vulnerable Query Construction (String Concatenation):** If Metabase performs simple string substitution *without* proper parameterization, the resulting query sent to the database becomes:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 1; DROP TABLE orders; -- AND customer_id = '' OR 1=1; --';
    ```

4.  **Exploitation:** The database executes the injected commands:

    *   `DROP TABLE orders;`  This is the malicious payload, deleting the `orders` table.
    *   `--`  This comments out the rest of the original query, preventing syntax errors.
    *  `' OR 1=1;` This is classical SQLi, that bypasses customer_id check.

**2.2. Root Causes:**

*   **Lack of Mandatory Parameterization:** Metabase *allows* users to create custom SQL questions without *forcing* the use of parameterized queries (prepared statements). This is the primary root cause.  Even if Metabase *supports* parameterization, if it's optional, users might not use it correctly (or at all).
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Even with parameterization, weak or absent input validation can still allow attackers to bypass intended restrictions.  For example, if a parameter is expected to be an integer, Metabase should *strictly* enforce that it is an integer and reject any non-numeric input.
*   **User Error/Lack of Awareness:** Users may not be aware of the dangers of SQL injection or how to properly use Metabase's security features.  They might inadvertently create vulnerable queries due to a lack of training or understanding.
*   **Overly Permissive Database Permissions:** While not a direct cause of the SQL injection itself, overly permissive database user accounts amplify the impact. If the Metabase database user has `DROP TABLE` privileges, the attack above succeeds.  With least privilege, the damage would be limited.

**2.3. Code Analysis (Illustrative Examples - Not Exhaustive):**

We need to examine the Metabase code to pinpoint the exact locations where these vulnerabilities might occur.  Here are *hypothetical* examples of what we might find (and what to look for):

*   **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical):**

    ```java
    // In metabase.query_processor (or similar)
    String sql = question.getSql(); // Get the user's SQL
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> param : parameters.entrySet()) {
        sql = sql.replace("{{" + param.getKey() + "}}", param.getValue()); // String replacement!
    }
    // ... execute the query ...
    ```

    This is a *classic* example of string concatenation, creating a direct SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **Safer Code (Hypothetical):**

    ```java
    // In metabase.query_processor (or similar)
    String sql = question.getSql();
    PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql); // Use PreparedStatement
    int i = 1;
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> param : parameters.entrySet()) {
        // Validate the parameter type and value here!
        if (isIntegerParameter(param.getKey())) {
            stmt.setInt(i++, Integer.parseInt(param.getValue()));
        } else if (isStringParameter(param.getKey())) {
            stmt.setString(i++, param.getValue());
        } else {
            // Throw an exception or reject the query
        }
    }
    // ... execute the prepared statement ...
    ```

    This example uses a `PreparedStatement`, which is the correct way to handle parameterized queries.  It also includes *hypothetical* input validation (`isIntegerParameter`, `isStringParameter`).

*   **Areas to Scrutinize in Metabase Code:**

    *   Any code that handles `NativeQuery` objects (which represent custom SQL questions).
    *   The `metabase.driver` package and its implementations for different database types.
    *   Code that parses and processes user-provided SQL.
    *   Code that handles parameter substitution or replacement.
    *   Code that interacts with the database API (JDBC, etc.).

**2.4. Dynamic Analysis (Testing Scenarios):**

We would create a series of test cases to validate the vulnerability and the effectiveness of mitigations:

*   **Test Case 1: Basic Injection:**  Attempt the `DROP TABLE` injection described above.
*   **Test Case 2: Data Retrieval:**  Attempt to retrieve data from other tables using `UNION SELECT`.
*   **Test Case 3: Blind SQL Injection:**  Attempt to infer information about the database structure or data using time-based or error-based techniques.
*   **Test Case 4: Parameterized Query Bypass:**  If parameterization is enabled, attempt to bypass it using various techniques (e.g., exploiting type conversion issues, using unexpected characters).
*   **Test Case 5: Input Validation Bypass:**  If input validation is in place, attempt to bypass it by providing unexpected data types, lengths, or formats.
*   **Test Case 6: Second-Order SQL Injection:** Test if stored procedures or triggers are vulnerable.

**2.5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

The proposed mitigation strategies are generally good, but we need to refine them and add details:

*   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Modify the Metabase code to *completely disable* any form of string concatenation or direct substitution of user input into SQL queries.  The `PreparedStatement` (or equivalent for the specific database) *must* be the *only* way to execute custom SQL.
    *   **Enforcement:**  Add server-side checks to reject any custom SQL question that does not use parameterized queries correctly.  This should be a hard stop, not a warning.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Provide clear and informative error messages to users if they attempt to create a vulnerable query.

*   **Strict Input Validation:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement a robust input validation framework that checks *all* user-provided parameters against a whitelist of allowed data types, lengths, and formats.
    *   **Type Enforcement:**  Strictly enforce data types.  If a parameter is expected to be an integer, reject any non-integer input.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of parameters where appropriate (e.g., email addresses, dates).
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good values) rather than a blacklist (block known-bad values).

*   **Mandatory Code Review:**
    *   **Process:**  Establish a formal code review process for *all* custom SQL questions.  This review should be performed by a security-trained individual who is *not* the author of the question.
    *   **Checklist:**  Create a checklist of specific items to look for during the code review, including:
        *   Proper use of parameterized queries.
        *   Strict input validation.
        *   Absence of string concatenation.
        *   Adherence to least privilege principles.
    *   **Automation:**  Explore the possibility of automating some aspects of the code review using static analysis tools.

*   **Least Privilege (Database):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Create dedicated database user accounts for Metabase with the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions.  These accounts should *never* have `DROP`, `CREATE`, or `ALTER` privileges on production databases.
    *   **Granular Permissions:**  Use granular permissions to restrict access to specific tables and columns, if possible.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit database user permissions to ensure they remain consistent with the principle of least privilege.

*   **Comprehensive Training:**
    *   **Curriculum:**  Develop a comprehensive training curriculum that covers:
        *   The dangers of SQL injection.
        *   Secure coding practices for SQL.
        *   The proper use of Metabase's parameterized query features.
        *   The importance of input validation.
        *   The principle of least privilege.
    *   **Hands-on Exercises:**  Include hands-on exercises where users can practice creating secure custom SQL questions and identifying vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep the training materials up-to-date with the latest security best practices and Metabase features.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Implement and configure WAF to filter malicious requests that contain SQL Injection payloads.

**2.6. Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Mandatory Parameterization:** This is the single most important mitigation.  Make it impossible to create custom SQL questions without using parameterized queries correctly.
2.  **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Don't rely solely on parameterization.  Strictly validate all user input.
3.  **Enforce Code Review:**  Make code review a mandatory part of the custom SQL question creation process.
4.  **Apply Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Metabase database users have only the minimum necessary permissions.
5.  **Provide Comprehensive Training:**  Educate users about SQL injection and secure coding practices.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential SQL injection attempts.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Metabase codebase and configuration.
8. **Implement WAF:** Use WAF as additional layer of defence.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the SQL injection threat within Metabase custom SQL questions. By implementing the refined mitigation strategies and following the recommendations, the development team can effectively eliminate this vulnerability and significantly improve the security of the Metabase application.
