## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data and/or Escalate Privileges]]](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_data_andor_escalate_privileges__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. It encompasses gaining unauthorized access to data stored within databases connected to Metabase, and potentially gaining control over the Metabase server or underlying infrastructure.
*   **Likelihood:**  N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete data breach, system compromise, potential lateral movement.)
*   **Effort:** N/A
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [==[Exploit Metabase Vulnerabilities]==](./attack_tree_paths/==_exploit_metabase_vulnerabilities_==.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents attacks that leverage vulnerabilities within the Metabase software itself or its configuration.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Combination of CVEs and common misconfigurations)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Varies (From very low to high, depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (From Script Kiddie to Expert)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (From easy to very hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[CVE Exploitation]]](./attack_tree_paths/__cve_exploitation__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known, unpatched vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Metabase to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on patching frequency; unpatched systems are highly vulnerable.)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, RCE.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits for known CVEs are often publicly available.)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate (Using pre-built exploits is easy; developing new exploits is harder.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (WAFs and intrusion detection systems can help, but sophisticated attackers can evade detection.)
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Patch Management (Critical):** Implement a *strict* and *rapid* patching policy.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to mitigate exploits.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Improper Configuration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__improper_configuration__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the Metabase setup, such as default credentials, exposed interfaces, or overly permissive settings.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common mistakes, especially in less experienced deployments.)
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on the specific misconfiguration; can range from data leaks to full control.)
*   **Effort:** Very Low to Low (Often involves simply checking for default settings or exposed interfaces.)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner (Basic understanding of security principles is enough.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Configuration audits and vulnerability scans can easily detect many misconfigurations.)
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Security Hardening Guide:** Follow Metabase's official security hardening guide *meticulously*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Apply PoLP to *all* aspects of Metabase.
    *   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit the Metabase configuration.
    *   **Strong Passwords and 2FA:** Enforce strong passwords and require 2FA.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Compromise Metabase Authentication/Authorization]](./attack_tree_paths/_compromise_metabase_authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents attacks that focus on bypassing or compromising Metabase's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Brute-force and credential stuffing are very common)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Generally low
*   **Skill Level:** Generally low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [==[[Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing]]==](./attack_tree_paths/==__brute-forcecredential_stuffing__==.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords (brute-force) or use credentials stolen from other breaches (credential stuffing).
*   **Likelihood:** High (Very common attack vector, especially against weak passwords.)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and data.)
*   **Effort:** Very Low to Low (Automated tools are readily available.)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (Basic tools and techniques are widely known.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Rate limiting and account lockout can make detection easier; sophisticated attackers might use distributed attacks.)
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout policies.
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Monitor Login Attempts:** Log and monitor login attempts.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Require 2FA.
