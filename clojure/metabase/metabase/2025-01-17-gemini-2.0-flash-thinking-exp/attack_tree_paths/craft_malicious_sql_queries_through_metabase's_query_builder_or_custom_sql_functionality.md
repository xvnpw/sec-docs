## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Craft Malicious SQL Queries

This attack path leverages Metabase's core functionality of querying data. Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete database compromise.

**4.1 Understanding the Attack Mechanism:**

The core of this attack is **SQL Injection (SQLi)**. Metabase, while providing a user-friendly interface, ultimately translates user actions into SQL queries that are executed against the underlying database. If user input is not properly sanitized and validated before being incorporated into these SQL queries, an attacker can inject their own malicious SQL code.

**4.1.1 Through Metabase's Query Builder:**

While the query builder aims to abstract away direct SQL writing, vulnerabilities can arise if:

* **Filter Values are not Properly Sanitized:**  Attackers might manipulate filter values (e.g., in "where" clauses) to inject SQL. For example, instead of a simple value, they might input: `' OR 1=1 -- ` which could bypass intended filtering.
* **Custom Expressions are Vulnerable:** If Metabase allows users to create custom expressions or calculated fields that are directly translated into SQL without proper sanitization, these can be exploited.
* **Aggregation Functions are Manipulated:**  In some cases, manipulating aggregation functions or their parameters might allow for SQL injection.

**Example Scenario (Query Builder):**

Imagine a filter on a "User ID" field. An attacker might input the following as the filter value:

```sql
1 OR (SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE is_admin = 1) > 0 THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE 0 END) --
```

This attempts a time-based SQL injection. If there's an admin user, the database will pause for 10 seconds, which could be observable.

**4.1.2 Through Metabase's Custom SQL Functionality:**

The custom SQL functionality provides direct access to writing SQL queries. This is inherently more risky as it offers fewer restrictions. Attackers can directly inject any valid SQL code, including:

* **Data Exfiltration:** `SELECT * FROM sensitive_data;`
* **Data Modification:** `UPDATE users SET password = 'hacked' WHERE username = 'admin';`
* **Data Deletion:** `DROP TABLE users;`
* **Privilege Escalation (if database permissions allow):** `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO public;`
* **Information Disclosure:**  Using database-specific functions to reveal system information or configuration details.

**Example Scenario (Custom SQL):**

An attacker with access to the custom SQL editor could directly execute a query like:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users;
```

**4.2 Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

The success of this attack relies on the following potential vulnerabilities:

* **Insufficient Input Validation:** Metabase fails to adequately validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
* **Lack of Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Instead of using parameterized queries where user input is treated as data, Metabase might be directly concatenating user input into the SQL string. This makes SQL injection trivial.
* **Overly Permissive User Permissions:** Users with access to the query builder or custom SQL functionality might have excessive database permissions, allowing them to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
* **Inadequate Security Headers:** Missing or misconfigured security headers might make it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Lack of Output Encoding:** While primarily an issue for XSS, improper output encoding could indirectly aid in understanding the database structure or error messages, assisting in crafting SQL injection attacks.
* **Error Messages Revealing Information:**  Detailed database error messages exposed to the user can provide valuable information to attackers about the database schema and query structure.

**4.3 Potential Impact:**

A successful SQL injection attack through Metabase can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, financial information, and confidential business data.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
* **Service Disruption:**  Attacks that overload the database or cause errors can lead to application downtime and denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher-level accounts or database privileges, allowing further malicious actions.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and significant fines.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of malicious SQL queries in Metabase, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate all user input:**  Enforce data types, lengths, and formats.
    * **Sanitize input:**  Remove or escape potentially malicious characters and SQL keywords.
    * **Use allow-lists instead of block-lists:** Define what is allowed rather than trying to block all possible malicious inputs.
* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
    * **Always use parameterized queries:** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. Ensure that Metabase's internal query generation mechanism utilizes parameterized queries.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Restrict database permissions:** Grant Metabase users only the necessary database privileges required for their specific tasks. Avoid granting broad `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` permissions across all tables.
    * **Control access to custom SQL:**  Limit access to the custom SQL functionality to trusted users who understand the risks involved. Consider requiring a separate approval process for custom SQL queries.
* **Security Headers:**
    * **Implement appropriate security headers:**  `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Referrer-Policy` can help mitigate various attacks, including those that might aid in SQL injection.
* **Output Encoding:**
    * **Encode output:** While primarily for XSS prevention, encoding output can prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts or code injected through SQL.
* **Error Handling:**
    * **Implement robust error handling:**  Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users, as these can reveal valuable information to attackers. Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular security audits:** Review Metabase configurations, user permissions, and query logs for suspicious activity.
    * **Perform penetration testing:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security controls.
* **Keep Metabase Updated:**
    * **Regularly update Metabase:**  Ensure the application is running the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Deploy a WAF:** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the Metabase application.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Implement comprehensive logging:** Log all database queries, user actions, and errors.
    * **Monitor logs for suspicious activity:**  Look for unusual query patterns, failed login attempts, or attempts to access sensitive data.
* **Educate Users:**
    * **Train users on secure coding practices:** If users are allowed to create custom SQL queries, educate them about the risks of SQL injection and how to write secure queries.

**4.5 Conclusion:**

The ability to craft malicious SQL queries through Metabase's query builder or custom SQL functionality represents a significant security risk. By understanding the attack mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities, and impact, the development team can implement appropriate mitigation strategies. Prioritizing the use of parameterized queries, strict input validation, and the principle of least privilege are crucial steps in securing the Metabase application and protecting sensitive data. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and keeping the application updated are also essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
