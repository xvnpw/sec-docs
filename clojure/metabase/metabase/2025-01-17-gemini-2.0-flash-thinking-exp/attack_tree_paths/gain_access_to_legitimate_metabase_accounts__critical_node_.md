### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain access to legitimate Metabase accounts

**Critical Node:** Gain access to legitimate Metabase accounts

**Description:** If successful, the attacker gains access to a valid Metabase user account, allowing them to operate within the application with the permissions of that user.

**Potential Attack Vectors and Sub-Goals:**

To achieve the goal of gaining access to legitimate Metabase accounts, an attacker could employ various methods. These can be categorized as follows:

* **Direct Credential Acquisition:**
    * **Brute-force/Dictionary Attacks:**
        * **Description:**  Attempting to guess usernames and passwords by systematically trying combinations from a predefined list or dictionary.
        * **Likelihood:** Moderate, especially if weak or default passwords are used. Metabase likely has some rate limiting, but sophisticated attacks can bypass basic protections.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful brute-force grants full account access.
    * **Credential Stuffing:**
        * **Description:** Using compromised username/password pairs obtained from breaches of other services. Users often reuse passwords across multiple platforms.
        * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, given the prevalence of data breaches.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful credential stuffing grants full account access.
    * **Phishing:**
        * **Description:** Deceiving users into revealing their credentials through fake login pages or emails impersonating Metabase or related services.
        * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, depending on the sophistication of the phishing campaign and user awareness.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful phishing grants full account access.
    * **Keylogging/Malware:**
        * **Description:** Infecting user devices with malware that captures keystrokes, including login credentials.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the attacker's targeting and the user's security posture.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful keylogging grants full account access and potentially access to other sensitive information.
    * **Social Engineering:**
        * **Description:** Manipulating users into divulging their credentials through deception or trickery (e.g., posing as IT support).
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the attacker's skill and the user's awareness.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful social engineering grants full account access.
    * **Insider Threats:**
        * **Description:** Malicious or negligent actions by individuals with legitimate access to credentials (e.g., disgruntled employees).
        * **Likelihood:** Low, but the impact can be significant.
        * **Impact:** High, as insiders often have privileged access.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Authentication Mechanisms:**
        * **Description:** Leveraging security flaws in Metabase's authentication logic (e.g., SQL injection in login forms, bypass vulnerabilities).
        * **Likelihood:** Low, assuming Metabase follows secure development practices and undergoes regular security testing. However, new vulnerabilities can always be discovered.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful exploitation could grant access to multiple accounts or even administrative privileges.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:**
        * **Description:** Compromising a third-party service or component used by Metabase to gain access to user credentials or the application itself.
        * **Likelihood:** Low, but the impact can be widespread.
        * **Impact:** High, potentially affecting many users.

* **Indirect Credential Acquisition/Bypass:**
    * **Session Hijacking:**
        * **Description:** Stealing a user's active session token to impersonate them without needing their actual credentials. This could be done through XSS vulnerabilities or network sniffing.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the presence of XSS vulnerabilities and network security.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful session hijacking grants temporary access with the user's permissions.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:**
        * **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into Metabase pages that can steal session cookies or redirect users to fake login pages.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the effectiveness of Metabase's input sanitization and output encoding.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful XSS can lead to session hijacking and credential theft.
    * **Account Takeover via Password Reset Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the password reset process to gain control of an account without knowing the original password.
        * **Likelihood:** Low, assuming Metabase has implemented secure password reset mechanisms.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful exploitation grants full account access.
    * **Exploiting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Weaknesses:**
        * **Description:** Bypassing or compromising MFA mechanisms (e.g., SIM swapping, MFA fatigue attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the MFA implementation).
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the type of MFA used and the attacker's sophistication.
        * **Impact:** High, as successful bypass negates the added security of MFA.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

Gaining access to a legitimate Metabase account can have significant consequences, depending on the permissions of the compromised account:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**
    * Access to sensitive data visualized and stored within Metabase dashboards and queries.
    * Potential exposure of business intelligence, financial data, customer information, and other confidential data.
* **Integrity Compromise:**
    * Modification or deletion of dashboards, queries, and data sources, leading to inaccurate reporting and decision-making.
    * Potential for injecting malicious data or manipulating existing data.
* **Availability Disruption:**
    * Deletion or modification of critical dashboards, rendering them unavailable.
    * Potential for locking out legitimate users or disrupting Metabase service.
* **Reputational Damage:**
    * Loss of trust from users and stakeholders due to a security breach.
    * Potential legal and regulatory repercussions depending on the data accessed.
* **Financial Loss:**
    * Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, and potential fines.
    * Loss of business opportunities due to compromised data or service disruption.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strong Password Policies and Enforcement:**
    * Enforce minimum password complexity requirements.
    * Encourage the use of password managers.
    * Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * Mandate MFA for all users, especially those with administrative privileges.
    * Consider using more secure MFA methods like hardware tokens or biometric authentication.
* **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Protection:**
    * Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
    * Consider using CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to differentiate between human and automated login attempts.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities in the authentication process and other areas of the application.
    * Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses.
* **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    * Implement strict input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    * Properly encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Session Management:**
    * Use secure and HTTP-only cookies for session management.
    * Implement session timeouts and invalidation mechanisms.
    * Protect against session fixation and hijacking attacks.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * Educate users about phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and the importance of strong passwords and secure browsing habits.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * Implement comprehensive logging of authentication attempts, failed logins, and other security-related events.
    * Monitor logs for suspicious activity and set up alerts for potential attacks.
* **Password Reset Security:**
    * Implement secure password reset mechanisms that prevent account takeover.
    * Use strong authentication factors for password resets.
* **Regular Software Updates:**
    * Keep Metabase and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * Regularly review and adjust user permissions.
