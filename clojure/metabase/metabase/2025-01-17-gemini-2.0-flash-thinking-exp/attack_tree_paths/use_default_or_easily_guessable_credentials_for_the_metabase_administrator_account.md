### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Use Default or Easily Guessable Credentials for the Metabase Administrator Account

**Attack Tree Path:** Use default or easily guessable credentials for the Metabase administrator account

**Description:** This is a very low-effort attack if default credentials haven't been changed.

#### 4.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Attack

This attack path exploits the common practice of software applications, including Metabase, having default administrator credentials set upon initial installation. If these default credentials are not changed by the administrator, or if a weak and easily guessable password is used, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Metabase instance.

**Steps involved:**

1. **Identification of Target:** The attacker identifies a Metabase instance they wish to compromise. This could be through reconnaissance techniques like port scanning or identifying publicly accessible Metabase instances.
2. **Credential Guessing/Exploitation:** The attacker attempts to log in using known default credentials for Metabase (e.g., username "metabase" or "admin" with a common password like "password", "admin", "123456"). They might also try common password patterns or use credential stuffing techniques if they have access to leaked password databases.
3. **Successful Login:** If the default credentials haven't been changed or a weak password is in use, the attacker successfully authenticates as the administrator.

#### 4.2 Prerequisites for Successful Attack

* **Unchanged Default Credentials:** The most direct path to success is if the administrator has not changed the default username and password provided during the initial setup of Metabase.
* **Weak or Easily Guessable Password:** Even if the default password has been changed, using a weak password (e.g., short, dictionary word, personal information) makes the account vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
* **Accessible Login Page:** The Metabase login page must be accessible to the attacker, either directly over the internet or through an internal network.

#### 4.3 Potential Impact of Successful Attack

Gaining administrator access to a Metabase instance can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data visualized and managed within Metabase. This could include business intelligence, customer data, financial information, and more.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete dashboards, reports, and data sources, leading to inaccurate information and potentially impacting business decisions.
* **System Compromise:** Depending on the Metabase configuration and the underlying system, the attacker might be able to leverage administrator privileges to gain access to the server's operating system or other connected systems.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker can change the administrator password, locking out legitimate users and maintaining persistent access.
* **Malicious Inserts/Updates:** The attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL queries or update data within connected databases if Metabase has write access.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the availability of Metabase by deleting critical configurations or overloading the system.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Metabase.

#### 4.4 Likelihood of Success

The likelihood of this attack succeeding depends heavily on the security practices implemented during the initial setup and ongoing maintenance of the Metabase instance.

* **High Likelihood:** If default credentials are still in use. This is a very common oversight, especially in quick deployments or less security-conscious environments.
* **Medium Likelihood:** If a weak or easily guessable password is used. While better than default credentials, weak passwords are still vulnerable to various attack methods.
* **Low Likelihood:** If strong, unique passwords are enforced and regularly updated.

#### 4.5 Detection Methods

Detecting attempts or successful exploitation of this attack path can be achieved through various methods:

* **Login Attempt Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring of failed login attempts to the Metabase administrator account. A sudden surge of failed attempts from a single IP address could indicate a brute-force attack.
* **Successful Login Auditing:** Log and audit all successful logins to the administrator account, including the source IP address and timestamp. Unusual login times or locations should be investigated.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor user activity after login. Any unusual actions performed by the administrator account, such as creating new users, modifying data sources, or accessing sensitive data in an unexpected way, could indicate a compromised account.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Integrate Metabase logs with a SIEM system to correlate login events with other security events and identify potential attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review user accounts and their permissions, ensuring that only authorized personnel have administrator access and that strong passwords are in use.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies

Preventing this attack is crucial and involves implementing several security best practices:

**Preventative Measures:**

* **Immediately Change Default Credentials:** This is the most critical step. Upon initial installation of Metabase, the administrator should immediately change the default username and password to strong, unique values.
* **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement password complexity requirements (minimum length, use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
* **Force Password Changes on First Login:**  Require users, especially administrators, to change their default password upon their initial login.
* **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes for all users, including administrators.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for the administrator account. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring a second form of verification beyond just the password.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant administrator privileges only to users who absolutely require them. For other users, assign roles with limited permissions.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to temporarily disable an account after a certain number of failed login attempts, hindering brute-force attacks.
* **Secure Password Storage:** Ensure that Metabase stores passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms.

**Detective Measures:**

* **Implement Robust Logging:** Enable comprehensive logging of all login attempts, successful logins, and administrative actions.
* **Set Up Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious login activity, such as multiple failed attempts or successful logins from unusual locations.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to review user accounts, permissions, and password policies.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Metabase instance for known vulnerabilities, including the use of default credentials.

#### 4.7 Development Team Considerations

The development team plays a crucial role in preventing this type of attack:

* **Secure Default Configuration:** Ensure that the default configuration of Metabase prompts or forces users to change default credentials upon initial setup.
* **Clear Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation on how to change default credentials and implement strong password policies.
* **Security Best Practices Guidance:** Include security best practices and recommendations in the installation and configuration guides.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Release regular security updates to address any identified vulnerabilities that could be exploited in conjunction with weak credentials.
* **Consider Removing Default Accounts:** If feasible, consider removing default administrator accounts entirely and requiring the creation of a new administrator account during setup.

#### 4.8 User/Administrator Considerations

Administrators are ultimately responsible for securing their Metabase instances:

* **Prioritize Security:** Understand the importance of changing default credentials and implementing strong password policies.
* **Follow Documentation:** Adhere to the security recommendations provided in the Metabase documentation.
* **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with security best practices and any security advisories related to Metabase.
* **Regularly Review Security Settings:** Periodically review user accounts, permissions, and password policies to ensure they are still appropriate.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Use default or easily guessable credentials for the Metabase administrator account" represents a significant security risk due to its low barrier to entry and potentially high impact. By understanding the mechanics of this attack, its potential consequences, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team and administrators can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and protect sensitive data within the Metabase application. Prioritizing the immediate change of default credentials and the enforcement of strong password policies are the most critical steps in securing the administrator account and the entire Metabase instance.
