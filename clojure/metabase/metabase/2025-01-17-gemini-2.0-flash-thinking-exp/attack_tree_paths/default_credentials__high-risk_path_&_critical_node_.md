### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Default Credentials

**Attack Tree Path:** Default Credentials (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)

**Description:** Metabase, like many applications, may have default administrator credentials that are publicly known or easily guessable.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path exploits the common practice of software vendors providing default usernames and passwords for initial setup or administrative access. While intended for ease of initial configuration, these credentials often remain unchanged, creating a significant security vulnerability.

**Why this is a High-Risk Path and Critical Node:**

* **Ease of Exploitation:**  Exploiting default credentials requires minimal technical skill. Attackers can simply try known default combinations.
* **Publicly Available Information:**  Default credentials for many applications are readily available online through vendor documentation, security advisories, or general internet searches.
* **Wide Applicability:** This vulnerability is not specific to a particular version or configuration of Metabase, making it a broad threat.
* **High Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker full administrative access to the Metabase instance, allowing them to:
    * **Access Sensitive Data:** View, modify, or delete any data accessible through Metabase.
    * **Compromise Connected Databases:** If Metabase has write access to connected databases, attackers could manipulate or exfiltrate data from those sources.
    * **Modify Application Settings:** Change configurations, potentially creating backdoors or disabling security features.
    * **Create New Administrator Accounts:**  Establish persistent access even if the original default credentials are later changed.
    * **Pivot to Other Systems:**  Use the compromised Metabase instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
    * **Cause Denial of Service:**  Disrupt the availability of the Metabase application.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Information Gathering:** An attacker identifies the target organization is using Metabase.
2. **Credential Discovery:** The attacker searches online for "Metabase default credentials" or consults lists of common default credentials.
3. **Login Attempt:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Metabase administration interface using the discovered default credentials.
4. **Successful Authentication:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker gains full administrative access.
5. **Malicious Actions:** The attacker proceeds to perform malicious actions as described in the "High Impact" section above.

**Potential Default Credentials (Examples - Needs Verification for Specific Metabase Version):**

* **Username:** `admin`, `administrator`, `metabase`
* **Password:** `admin`, `password`, `metabase`, `123456` (These are common examples and may not be the actual defaults for Metabase. Thorough investigation is required.)

**Impact Assessment:**

| Impact Area        | Severity | Description                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Critical | Unauthorized access to sensitive data visualized and managed through Metabase. Potential data breaches and exposure of confidential information. |
| **Integrity**      | Critical | Modification or deletion of critical data within Metabase and potentially connected databases, leading to inaccurate reporting and decision-making. |
| **Availability**   | High     | Potential for denial of service by disrupting the Metabase application or its underlying infrastructure.                                  |
| **Compliance**     | High     | Failure to adhere to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) due to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.              |
| **Reputation**     | High     | Damage to the organization's reputation and loss of trust from users and stakeholders due to a security breach.                             |
| **Financial**      | Medium   | Potential financial losses due to data breaches, regulatory fines, and recovery costs.                                                    |

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Force Password Reset on First Login:**  Implement a mechanism that requires users, especially administrators, to change their default passwords immediately upon their first login. This is the most crucial step.
* **Disable Default Accounts:** If possible, disable or remove any pre-configured default administrator accounts after the initial setup is complete.
* **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password policies that require complex passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Regular Password Changes:** Encourage or enforce periodic password changes for all users, especially administrators.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks on login attempts.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including the presence of default credentials.
* **Monitor Login Attempts:** Implement monitoring and alerting for failed login attempts, especially for administrative accounts. This can help detect potential attacks early.
* **Educate Users:**  Educate users, especially administrators, about the importance of strong passwords and the risks associated with using default credentials.
* **Secure Initial Setup Process:**  Ensure the initial setup process for Metabase is secure and guides users to change default credentials immediately.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Monitor for Login Attempts with Default Usernames:**  Set up alerts for login attempts using common default usernames like "admin" or "administrator."
* **Analyze Login Logs:** Regularly review Metabase login logs for suspicious activity, such as successful logins from unusual locations or at unusual times.
* **Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  IDS can help detect malicious activity, including attempts to exploit default credentials.

**Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Adopt a "Security by Default" Mindset:**  Prioritize security from the initial stages of deployment and configuration.
* **Follow Vendor Security Recommendations:**  Adhere to security best practices recommended by Metabase and its underlying technologies.
* **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Metabase to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The "Default Credentials" attack path represents a significant and easily exploitable vulnerability in our Metabase application. The potential impact of a successful attack is severe, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise. It is **critical** that the development team prioritizes the mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly forcing password resets on first login and implementing strong password policies. Regular monitoring and security audits are also essential to ensure the ongoing security of our Metabase instance. Addressing this vulnerability will significantly enhance the security posture of our application and protect sensitive data.
