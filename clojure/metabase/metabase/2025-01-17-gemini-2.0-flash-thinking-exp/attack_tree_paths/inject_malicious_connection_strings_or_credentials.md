### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Connection Strings or Credentials

This attack path focuses on manipulating the way Metabase connects to its data sources. A successful attack could grant the attacker unauthorized access to sensitive data or even allow them to control the Metabase application itself.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

The core of this attack path involves an attacker successfully injecting malicious data into the configuration or storage mechanisms used by Metabase to establish database connections. This can be further broken down into two primary sub-paths:

**4.1. Compromising Stored Credentials:**

* **Description:** This involves gaining access to the credentials used by Metabase to connect to its data sources.
* **Potential Entry Points & Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**
        * **Plaintext storage in configuration files:** If connection strings or credentials are stored in plaintext in configuration files accessible to unauthorized users or processes, they can be easily compromised.
        * **Weak encryption or hashing:** If credentials are encrypted or hashed using weak algorithms, they might be susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
        * **Insufficient file system permissions:** If configuration files containing credentials have overly permissive file system permissions, attackers with access to the server could read them.
    * **Environment Variable Leaks:** If connection details are stored in environment variables and these variables are exposed through vulnerabilities (e.g., server-side request forgery - SSRF), attackers could retrieve them.
    * **Database Compromise:** If the Metabase application's own database is compromised, attackers could potentially access stored connection details if they are stored there.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:**  If Metabase exposes APIs for managing data sources and these APIs have vulnerabilities (e.g., lack of authentication or authorization), attackers could potentially retrieve or modify connection details.
* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Data Access:** The attacker can use the compromised credentials to directly access the connected databases, potentially exfiltrating, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  If the compromised database credentials are used in other systems, the attacker could use them to gain access to those systems as well.
    * **Denial of Service:** The attacker could modify connection details to point to non-existent or overloaded servers, causing denial of service.

**4.2. Injecting Malicious Connection Parameters:**

* **Description:** This involves manipulating the connection parameters used by Metabase to connect to data sources, potentially redirecting connections to attacker-controlled systems.
* **Potential Entry Points & Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Input Validation Flaws in UI/API:**
        * **Lack of sanitization and validation:** If Metabase allows users or APIs to input or modify connection parameters without proper sanitization and validation, attackers could inject malicious parameters. For example, injecting a connection string that points to an attacker's database server.
        * **SQL Injection (Indirect):** While not directly injecting SQL into a query, attackers could inject malicious connection parameters that, when used by Metabase, could lead to unintended SQL execution on the target database (e.g., through database-specific features or vulnerabilities).
    * **Configuration Injection:**
        * **Vulnerabilities in configuration management:** If Metabase's configuration management system is vulnerable, attackers could inject malicious connection parameters into configuration files or databases.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** Similar to credential compromise, vulnerable APIs for managing data sources could allow attackers to modify connection parameters.
* **Impact:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** By redirecting connections to their own database, attackers can intercept and steal data intended for Metabase.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data in their controlled database, potentially leading to incorrect information being displayed in Metabase reports and dashboards, causing confusion or misinformed decisions.
    * **Command Execution (Potentially):** In some database systems, connection parameters can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the database server. If Metabase doesn't properly sanitize these parameters, this could lead to remote code execution on the database server.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** By redirecting connections through their own systems, attackers can intercept and modify data in transit between Metabase and the actual database.

**Common Vulnerabilities Enabling This Attack Path:**

* **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, especially when configuring data sources.
* **Insecure Credential Storage:** Storing sensitive credentials in plaintext or using weak encryption.
* **Lack of Access Control:** Insufficient restrictions on who can view or modify connection configurations.
* **API Vulnerabilities:** Unauthenticated or improperly authorized APIs for managing data sources.
* **Configuration Management Flaws:** Vulnerabilities in how Metabase manages and stores its configuration.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this attack path being exploited depends on the specific security measures implemented in Metabase and the surrounding infrastructure. If Metabase stores credentials securely, rigorously validates input, and implements strong access controls, the likelihood is lower. However, vulnerabilities in any of these areas can significantly increase the risk. The complexity of the attack can vary; compromising stored credentials might be easier if basic security practices are neglected, while injecting malicious connection parameters might require more sophisticated techniques.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful attack through this path can be severe, potentially leading to:

* **Data Breaches:** Exposure of sensitive data from connected databases.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to systems and data beyond the intended scope.
* **Data Manipulation:** Altering data in connected databases, leading to inaccurate information.
* **System Compromise:** In some scenarios, gaining control over the database server or even the Metabase application server.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and damage to the organization's reputation.
* **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with data breaches, recovery efforts, and potential legal repercussions.

**Attacker Motivation:**

Attackers might target this path for various reasons, including:

* **Financial Gain:** Stealing sensitive data for sale or extortion.
* **Espionage:** Gaining access to confidential information for competitive advantage or political purposes.
* **Disruption:** Causing damage or disruption to the organization's operations.
* **Malicious Intent:** Simply wanting to cause harm or demonstrate their capabilities.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risks associated with injecting malicious connection strings or credentials, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Secure Credential Storage:**
    * **Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.**
    * **Utilize secure credential management systems or vaults.**
    * **Encrypt credentials at rest using strong encryption algorithms.**
    * **Implement robust access controls to restrict access to stored credentials.**
* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Thoroughly validate all user inputs related to connection parameters.**
    * **Sanitize input to remove potentially malicious characters or code.**
    * **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities (even indirectly through connection strings).**
    * **Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and formats for connection parameters.**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Grant Metabase only the necessary database permissions required for its functionality.**
    * **Restrict access to configuration files and sensitive data to authorized personnel and processes.**
* **Secure API Design and Implementation:**
    * **Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all APIs related to data source management.**
    * **Follow secure coding practices to prevent API vulnerabilities.**
    * **Rate-limit API requests to prevent brute-force attacks.**
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular security audits of the Metabase application and its configuration.**
    * **Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.**
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * **Educate developers and administrators about the risks associated with insecure credential storage and input validation.**
    * **Promote secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.**
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Implement comprehensive logging of connection attempts and configuration changes.**
    * **Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unexpected changes to connection parameters.**
    * **Set up alerts for potential security incidents.**
* **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    * **Keep Metabase and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.**
    * **Monitor security advisories and promptly address any identified vulnerabilities.**
* **Consider using connection pooling with restricted permissions:** This can limit the impact of compromised credentials by controlling the scope of access for each connection.
