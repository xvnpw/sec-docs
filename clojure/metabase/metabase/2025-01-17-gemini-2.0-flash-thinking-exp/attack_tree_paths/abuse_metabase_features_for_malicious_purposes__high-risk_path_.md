### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Abuse Metabase Features for Malicious Purposes

**Attack Tree Path:** Abuse Metabase Features for Malicious Purposes (High-Risk Path)

**Description:** Attackers leverage the intended functionality of Metabase in unintended and harmful ways.

This high-level path encompasses a range of potential attacks. Here's a breakdown of specific scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Malicious Query Execution & Data Exfiltration**

* **Feature Abused:** Query builder (SQL, native queries, GUI builder)
* **Attack Description:** An attacker, either with legitimate access or through a compromised account, crafts and executes malicious queries to extract sensitive data from connected databases. This could involve:
    * **Direct Data Exfiltration:**  Using `SELECT` statements to retrieve large amounts of sensitive data.
    * **Union-Based Attacks:**  Combining results from different tables to access unauthorized information.
    * **Blind SQL Injection (if underlying database is vulnerable):**  While Metabase aims to prevent direct SQL injection into its own application, poorly configured or vulnerable connected databases could be exploited through Metabase's query interface.
* **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidential information, potential regulatory fines.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate to High (depending on user access controls and database security).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to access specific data sources and tables.
    * **Query Review and Auditing:** Implement mechanisms to review and audit executed queries for suspicious activity.
    * **Data Masking and Redaction:**  Mask or redact sensitive data within Metabase where appropriate.
    * **Secure Database Configuration:**  Ensure connected databases are securely configured to prevent SQL injection and unauthorized access.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization (at the database level):**  While Metabase provides some abstraction, robust input validation on the database side is crucial.
    * **Connection String Security:** Securely manage and store database connection credentials.

**Scenario 2: Dashboard Manipulation for Misinformation or Phishing**

* **Feature Abused:** Dashboard creation and sharing
* **Attack Description:** An attacker manipulates dashboards to display misleading information, potentially causing confusion, financial loss, or reputational damage. They could also embed malicious links or content within dashboard elements, leading to phishing attacks.
* **Impact:** Misinformation, reputational damage, potential financial loss for users relying on the data, successful phishing attacks.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate (depends on dashboard sharing settings and user awareness).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Dashboard Access Controls:**  Restrict who can create, edit, and share dashboards.
    * **Content Review:** Implement a review process for critical dashboards before they are widely shared.
    * **User Training:** Educate users about the potential for manipulated dashboards and how to identify suspicious content.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which dashboard elements can load content, mitigating the risk of embedded malicious scripts.
    * **Watermarking:** Consider watermarking sensitive dashboards to indicate their origin and authenticity.

**Scenario 3: Abuse of Pulse Functionality for Information Gathering or DoS**

* **Feature Abused:** Pulse creation and scheduling
* **Attack Description:** An attacker could create and schedule numerous resource-intensive pulses to overload the Metabase server or connected databases, leading to a denial-of-service. They could also use pulses to repeatedly query for specific information, potentially revealing sensitive data over time through subtle changes in results.
* **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, potential information disclosure through repeated queries.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate (especially if user permissions are not properly managed).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Pulse Quotas and Rate Limiting:** Implement limits on the number of pulses a user can create and the frequency at which they can run.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Metabase server and database resource utilization to detect unusual activity.
    * **Pulse Review and Approval:**  For critical or potentially resource-intensive pulses, implement a review and approval process.
    * **User Activity Monitoring:**  Monitor user activity related to pulse creation and scheduling.

**Scenario 4: Privilege Escalation through User/Group Management Abuse**

* **Feature Abused:** User and group management
* **Attack Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges could modify user roles or group memberships to gain access to more sensitive data or functionalities than they are authorized for. This could involve adding themselves to administrator groups or granting themselves access to restricted data sources.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform administrative actions, potential for further malicious activity.
* **Likelihood:** Low (requires existing elevated privileges or a vulnerability in the user management system).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Access Control Policies:**  Implement and enforce strict access control policies for user and group management.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all users, especially administrators, to prevent unauthorized account access.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review user roles and group memberships to ensure they are appropriate.
    * **Audit Logging:**  Maintain detailed audit logs of all user and group management activities.

**Scenario 5: Exploiting Embedding Functionality for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Data Theft**

* **Feature Abused:** Embedding functionality
* **Attack Description:** If embedding is enabled, an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into embedded Metabase dashboards or visualizations on external websites. This could lead to XSS attacks, allowing them to steal user credentials or perform actions on behalf of users visiting the compromised website. Alternatively, if embedding is not properly secured, sensitive data could be exposed on unintended external sites.
* **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities, data breaches, reputational damage to both the Metabase instance and the embedding website.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate (depends on the security of the embedding implementation and the target website).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Embedding Implementation:**  Follow best practices for secure embedding, including proper authentication and authorization.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP headers on the embedding website to mitigate XSS risks.
    * **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**  Ensure that data displayed in embedded content is properly sanitized and encoded to prevent script injection.
    * **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the embedding implementation.

**Scenario 6: API Abuse for Automation of Malicious Activities**

* **Feature Abused:** API access
* **Attack Description:** An attacker could leverage the Metabase API to automate malicious activities, such as repeatedly executing queries, creating malicious dashboards, or manipulating user accounts. This can amplify the impact of other attacks and make them more difficult to detect.
* **Impact:** Scaled attacks, faster execution of malicious activities, potential for service disruption.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate (if API access is not properly secured and authenticated).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **API Key Management:**  Securely manage and rotate API keys.
    * **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
    * **Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all API requests.
    * **API Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor API usage for suspicious patterns and anomalies.
