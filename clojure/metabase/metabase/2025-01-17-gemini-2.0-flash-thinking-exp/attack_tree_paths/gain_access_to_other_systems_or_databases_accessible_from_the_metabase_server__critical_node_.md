### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Access to Other Systems or Databases Accessible from the Metabase Server

**Attack Path:** Gain access to other systems or databases accessible from the Metabase server (Critical Node) -> By compromising the data source connection, attackers can pivot from the Metabase server to other connected systems, potentially expanding their access within the application's infrastructure.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Initial Compromise of Metabase Server (Prerequisite):**  Before an attacker can compromise a data source connection, they typically need to gain some level of access to the Metabase server itself. This could be achieved through various means (though outside the primary scope of this analysis, it's important to acknowledge):
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Metabase application.
    * Gaining access through compromised user credentials.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or infrastructure.

2. **Targeting Data Source Connection Information:** Once inside the Metabase server, the attacker's next step is to locate and extract the configuration details for the data source connections. This information is crucial for pivoting to other systems. Potential locations for this information include:
    * **Metabase Application Database:** Connection details (credentials, connection strings) might be stored within Metabase's internal database. If this database is compromised, connection information is readily available.
    * **Configuration Files:**  Metabase might store connection details in configuration files on the server.
    * **Environment Variables:** Connection strings or credentials could be stored as environment variables accessible to the Metabase process.
    * **Memory:** In some scenarios, connection details might be temporarily present in the memory of the running Metabase process.
    * **Secrets Management Systems (if used):** If Metabase integrates with a secrets management system, the attacker might attempt to access these secrets.

3. **Exploiting the Data Source Connection:** With the connection details in hand, the attacker can then attempt to use these credentials to access the connected systems or databases. This could involve:
    * **Direct Connection:** Using the extracted credentials to establish a direct connection to the target database or system from the compromised Metabase server.
    * **SQL Injection (if applicable):** If Metabase uses the compromised connection to execute queries, the attacker might be able to inject malicious SQL code to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data on the target database. This is particularly relevant if the data source is a relational database.
    * **Leveraging Trust Relationships:** If the Metabase server has established trust relationships with other systems (e.g., through network configurations or shared credentials), the attacker can leverage this trust to move laterally.

4. **Lateral Movement and Further Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation of the data source connection allows the attacker to pivot to the connected system. From there, they can:
    * **Access Sensitive Data:**  Retrieve sensitive information stored in the connected database or system.
    * **Modify Data:**  Alter or delete data within the connected system.
    * **Compromise the Connected System:**  Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the connected system itself, potentially gaining further access within the infrastructure.
    * **Use the Connected System as a Pivot Point:**  Utilize the newly compromised system to access even more systems within the network.

**Potential Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses:**

* **Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials:**
    * Storing credentials in plaintext within the Metabase application database or configuration files.
    * Using weak or easily guessable credentials for data source connections.
    * Lack of proper encryption for stored credentials.
* **Insufficient Access Controls:**
    * Overly permissive access controls on the Metabase server, allowing unauthorized users or processes to access sensitive configuration files or the application database.
    * Lack of proper segregation of duties, allowing the same account to manage both Metabase and data source connections.
* **Vulnerabilities in Metabase Application:**
    * Exploitable vulnerabilities within the Metabase application itself that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms and access connection details.
    * Lack of proper input validation, potentially leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities when interacting with data sources.
* **Insecure Network Configuration:**
    * Lack of network segmentation, allowing the compromised Metabase server to directly communicate with sensitive internal systems without proper restrictions.
    * Use of insecure protocols for data source connections (e.g., unencrypted connections).
* **Lack of Monitoring and Logging:**
    * Insufficient logging of data source connection attempts and activities, making it difficult to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.
    * Lack of alerting mechanisms for unusual data access patterns.
* **Outdated Software:**
    * Running outdated versions of Metabase or the underlying operating system, which may contain known security vulnerabilities.

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in the connected databases or systems.
* **System Compromise:**  Full compromise of the connected systems, allowing attackers to control them.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and damage to the organization's reputation due to the security breach.
* **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal fees, and potential fines.
* **Business Disruption:**  Interruption of critical business processes due to system unavailability or data corruption.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure Storage of Data Source Credentials:**
    * **Encryption:** Encrypt data source credentials at rest using strong encryption algorithms. Metabase supports using environment variables or a secrets manager for sensitive information.
    * **Secrets Management:** Integrate Metabase with a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage data source credentials.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to the Metabase application for accessing data sources. Use dedicated service accounts with restricted privileges.
* ** 강화된 접근 제어 ( 강화된 접근 제어 ):**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement robust RBAC within Metabase to control who can create, modify, and view data source connections.
    * **Operating System Level Security:** Secure the underlying operating system and file system to restrict access to Metabase configuration files and the application database.
* **Metabase Security Hardening:**
    * **Keep Metabase Updated:** Regularly update Metabase to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Configuration:** Follow Metabase's security best practices for configuration, including disabling unnecessary features and setting strong passwords.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities when querying data sources.
* **Network Security:**
    * **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the Metabase server and restrict its access to only necessary internal systems.
    * **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewalls to allow only necessary network traffic to and from the Metabase server.
    * **Secure Protocols:** Enforce the use of secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for all data source connections.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Comprehensive Logging:** Enable detailed logging of all data source connection attempts, queries, and modifications.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Metabase logs with a SIEM system to detect and alert on suspicious activity.
