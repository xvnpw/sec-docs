**4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Abuse Metabase's Data Source Connection Features**

**Attack Tree Path:** Abuse Metabase's Data Source Connection Features (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the way Metabase connects to data sources to gain unauthorized access.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

This high-risk path centers around exploiting vulnerabilities in how Metabase manages and utilizes data source connection information. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors within this path:

* **4.1. Exploiting Insufficient Input Validation during Data Source Creation/Modification:**
    * **Description:** When a user (with appropriate permissions) adds or modifies a data source connection, Metabase might not adequately sanitize or validate the input provided for connection parameters (e.g., hostname, username, password, database name, connection strings).
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **SQL Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into connection parameters, which could be executed by Metabase against the target database. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
        * **OS Command Injection:**  In certain database types or connection methods, it might be possible to inject operating system commands within connection strings or other parameters.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By manipulating the hostname or other network-related parameters, an attacker could potentially force Metabase to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or compromising other systems.
    * **Potential Impact:** Complete compromise of the connected database, data breaches, denial of service, and potential compromise of internal network resources.

* **4.2. Leveraging Stored Credentials Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Metabase needs to store credentials to connect to data sources. If these credentials are not stored securely, an attacker could potentially retrieve them.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Plaintext Storage:**  Storing credentials in plaintext is a critical vulnerability.
        * **Weak Encryption:** Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms to protect stored credentials.
        * **Insufficient Access Controls:**  If the storage mechanism for credentials is not properly secured, an attacker with access to the Metabase server or database could potentially retrieve them.
        * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** While not directly related to Metabase's storage, if default or weak credentials are used for data sources, attackers could attempt to guess or brute-force them.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Direct access to connected databases, allowing attackers to perform any actions authorized by the compromised credentials.

* **4.3. Abusing Data Source Permissions and Access Controls:**
    * **Description:**  If Metabase's permission model for managing data sources is not robust, attackers could potentially gain access to connections they shouldn't have.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges within Metabase, allowing access to manage data sources.
        * **Broken Access Control:**  Circumventing intended access restrictions to view, modify, or utilize data source connections belonging to other users or groups.
        * **Default or Weak Permissions:**  Overly permissive default settings for data source access.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify or delete data sources, and potential for further lateral movement within the connected databases.

* **4.4. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Database Drivers or Connection Libraries:**
    * **Description:** Metabase relies on external libraries and drivers to connect to various database types. Vulnerabilities in these components could be exploited.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Known Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific database drivers used by Metabase.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  If connections to database servers are not properly secured (e.g., using TLS), attackers could intercept credentials or data in transit.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution on the Metabase server or the database server.

* **4.5. Misconfiguration of Data Source Connections:**
    * **Description:**  Incorrectly configured data source connections can introduce security risks.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Using overly permissive database user accounts:** Connecting with accounts that have excessive privileges on the target database.
        * **Exposing sensitive connection details in logs or error messages:**  Accidentally revealing credentials or connection strings.
        * **Leaving default credentials unchanged:**  Using default usernames and passwords for database connections.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Increased attack surface and potential for unauthorized access if the database itself is compromised.

**Potential Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

A successful attack exploiting Metabase's data source connection features can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in connected databases.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to business disruption or financial loss.
* **System Compromise:**  Potential for gaining control over the Metabase server or even the connected database servers.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from users and customers due to security incidents.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to meet regulatory requirements for data security.

**5. Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risks associated with this attack path, the following strategies are recommended:

* **5.1. Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Implement strict input validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input provided during data source creation and modification, including connection parameters.
    * **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:**  Prevent SQL injection by ensuring user-supplied data is treated as data, not executable code.
    * **Sanitize input:**  Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from input fields.
    * **Implement whitelisting:**  Define allowed characters and formats for connection parameters.

* **5.2. Secure Credential Storage:**
    * **Never store credentials in plaintext:**  This is a fundamental security principle.
    * **Use strong encryption algorithms:**  Employ industry-standard encryption methods to protect stored credentials.
    * **Utilize a dedicated secrets management system:**  Consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage database credentials.
    * **Implement proper access controls for credential storage:**  Restrict access to the storage mechanism to only authorized personnel and processes.

* **5.3. Enforce Strong Data Source Permissions and Access Controls:**
    * **Implement a granular permission model:**  Allow administrators to define specific permissions for accessing and managing data sources.
    * **Follow the principle of least privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * **Regularly review and audit data source permissions:**  Ensure that access controls are still appropriate and that no unauthorized access exists.

* **5.4. Keep Database Drivers and Connection Libraries Up-to-Date:**
    * **Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies:**  Stay informed about security updates for database drivers and connection libraries.
    * **Automate dependency updates where possible:**  Use tools to help manage and update dependencies efficiently.
    * **Monitor for vulnerabilities in used libraries:**  Utilize security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.

* **5.5. Secure Database Connections:**
    * **Enforce TLS/SSL for all database connections:**  Encrypt communication between Metabase and the database servers to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Verify server certificates:**  Ensure that Metabase verifies the authenticity of the database server's certificate.

* **5.6. Implement Secure Configuration Practices:**
    * **Avoid using overly permissive database user accounts:**  Create dedicated user accounts with the minimum necessary privileges for Metabase to function.
    * **Securely manage and rotate database credentials:**  Regularly change database passwords.
    * **Avoid exposing sensitive connection details in logs or error messages:**  Implement proper logging and error handling to prevent accidental disclosure of credentials.

* **5.7. Security Auditing and Monitoring:**
