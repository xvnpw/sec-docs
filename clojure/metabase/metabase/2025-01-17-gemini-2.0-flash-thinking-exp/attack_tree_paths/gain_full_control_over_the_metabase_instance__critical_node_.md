### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Successfully Logging in with Default Credentials

**Attack Tree Node:** Successfully logging in with default credentials grants the attacker complete administrative control over Metabase, allowing them to manipulate data, configurations, and potentially access connected databases.

**Description:**

This attack path hinges on the existence and continued use of default credentials within the Metabase application. Default credentials are usernames and passwords that are pre-configured by the software vendor or during the initial setup process. If these credentials are not changed by the administrator, they become a significant security vulnerability.

In the context of Metabase, successful login with default credentials typically grants the attacker administrative privileges. This level of access provides extensive control over the application and its environment.

**Technical Details:**

* **Existence of Default Credentials:**  While Metabase itself doesn't ship with widely known, hardcoded default credentials in recent versions, the possibility exists in several scenarios:
    * **Older Versions:** Older versions of Metabase might have had default credentials that are now publicly known.
    * **Deployment Errors:** During the initial setup or deployment process, administrators might inadvertently set weak or easily guessable passwords, effectively creating "default" credentials.
    * **Container Images/Deployments:**  If Metabase is deployed using pre-built container images or deployment scripts, these might contain default credentials if not properly secured.
    * **Internal Documentation/Leaks:**  Default credentials might be documented internally and could be leaked or discovered by malicious actors.

* **Login Process:**  The attacker would attempt to access the Metabase login page (typically `/auth/login` or similar). They would then try common default usernames (e.g., `admin`, `administrator`, `metabase`) and associated default or weak passwords (e.g., `password`, `123456`, the username itself).

* **Administrative Control:** Upon successful login with administrative credentials, the attacker gains access to the Metabase administrative interface. This typically allows them to:
    * **Manage Users and Permissions:** Create new administrative accounts, elevate privileges of existing accounts, and disable legitimate users.
    * **Configure Data Sources:** Access and modify connection details for connected databases, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in those databases.
    * **Create and Modify Questions and Dashboards:**  Manipulate data visualizations and reports, potentially spreading misinformation or hiding malicious activity.
    * **Access Application Logs:** Review logs for sensitive information or to cover their tracks.
    * **Modify Application Settings:** Change critical configurations, potentially disabling security features or creating backdoors.
    * **Execute Code (Potentially):** Depending on the Metabase version and configuration, there might be ways to execute arbitrary code through features like custom SQL queries or by manipulating application settings.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successfully exploiting default credentials in Metabase is **critical** due to the complete administrative control gained:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Access to sensitive data within Metabase and potentially connected databases. This could include business intelligence, customer data, financial information, etc.
* **Integrity Compromise:**  Manipulation of data within Metabase and potentially connected databases. This could lead to incorrect reporting, flawed decision-making, and reputational damage.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Disabling the Metabase instance, preventing legitimate users from accessing critical data and reports.
* **Financial Loss:**  Due to data breaches, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and business disruption.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if sensitive data is compromised.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this attack path being successful depends on the security practices implemented during the initial setup and ongoing maintenance of the Metabase instance:

* **High:** If default credentials were not changed during setup or if weak passwords were used.
* **Medium:** If the organization relies on standard deployment procedures without specific checks for default credentials.
* **Low:** If strong password policies are enforced during setup and regular security audits are conducted.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack, the following mitigation strategies are crucial:

* **Force Password Change on First Login:**  Metabase should enforce a password change for the initial administrative account upon the first login.
* **Strong Password Policy:** Implement and enforce a strong password policy requiring complex passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Regular Password Updates:** Encourage or enforce periodic password changes for all administrative accounts.
* **Account Monitoring and Auditing:** Implement logging and monitoring of login attempts, especially for administrative accounts. Alert on suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting unnecessary administrative privileges. Create specific roles with limited permissions for regular users.
* **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Ensure that deployment scripts and container images do not contain default or weak credentials.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including the presence of default or weak credentials.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate administrators and users about the risks associated with default credentials and the importance of strong password practices.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.

**Detection and Response:**

If an attacker attempts to exploit default credentials, the following detection and response mechanisms can be employed:

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor Metabase application logs for successful login attempts from unexpected locations or after multiple failed attempts with common default usernames.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Configure IDS/IPS to detect and alert on suspicious login activity targeting the Metabase instance.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Metabase logs with a SIEM system to correlate login events with other security data and identify potential attacks.
* **Alerting Systems:** Configure alerts to notify security personnel of suspicious login activity, especially for administrative accounts.
* **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a well-defined incident response plan to handle a successful breach, including steps for containing the damage, investigating the incident, and recovering compromised data.

**Tools and Techniques for Attackers:**

Attackers might use the following tools and techniques to exploit default credentials:

* **Brute-force tools:** Tools like Hydra or Medusa can be used to try common default usernames and passwords.
* **Credential stuffing:**  Using lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords to attempt login.
* **Manual attempts:**  Trying common default credentials based on knowledge of the application.

**Real-World Examples (General):**

While specific instances of Metabase being compromised due to default credentials might not be widely publicized, the exploitation of default credentials is a common attack vector across various applications and systems. Many high-profile breaches have originated from the failure to change default passwords on devices and software.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path of gaining full control over Metabase through default credentials represents a significant and easily exploitable vulnerability. While Metabase itself might not have widely known hardcoded defaults in recent versions, the risk stems from potential oversights during setup, weak password choices, or insecure deployment practices. Implementing strong password policies, enforcing password changes, and regularly auditing security configurations are crucial steps to mitigate this risk and protect the Metabase instance and its valuable data. Proactive detection and a robust incident response plan are also essential for minimizing the impact of a successful attack.
