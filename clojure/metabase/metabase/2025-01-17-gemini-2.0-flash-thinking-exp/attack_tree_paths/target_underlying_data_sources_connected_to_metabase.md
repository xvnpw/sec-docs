### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Targeting Underlying Data Sources Connected to Metabase

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **Goal:** Target underlying data sources connected to Metabase
    * **Method:** The malicious queries are aimed at the databases that Metabase is connected to.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

This attack path focuses on leveraging Metabase as a conduit to execute malicious queries against the connected databases. The attacker's objective is to bypass direct database security controls by exploiting Metabase's access and query execution capabilities.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

Several potential attack vectors could be used to achieve this goal:

* **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    * **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Metabase's query building or execution logic where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being incorporated into SQL queries sent to the database.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could craft malicious input through Metabase's UI (e.g., in filters, custom questions, or dashboard parameters) or via API calls that, when processed by Metabase, results in the execution of unintended SQL commands on the underlying database.
    * **Example:** Injecting SQL code into a filter field to bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive data from tables Metabase is not intended to access.
* **API Abuse:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting Metabase's API endpoints to directly execute malicious queries.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities in the API authentication, authorization, or input validation to send crafted API requests that execute arbitrary SQL queries on the connected databases. This could involve exploiting insecure API endpoints or bypassing access controls.
    * **Example:** Using the Metabase API to create or modify questions with malicious SQL code or directly executing queries through an exposed endpoint.
* **Compromised User Credentials:**
    * **Description:** Gaining access to a legitimate Metabase user account with sufficient privileges to create and execute queries.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could obtain valid credentials through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Once logged in, they can use Metabase's built-in query tools to directly craft and execute malicious queries.
    * **Example:** Using a compromised administrator account to execute `DROP TABLE` commands or extract sensitive data.
* **Exploiting Metabase's Query Builder Features:**
    * **Description:**  Misusing or exploiting features within Metabase's query builder that allow for complex or custom queries.
    * **Mechanism:**  An attacker might leverage features like custom expressions, native queries, or the ability to join data from multiple sources to construct queries that bypass intended security restrictions or expose sensitive information.
    * **Example:** Crafting a custom expression that performs a UNION ALL operation to retrieve data from unauthorized tables.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Indirectly):**
    * **Description:** While not directly executing malicious queries, an attacker could potentially leverage SSRF vulnerabilities in Metabase (if present) to indirectly interact with the database server in unintended ways.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could manipulate Metabase to make requests to internal resources, potentially including the database server, although this is less direct for executing arbitrary queries.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful attack following this path can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Exfiltration of sensitive data from the underlying databases, leading to privacy violations, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to business disruption, inaccurate reporting, and potential legal liabilities.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Executing resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, making it unavailable for legitimate users and applications.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher levels of access within the database if the compromised Metabase connection has elevated privileges.
* **Compliance Violations:** Breaching regulatory requirements related to data security and privacy (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

**Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**

To mitigate the risks associated with this attack path, the following measures are recommended:

**For Metabase Application:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data that is used in query construction. This includes escaping special characters and validating data types and formats.
* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever interacting with the database. This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data rather than executable code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure Metabase's database connections with the minimum necessary privileges required for its intended functionality. Avoid granting overly permissive access.
* **Secure API Design and Implementation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Metabase's API endpoints. Carefully validate all API requests and responses.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in Metabase's code and configuration.
* **Keep Metabase Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Metabase to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.
* **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of all database interactions and API requests. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

**For Underlying Data Sources:**

* **Database Firewall:** Implement a database firewall to restrict access to the database server from unauthorized sources.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the database server on a separate network segment with restricted access.
* **Regular Security Audits of Database Configurations:** Ensure the database is configured securely, with strong authentication, authorization, and access controls.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Level):** Grant Metabase's database user only the necessary permissions for its intended operations. Avoid granting `SELECT *` or broad update/delete permissions.
* **Data Masking and Encryption:** Implement data masking or encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** Implement DAM solutions to monitor database activity for suspicious queries and access patterns.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path targeting underlying data sources through malicious queries in Metabase poses a significant risk. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks. A layered security approach, encompassing both the Metabase application and the underlying data sources, is crucial for protecting sensitive data. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
