### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection via Metabase Queries (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)

**Attack Vector:** Crafting and executing malicious SQL queries through Metabase's interface.

**Entry Points:**

* **Metabase Query Builder:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Attackers can manipulate input fields within the visual query builder to inject malicious SQL fragments. This often involves exploiting insufficient sanitization or escaping of user-provided data that is incorporated into the generated SQL queries.
    * **Example Scenario:**  Imagine a filter on a "User ID" field. An attacker might input a value like `1 OR 1=1 --` which, if not properly handled, could bypass the intended filter and return all user data. More sophisticated injections could involve `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from other tables or even execute stored procedures.
    * **Vulnerability:**  The core vulnerability lies in the lack of robust input validation and sanitization within the query builder's logic. If Metabase directly incorporates user input into SQL queries without proper escaping or using parameterized queries, it becomes susceptible to injection.

* **Manipulating Custom SQL Queries:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Metabase allows users to write and execute custom SQL queries against the connected databases. This provides a direct pathway for attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    * **Example Scenario:** An attacker with access to the custom SQL query interface could directly write malicious queries like `DROP TABLE users;` or `SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE username = 'admin' UNION SELECT credit_card FROM payment_details;`.
    * **Vulnerability:**  The inherent risk here stems from the trust placed in users with the ability to write custom SQL. While this functionality is powerful, it requires strict access controls and potentially additional security measures to prevent abuse. Insufficient input validation within the custom query execution engine can also exacerbate the risk.

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Attacker Identification:** An attacker identifies Metabase as the target application and recognizes the potential for SQL injection through its query functionalities.
2. **Access Acquisition:** The attacker needs access to the Metabase interface. This could be through legitimate user credentials (compromised or insider threat) or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
3. **Query Crafting:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries tailored to exploit potential weaknesses in how Metabase handles user input within its query builder or custom SQL execution.
4. **Injection and Execution:** The attacker injects the malicious SQL query through the chosen entry point (query builder or custom SQL). Metabase, if vulnerable, will execute this query against the connected database.
5. **Database Interaction:** The malicious SQL query interacts directly with the connected database, potentially leading to:
    * **Data Breach:**  Retrieving sensitive information from the database.
    * **Data Modification:**  Altering or deleting data within the database.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  Using SQL commands to grant themselves higher privileges within the database.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Executing resource-intensive queries to overload the database.
    * **Code Execution (in some database systems):**  Potentially executing operating system commands through database functionalities like `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server (if enabled).

**Potential Impacts (High-Risk & Critical Node Justification):**

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data stored in the connected databases, leading to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.
* **Integrity Violation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to business disruption, inaccurate reporting, and potential financial losses.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Database downtime due to DoS attacks or data corruption, impacting the availability of the Metabase application and any dependent services.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
* **Lateral Movement:**  In some scenarios, successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further attacks, potentially allowing attackers to gain access to other systems connected to the compromised database server.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer confidence.

**Technical Details and Considerations:**

* **Lack of Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  If Metabase constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user input, it is highly vulnerable. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code, effectively preventing SQL injection.
* **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Failing to properly validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries is a primary cause of SQL injection vulnerabilities. This includes escaping special characters and ensuring data conforms to expected formats.
* **Database User Permissions:**  If the database user Metabase uses has excessive privileges, the impact of a successful SQL injection attack is amplified. Following the principle of least privilege is crucial.
* **Error Handling:**  Verbose error messages from the database can sometimes reveal information about the database schema and structure, aiding attackers in crafting more effective injection attempts.
* **Metabase Security Settings:**  Certain Metabase configurations, such as allowing public embedding or insecure sharing options, could potentially expose the application to a wider range of attackers.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. Ensure that all database interactions, whether through the query builder or custom SQL, utilize parameterized queries.
* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before it is used in SQL queries. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only known good characters or patterns.
    * **Escaping:**  Converting special characters into a format that is not interpreted as SQL code.
    * **Data Type Validation:**  Ensuring input matches the expected data type.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the Metabase database user only the necessary permissions required for its functionality. Avoid using highly privileged accounts.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to filter out malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the Metabase application.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the importance of preventing SQL injection.
* **Regular Metabase Updates:**  Keep Metabase updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to mitigate potential XSS attacks that could be used in conjunction with SQL injection.
* **Database Activity Monitoring:**  Monitor database activity for suspicious queries and access patterns.
* **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  If the custom SQL query functionality is not essential, consider disabling it to reduce the attack surface. If it is necessary, implement strict access controls and auditing.
* **Review and Harden Metabase Configuration:**  Ensure Metabase is configured securely, including access controls, sharing settings, and embedding options.

**Conclusion:**

The "SQL Injection via Metabase Queries" attack path represents a significant security risk due to its potential for severe impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As a critical node in the attack tree, it requires immediate and focused attention. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly the adoption of parameterized queries and robust input validation, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful SQL injection attacks against the Metabase application. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and adherence to secure coding practices are essential for maintaining a strong security posture against this prevalent and dangerous vulnerability.
