## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Metabase Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_metabase_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means they have achieved unauthorized access to the application's sensitive data or functionality by leveraging weaknesses in Metabase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Metabase Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_metabase_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

This path involves attackers identifying and exploiting security flaws within the Metabase application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Metabase CVEs (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_metabase_cves__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that have been identified and potentially have available exploit code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE, XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__e_g___rce__xss_.md)

This involves finding CVEs affecting the specific Metabase version in use. Examples include Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing arbitrary code execution on the server, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing malicious script injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain initial access or execute arbitrary code on the Metabase server (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access_or_execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_metabase_server__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation can grant the attacker an initial foothold on the Metabase server, potentially allowing them to execute commands, install malware, or further compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Metabase Features for Malicious Purposes (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_metabase_features_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage the intended functionality of Metabase in unintended and harmful ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Metabase Queries (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_metabase_queries__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

Attackers craft malicious SQL queries that are then executed by Metabase against the connected databases. This can be done through Metabase's query builder or by manipulating custom SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious SQL queries through Metabase's query builder or custom SQL functionality](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_sql_queries_through_metabase's_query_builder_or_custom_sql_functionality.md)

This requires understanding SQL syntax and how Metabase constructs queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target underlying data sources connected to Metabase](./attack_tree_paths/target_underlying_data_sources_connected_to_metabase.md)

The malicious queries are aimed at the databases that Metabase is connected to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate sensitive data from the application's database (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_the_application's_database__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

A primary goal of SQL injection is to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, or business secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Metabase's Data Source Connection Features (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_metabase's_data_source_connection_features__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

Attackers manipulate the way Metabase connects to data sources to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious connection strings or credentials](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_connection_strings_or_credentials.md)

This could involve compromising stored credentials or injecting malicious connection parameters that point to attacker-controlled databases or systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to other systems or databases accessible from the Metabase server (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_other_systems_or_databases_accessible_from_the_metabase_server__critical_node_.md)

By compromising the data source connection, attackers can pivot from the Metabase server to other connected systems, potentially expanding their access within the application's infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Metabase Configuration Weaknesses (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_metabase_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers take advantage of insecure or default configurations within Metabase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

Metabase, like many applications, may have default administrator credentials that are publicly known or easily guessable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use default or easily guessable credentials for the Metabase administrator account](./attack_tree_paths/use_default_or_easily_guessable_credentials_for_the_metabase_administrator_account.md)

This is a very low-effort attack if default credentials haven't been changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain full control over the Metabase instance (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_full_control_over_the_metabase_instance__critical_node_.md)

Successfully logging in with default credentials grants the attacker complete administrative control over Metabase, allowing them to manipulate data, configurations, and potentially access connected databases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Metabase Users (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_metabase_users__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers manipulate individuals to gain access to Metabase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Attacks (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_attacks__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

Attackers send deceptive emails or messages designed to trick Metabase users into revealing their credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Metabase users with phishing emails to steal credentials](./attack_tree_paths/target_metabase_users_with_phishing_emails_to_steal_credentials.md)

These emails often mimic legitimate communications and direct users to fake login pages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to legitimate Metabase accounts (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_legitimate_metabase_accounts__critical_node_.md)

If successful, the attacker gains access to a valid Metabase user account, allowing them to operate within the application with the permissions of that user.
