### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Indirect SQL Injection via Metabase's Query Builder or Custom Expressions

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Vector

The core of this attack surface lies in the trust relationship between Metabase and the connected databases. Metabase acts as an intermediary, translating user actions into SQL queries. The vulnerability arises when this translation process fails to adequately sanitize or validate user-provided data within the Query Builder or Custom Expressions, allowing malicious SQL fragments to be injected indirectly.

**Breakdown of the Attack Flow:**

1. **Attacker Manipulation:** An attacker, potentially a compromised internal user or an external attacker who has gained access to Metabase, crafts a malicious input using either the Query Builder or Custom Expressions.
2. **Metabase Processing:** Metabase processes this input, attempting to translate it into a valid SQL query for the connected database.
3. **Flawed Translation:** Due to insufficient input validation or flawed logic in the translation process, the malicious input is incorporated into the generated SQL query without proper sanitization.
4. **Database Execution:** The database receives the crafted SQL query containing the injected malicious code and executes it.
5. **Impact:** The malicious SQL code performs unintended actions on the database, such as data extraction, modification, or denial of service.

#### 4.2. Potential Vulnerabilities in Metabase Components

Several areas within Metabase's architecture could be susceptible to this type of attack:

*   **Query Builder Logic:**
    *   **Insufficient Sanitization of Filter Values:** When users define filters, the values they provide might not be properly escaped or parameterized before being incorporated into the SQL WHERE clause. An attacker could inject SQL keywords or operators within these values.
    *   **Flaws in Handling Complex Filter Combinations:**  Complex filter logic involving AND/OR operators or nested conditions might introduce vulnerabilities if the parsing and translation logic is not robust.
    *   **Insecure Handling of Data Types:**  If Metabase doesn't correctly handle different data types when constructing queries, attackers might be able to bypass sanitization measures.

*   **Custom Expression Engine:**
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The custom expression engine might not adequately validate the syntax and content of user-defined expressions. This could allow attackers to inject SQL fragments disguised as valid expression syntax.
    *   **Insecure Function Handling:** If custom expressions allow the use of functions that directly interact with the database or perform string manipulation without proper sanitization, vulnerabilities could arise.
    *   **Type Coercion Issues:**  If the custom expression engine performs implicit type coercion in a way that can be manipulated, attackers might be able to inject malicious code.

*   **Translation Layer:**
    *   **Improper Parameterization:** While Metabase likely uses parameterized queries to prevent direct SQL injection, vulnerabilities could arise if parameterization is not consistently applied across all query generation paths, especially when dealing with dynamically generated parts of the query based on user input.
    *   **String Concatenation:** If Metabase relies on string concatenation to build SQL queries instead of using parameterized queries, it becomes highly susceptible to SQL injection.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Insufficient error handling during the query translation process might reveal information that could be used by attackers to craft more effective injection payloads.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Here are some potential attack vectors and scenarios:

*   **Malicious Filter Values:** An attacker could create a filter with a value like `' OR 1=1 -- ` which, if not properly sanitized, could lead to the execution of `SELECT ... WHERE column = 'value' OR 1=1 -- '`. The `--` comments out the rest of the query.
*   **Exploiting Custom Expression Functions:** An attacker might use a custom expression function in a way that injects SQL. For example, if a function allows direct string manipulation, they might construct an expression that concatenates malicious SQL.
*   **Manipulating Data Types in Custom Expressions:** An attacker might exploit type coercion vulnerabilities in custom expressions to inject SQL. For instance, if a string is implicitly converted to a number in a vulnerable way, they might inject SQL within the string.
*   **Combining Query Builder Features:** Attackers might combine different features of the Query Builder and Custom Expressions to bypass sanitization measures. For example, using a custom expression within a filter.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment (Expanded)

The impact of a successful indirect SQL injection attack can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the connected databases, leading to privacy violations, financial losses, and reputational damage.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, potentially disrupting business operations and causing data integrity issues.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the database, gaining access to more sensitive information or functionalities.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database, leading to service disruptions.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised database is connected to other systems, attackers might be able to use it as a stepping stone for further attacks.

#### 4.5. Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but can be further elaborated upon:

*   **Keep Metabase updated:** This is crucial as updates often include security patches. However, relying solely on updates is not sufficient.
*   **Carefully review and sanitize user input:** This is the most critical mitigation. The development team needs to implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms at every point where user input is incorporated into SQL queries. This includes:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Enforcing strict rules on the format and content of user input.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encoding data before it's used in SQL queries to prevent interpretation as code.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (with Placeholders):**  Ensuring that all dynamically generated SQL uses parameterized queries with placeholders for user-provided values. This prevents the database from interpreting user input as executable code.
    *   **Escaping Special Characters:**  Properly escaping special characters that have meaning in SQL.
*   **Limit the use of custom expressions to trusted users:** This reduces the attack surface but might not be practical in all environments. A more robust solution is to secure the custom expression functionality itself.
*   **Monitor database logs for suspicious query activity:** This is a reactive measure but essential for detecting and responding to attacks. Logs should be analyzed for unusual query patterns, syntax errors, or queries originating from Metabase that access sensitive data in unexpected ways.

#### 4.6. Recommendations for Development Team

To effectively mitigate the risk of indirect SQL injection, the development team should implement the following recommendations:

*   **Prioritize Secure Coding Practices:**  Emphasize secure coding principles throughout the development lifecycle, particularly when dealing with user input and database interactions.
*   **Implement Comprehensive Input Validation:**  Validate all user input received through the Query Builder and Custom Expressions. This includes checking data types, formats, and lengths. Use whitelisting (allowing only known good input) rather than blacklisting (blocking known bad input).
*   **Enforce Parameterized Queries:**  Strictly enforce the use of parameterized queries with placeholders for all dynamically generated SQL. Avoid string concatenation for building SQL queries.
*   **Secure Custom Expression Engine:**
    *   **Implement a robust parser:**  Ensure the custom expression parser is resilient to malicious input and cannot be tricked into interpreting SQL fragments.
    *   **Sanitize function arguments:**  If custom expressions allow functions, ensure that the arguments passed to these functions are properly sanitized.
    *   **Limit function capabilities:**  Restrict the capabilities of custom expression functions to prevent direct database interactions or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Consider a safe evaluation environment:** Explore the possibility of evaluating custom expressions in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
*   **Conduct Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to conduct regular audits and penetration tests specifically targeting this attack surface.
*   **Implement Automated Security Testing:**  Integrate automated security testing tools into the development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early on.
*   **Educate Users on Security Risks:**  Provide guidance to users on the potential risks associated with creating complex or untrusted custom expressions.
*   **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for preventing XSS, a well-configured CSP can offer some defense-in-depth by limiting the sources from which the application can load resources.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user Metabase uses has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. This limits the potential damage from a successful injection.
