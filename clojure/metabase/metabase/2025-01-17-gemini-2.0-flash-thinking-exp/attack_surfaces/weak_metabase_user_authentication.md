### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Weak Metabase User Authentication

**4.1. Contributing Factors within Metabase:**

* **Default Password Policy:**  The default password policy in Metabase might be too lenient, allowing users to set weak and easily guessable passwords. If not explicitly configured, it might lack requirements for minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and regular expiration.
* **Optional MFA:** While Metabase supports MFA, it might not be enforced by default or easily discoverable by administrators. The available MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, backup codes) and their implementation security need to be examined. If MFA is optional, users might not enable it, leaving their accounts vulnerable.
* **Lack of Centralized Password Management:**  If Metabase is managing its own user accounts and passwords, it introduces another system that needs to be secured. This can be less secure than relying on a robust, centralized Identity Provider (IdP) with established security controls.
* **Insecure Password Storage:**  While unlikely in a modern application, a vulnerability could exist in how Metabase stores user passwords. Ideally, passwords should be securely hashed using strong, salted hashing algorithms. Older versions or misconfigurations could potentially use weaker methods.
* **Insufficient Account Lockout Policies:**  If Metabase doesn't implement robust account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts, it becomes easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks. The lockout duration and threshold for triggering lockout are critical.
* **Weak Password Reset Mechanisms:**  Insecure password reset processes can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. This includes vulnerabilities like predictable reset links, lack of sufficient identity verification, or sending temporary passwords via insecure channels.
* **Session Management Vulnerabilities:**  Weak session management can allow attackers to hijack active user sessions. This could involve issues like predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation upon logout, or vulnerabilities to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that could steal session cookies.
* **Information Disclosure on Login Page:**  Error messages on the login page that differentiate between incorrect username and incorrect password can aid attackers in identifying valid usernames for targeted attacks.
* **Audit Logging Gaps:**  Insufficient or poorly configured audit logging for authentication-related events (successful logins, failed logins, password resets, MFA changes) can hinder detection and investigation of attacks.
* **Vulnerabilities in Integration with External Authentication:**  If Metabase integrates with external authentication providers, vulnerabilities in the integration configuration or the underlying protocols (e.g., misconfigured SAML assertions) could be exploited.

**4.2. Attack Vectors:**

* **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can attempt to guess user passwords by trying numerous combinations. Weak password policies and lack of account lockout make this more feasible.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords obtained from other breaches to try and log into Metabase.
* **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can trick users into revealing their Metabase credentials through deceptive emails or websites that mimic the Metabase login page.
* **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers use lists of common words and phrases as potential passwords.
* **Rainbow Table Attacks:** Pre-computed hashes of common passwords can be used to quickly crack weakly hashed passwords.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can attempt to steal or intercept active user sessions to gain unauthorized access without needing credentials.
* **Exploiting Password Reset Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can manipulate the password reset process to gain control of user accounts.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** If HTTPS is not properly enforced or configured, attackers could intercept login credentials transmitted over the network.

**4.3. Potential Impacts:**

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers gaining access can view, download, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data visualized and queried through Metabase. This could include financial data, customer information, business intelligence, and other confidential information.
* **Modification of Dashboards and Questions:** Attackers can alter dashboards and questions to spread misinformation, disrupt operations, or hide their malicious activities.
* **Lateral Movement to Connected Databases:** If Metabase user accounts have permissions to access connected databases, attackers could leverage compromised Metabase credentials to gain access to these underlying data sources, potentially leading to more significant data breaches or system compromise.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach involving sensitive data accessed through Metabase can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data may lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and result in significant fines and legal repercussions.
* **Business Disruption:**  Modification of critical dashboards or data can lead to incorrect business decisions and operational disruptions.

**4.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Minimum Length:** Mandate a minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters).
    * **Complexity Requirements:** Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
    * **Regular Password Expiration:**  Implement a policy for periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days).
    * **Consider using a password strength meter during password creation.**
* **Enable and Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Mandatory MFA:** Make MFA mandatory for all users, especially those with access to sensitive data.
    * **Support Multiple MFA Methods:** Offer a variety of MFA options (e.g., TOTP via authenticator apps, hardware security keys, email/SMS codes as a fallback, but with caution regarding SMS security).
    * **Educate users on the importance and proper use of MFA.**
* **Integrate with a Robust Identity Provider (IdP):**
    * **Centralized Authentication:** Leverage an IdP (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak) for centralized user management and authentication. This allows for consistent security policies and simplifies user management.
    * **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Implement SSO to improve user experience and reduce the number of passwords users need to manage.
    * **Leverage IdP Security Features:** Benefit from the advanced security features offered by the IdP, such as adaptive authentication, risk-based authentication, and stronger MFA options.
* **Regularly Review and Audit Metabase User Accounts and Permissions:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review user accounts and their assigned permissions to identify and remove unnecessary access.
    * **Automated Provisioning and Deprovisioning:** Implement automated processes for creating and deactivating user accounts based on employee lifecycle events.
