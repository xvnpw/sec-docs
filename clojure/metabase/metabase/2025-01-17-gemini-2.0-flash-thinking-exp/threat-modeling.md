# Threat Model Analysis for metabase/metabase

## Threat: [SQL Injection through User-Defined Parameters](./threats/sql_injection_through_user-defined_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating user-defined parameters in Metabase questions or dashboards. If Metabase does not properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs before executing them against the database, the attacker's SQL code will be executed.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the underlying database, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, bypass security controls, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Question Builder Module (parameter handling)
        *   Dashboard Filtering Functionality
        *   Database Connection and Query Execution Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements in Metabase's backend.
        *   Sanitize user-provided parameters before incorporating them into database queries.
        *   Enforce strict input validation on user-defined parameters within Metabase's question creation and dashboard filtering features.
        *   Adopt a principle of least privilege for database connections used by Metabase.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unintended Data Access](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unintended_data_access.md)

*   **Description:**  A user gains access to data they are not authorized to see due to misconfigured permissions within Metabase. This could be due to overly broad group permissions, flaws in Metabase's permission model, or the ability for users to craft queries that bypass intended access restrictions *within Metabase's query building interface*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, and competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Permission Management Module
        *   Data Access Control Logic
        *   Query Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust and granular permission model within Metabase, carefully defining access rights for users and groups.
        *   Regularly review and audit Metabase permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
        *   Educate users on data access policies and responsible data handling.
        *   Consider using data masking or row-level security features in the underlying databases to further restrict access.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Metabase's Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_metabase's_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or weaknesses exist in Metabase's authentication system (e.g., password reset mechanisms, session management) that could be exploited by attackers to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Metabase, allowing attackers to view sensitive data, modify configurations, or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Authentication Module
        *   Session Management
        *   Password Reset Functionality
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Metabase updated to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for all users.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Regularly review Metabase's security advisories and apply necessary patches.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in Metabase's authorization logic allow users to perform actions or access resources they are not intended to, even if they are authenticated. This could involve manipulating API requests *to Metabase's API* or exploiting inconsistencies in permission checks *within Metabase's code*.
    *   **Impact:**  Users gaining access to sensitive data or functionality beyond their intended privileges, potentially leading to data breaches, configuration changes, or disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Authorization Module
        *   API Endpoints
        *   Permission Enforcement Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and review Metabase's authorization logic.
        *   Implement robust access control checks at all relevant points in the application.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
        *   Regularly audit user permissions and access patterns.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities](./threats/api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in Metabase's API that could be exploited by attackers to perform unauthorized actions, access data, or disrupt the application. This includes risks like API key leakage *if Metabase manages them*, lack of proper rate limiting *within Metabase's API*, or vulnerabilities in specific API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Metabase API
        *   API Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
        *   Specific API Endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure API keys and tokens and avoid embedding them directly in client-side code.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
        *   Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Regularly audit and test the Metabase API for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Metabase-Specific Bugs and Vulnerabilities](./threats/metabase-specific_bugs_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Like any software, Metabase itself might contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Various Modules and Components within the Metabase Application
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Metabase updated to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to Metabase security advisories and mailing lists.
        *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Metabase development team.
