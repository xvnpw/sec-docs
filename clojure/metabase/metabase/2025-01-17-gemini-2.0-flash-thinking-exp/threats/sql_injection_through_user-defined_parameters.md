### 4. Deep Analysis of SQL Injection through User-Defined Parameters

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

SQL Injection through User-Defined Parameters occurs when an application incorporates user-supplied data directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. In the context of Metabase, this means that if a user can define parameters within a question or dashboard filter, and Metabase uses these parameters directly in the SQL query sent to the database, a malicious user can inject their own SQL code.

**How it works in Metabase:**

*   **Question Builder:** When creating a question, users can define filters based on various fields. These filters often involve user-defined values. If Metabase constructs the SQL query by simply concatenating these user-provided values into the query string, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Dashboard Filtering:** Similar to the Question Builder, dashboards allow users to add filters that apply to multiple cards. These filters also rely on user-defined values. If these values are not properly handled, they can be exploited for SQL injection.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a Metabase question with a filter on a "Product Name" field. Instead of providing a legitimate product name, an attacker could enter a malicious string like:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

If Metabase directly incorporates this into the SQL query without proper handling, the resulting query might look like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name = '' OR 1=1 --';
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended filter and potentially returning all rows from the `products` table. The `--` comments out the rest of the intended query, preventing errors.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors can be exploited through user-defined parameters in Metabase:

*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation in Question Builder:**  Attackers can craft malicious SQL within the filter values when creating or editing questions.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation in Dashboard Filters:** Similar to the Question Builder, attackers can inject malicious SQL through dashboard filter values.
*   **API Exploitation:** If Metabase exposes an API for creating or modifying questions and dashboards, attackers could potentially inject malicious SQL through API requests.
*   **Stored XSS leading to Parameter Manipulation:** While not directly SQL injection, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability could be used to manipulate the parameters of a question or dashboard on behalf of another user, leading to indirect SQL injection.

#### 4.3 Potential Impacts

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Attackers can execute queries to extract sensitive data from the database, including customer information, financial records, and intellectual property.
*   **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption, loss of business continuity, and regulatory compliance issues.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database connection used by Metabase has elevated privileges, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive database functionalities or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Attackers can bypass application-level security controls and directly interact with the database.

#### 4.4 Technical Deep Dive

The vulnerability stems from the way Metabase constructs and executes SQL queries based on user input. Without proper safeguards, user-provided parameter values are treated as trusted data and directly incorporated into the query string.

**Key areas of concern:**

*   **Lack of Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** If Metabase uses string concatenation to build SQL queries with user-provided parameters instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements, it is highly susceptible to SQL injection. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If Metabase does not validate and sanitize user-provided parameters to remove or escape potentially malicious characters, attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Database Connection Privileges:** The level of privileges granted to the database connection used by Metabase significantly impacts the potential damage from a successful SQL injection attack. If the connection has excessive privileges, the attacker's capabilities are greatly amplified.

#### 4.5 Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies

The proposed mitigation strategies are crucial for addressing this vulnerability:

*   **Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements:** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. By using placeholders for user-provided values, the database driver ensures that these values are treated as data, not executable code. **This is a critical and non-negotiable mitigation.**
*   **Sanitize user-provided parameters before incorporating them into database queries:** While less robust than parameterized queries, sanitization can help by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters. However, it's complex to implement correctly and can be bypassed. **This should be considered a secondary defense layer, not a primary one.**
*   **Enforce strict input validation on user-defined parameters within Metabase's question creation and dashboard filtering features:**  Validating the format, length, and allowed characters of user inputs can prevent some basic injection attempts. However, it's difficult to anticipate all possible malicious inputs. **This is a good preventative measure but not a complete solution.**
*   **Adopt a principle of least privilege for database connections used by Metabase:** Limiting the permissions of the database user used by Metabase reduces the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack. Even if an attacker gains access, their actions will be restricted by the database user's privileges. **This is a crucial security best practice.**

#### 4.6 Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are provided to the development team:

1. **Prioritize Implementation of Parameterized Queries:**  Immediately prioritize the implementation of parameterized queries or prepared statements throughout Metabase's codebase, especially in the Question Builder and Dashboard Filtering modules. This is the most effective way to eliminate the root cause of this vulnerability.
2. **Strengthen Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all user-defined parameters. Define clear rules for allowed characters, data types, and lengths. Use whitelisting (allowing only specific characters or patterns) rather than blacklisting (blocking specific characters).
3. **Implement Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  While parameterized queries are the primary defense, implement context-aware output encoding to further protect against potential injection vulnerabilities in other areas.
4. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities in the context of user-defined parameters.
5. **Security Training for Developers:** Ensure that developers are adequately trained on secure coding practices, particularly regarding SQL injection prevention.
6. **Review and Harden Database Connection Privileges:**  Thoroughly review the privileges granted to the database connection used by Metabase and adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions for Metabase to function correctly.
7. **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploying a WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by detecting and blocking malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the Metabase application.
8. **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of database queries and user activity to detect and respond to potential SQL injection attacks.

### 5. Conclusion

The threat of SQL Injection through User-Defined Parameters poses a significant risk to the security and integrity of the Metabase application and its underlying data. Implementing parameterized queries is paramount to effectively mitigate this vulnerability. Combining this with strong input validation, least privilege principles, and regular security assessments will significantly enhance Metabase's resilience against this critical threat. The development team should prioritize these recommendations to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the application.
