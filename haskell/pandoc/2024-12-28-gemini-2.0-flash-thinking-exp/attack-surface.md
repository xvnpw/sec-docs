Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Pandoc, with high and critical severity:

*   **Maliciously Crafted Input Files**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker provides a specially crafted document file in a format supported by Pandoc, designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Pandoc's parsing logic.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc's core functionality is parsing and processing various document formats. Vulnerabilities within these parsers (e.g., for Markdown, LaTeX, DOCX) can be triggered by malicious input.
    *   **Example:**  A specially crafted DOCX file with deeply nested elements or excessively large images could cause a buffer overflow in Pandoc's DOCX parser.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service (DoS), or unexpected program behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize input files before passing them to Pandoc.
        *   Implement file size limits for uploaded documents.
        *   Run Pandoc in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions.
        *   Keep Pandoc updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Resource Exhaustion via Complex Input**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker provides an extremely large or complex document that, while not necessarily exploiting a specific vulnerability, consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory) during Pandoc's conversion process.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc's conversion process can be resource-intensive for certain document structures or sizes.
    *   **Example:**  A very large Markdown file with thousands of deeply nested lists or a complex LaTeX document with numerous figures and equations could cause Pandoc to consume excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to a DoS.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service (DoS), impacting the availability of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for Pandoc conversion processes.
        *   Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Pandoc process.
        *   Queue conversion requests to prevent overwhelming the system.
        *   Consider pre-processing or simplifying very large input documents before passing them to Pandoc.

*   **Injection Attacks via Input Content**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker embeds malicious content within the input document that gets executed or interpreted in the output format, especially when converting to formats like HTML.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc, by design, translates content between formats. If not handled carefully, malicious content in the input can be carried over to the output.
    *   **Example:**  A Markdown file containing `<script>` tags will be directly translated into HTML `<script>` tags when converting to HTML, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the output is displayed in a web browser without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize the output generated by Pandoc, especially when converting to HTML, using libraries specifically designed for XSS prevention.
        *   Configure Pandoc to strip potentially dangerous elements from the output (e.g., using `--strip-scripts` for HTML output).
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in the web application to mitigate the impact of XSS.

*   **Path Traversal via Included Files/Resources**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts an input document that includes external files or resources using relative or absolute paths, potentially allowing access to sensitive files on the server.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Some input formats (e.g., Markdown with image links, LaTeX with `\includegraphics`) allow including external resources. Pandoc needs to resolve these paths.
    *   **Example:**  A Markdown file containing `![alt text](/etc/passwd)` could, in a vulnerable setup, cause Pandoc to attempt to access the `/etc/passwd` file on the server during processing.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable or restrict Pandoc's ability to access external files or resources.
        *   If external resources are necessary, use a whitelist of allowed directories or URLs.
        *   Sanitize and validate any paths provided in the input document.
        *   Run Pandoc in a chrooted environment to limit its access to the filesystem.
