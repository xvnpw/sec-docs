### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Pandoc

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Pandoc library:

**Threat:** Malicious Input Exploitation (Parser Vulnerability)
* **Description:** An attacker crafts a document in a supported Pandoc input format (e.g., Markdown, HTML, LaTeX) containing malicious syntax or structures that exploit a vulnerability in Pandoc's parsing logic. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running Pandoc, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, install malware, or access sensitive data.
* **Impact:** **Critical**. Full system compromise, data breach, service disruption.
* **Affected Pandoc Component:**  Specific input format parsers (e.g., `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown`, `Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML`, `Text.Pandoc.Readers.LaTeX`).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Pandoc updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    * Sanitize and validate user-provided input before passing it to Pandoc. This might involve stripping potentially dangerous elements or using a more restrictive input format if possible.
    * Consider running Pandoc in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

**Threat:** Malicious Input Exploitation (Resource Exhaustion)
* **Description:** An attacker provides an input document that, when processed by Pandoc, consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial of service. This could crash the application or make it unresponsive.
* **Impact:** **High**. Service disruption, application unavailability.
* **Affected Pandoc Component:** Core processing engine (`Text.Pandoc.Definition`, `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory limits) for the Pandoc process.
    * Set maximum file size limits for input documents.
    * Implement timeouts for Pandoc processing.
    * Monitor system resource usage and alert on unusual activity.

**Threat:** Output Manipulation Leading to XSS
* **Description:** An attacker crafts an input document that, when converted by Pandoc to an output format like HTML, includes malicious scripts. If the application serving the output doesn't properly sanitize it, these scripts can be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.
* **Impact:** **High**. User account compromise, data theft, malware distribution.
* **Affected Pandoc Component:** Output format writers (e.g., `Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML`).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly sanitize Pandoc's output before displaying it to users. Use appropriate HTML escaping techniques.
    * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in External Programs Called by Pandoc
* **Description:** Pandoc relies on external programs (e.g., LaTeX, Graphviz) for certain conversions. If these external programs have vulnerabilities, and Pandoc calls them with unsanitized input, it could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Impact:** **High**. Potential system compromise depending on the vulnerability in the external program.
* **Affected Pandoc Component:**  Modules responsible for calling external programs (e.g., within specific writers).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep all external programs used by Pandoc updated to the latest versions.
    * Sanitize input passed to external programs.
    * Consider using alternative methods or libraries if the risk associated with a particular external program is too high.
