# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jgm/pandoc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Format Restriction](./mitigation_strategies/output_format_restriction.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Output Format Restriction
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Output Formats:** Analyze application functionality to determine the *absolute minimum* set of output formats Pandoc needs to generate.
    2.  **Restrict Output Formats in Pandoc Invocation:** When calling Pandoc from your application, explicitly specify the allowed output formats using Pandoc's command-line options (e.g., `--to html`, `--to plain`).  Avoid allowing users to control the output format directly if possible.
    3.  **Default to Safest Output:** If a choice of output formats is necessary, default to the safest format possible (e.g., plain text) and require explicit, controlled selection of more complex formats.
    4.  **Disable Unnecessary Format Support (If Possible):** Explore if Pandoc can be configured or compiled to disable support for certain output formats at a deeper level, though this might be less practical for pre-built Pandoc binaries.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Output (High Severity):** Generating complex output formats like HTML or EPUB increases the risk of inadvertently including or allowing malicious code in the output. Restricting output formats reduces this risk by limiting the complexity of the generated content.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities in Output Generation (Medium Severity):**  Pandoc might have vulnerabilities in the code that generates specific output formats. Limiting output formats reduces the attack surface by reducing the amount of output generation code exercised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Output:** Medium - Reduces risk by limiting the generation of complex, potentially scriptable output formats.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities in Output Generation:** Medium - Reduces attack surface by limiting the output format generation code used.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `/convert` endpoint currently hardcodes output to HTML fragment (`-f markdown -t html5 --no-wrap`). This implicitly restricts output format, but is not explicitly configurable or enforced beyond this single format.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Output format restriction is not configurable. The application should have a mechanism to explicitly define and enforce a whitelist of allowed output formats for Pandoc.
    *   There is no mechanism to default to a safer output format if format selection is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Template Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_template_usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Template Usage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Built-in Templates When Possible:**  Favor using Pandoc's built-in templates whenever feasible. These are generally well-vetted and less likely to contain malicious code compared to custom templates.
    2.  **Source Templates from Trusted Locations:** If custom templates are necessary, obtain them only from highly trusted and reputable sources. Verify the integrity of templates (e.g., using checksums) if downloaded from external sources.
    3.  **Restrict User-Provided Templates:**  **Never** allow users to upload or provide arbitrary custom Pandoc templates. This is a significant security risk as templates can contain arbitrary code or directives that Pandoc will execute.
    4.  **Template Review and Auditing:** If using custom templates, thoroughly review and audit them for any potentially malicious code, directives, or unintended behaviors. Treat templates as code and apply code review principles.
    5.  **Template Sandboxing (Advanced):**  Explore if Pandoc or the environment it runs in offers any mechanisms for sandboxing or isolating template execution to limit the potential impact of malicious template code. (Note: Pandoc's template system is not designed with strong sandboxing in mind).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Template Injection (Critical Severity):** Maliciously crafted Pandoc templates could contain code or directives that, when processed by Pandoc, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Pandoc.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Template Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Templates might be manipulated to extract sensitive information from the server environment or application context during Pandoc processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Template Injection:** High -  Significantly reduces the risk of RCE by preventing the use of untrusted or malicious templates.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Template Manipulation:** Medium - Reduces the risk of information disclosure by controlling template sources and content.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Currently, no custom templates are explicitly used. The application relies on Pandoc's default templates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While not currently using custom templates, there is no explicit policy or code to prevent the future introduction of user-provided or untrusted templates.  This should be explicitly documented and enforced in development practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pandoc Version Control and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/pandoc_version_control_and_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Pandoc Version Control and Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Pin Pandoc Version:**  In your project's dependency management file (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`), explicitly specify and pin the *exact* version of Pandoc being used, including patch versions. This ensures consistent builds and prevents accidental upgrades to vulnerable versions.
    2.  **Security Monitoring for Pandoc:**  Actively monitor security advisories, vulnerability databases (CVEs), and Pandoc release notes specifically for security-related updates and vulnerabilities affecting the version you are using.
    3.  **Regular Pandoc Updates (with Testing):** Establish a process for regularly (e.g., monthly) checking for Pandoc security updates. When updates are available, thoroughly test the new version in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
    4.  **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to scan your dependencies, including Pandoc, for known vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Pandoc Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):** Pandoc, like any software, may have security vulnerabilities discovered over time. Using outdated versions exposes the application to these known vulnerabilities, which attackers can exploit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Pandoc Vulnerabilities:** High - Directly mitigates the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Pandoc by ensuring the application uses patched and up-to-date versions.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Pandoc version is specified in the `Dockerfile`, but it's currently pinned to a major version (`pandoc:2`) which might pull in newer *minor* versions and potentially introduce regressions or even vulnerabilities if not carefully managed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Pandoc version should be pinned to a specific *patch* version in the `Dockerfile` and dependency management.
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning for Pandoc and its dependencies is not implemented.
    *   A documented and enforced process for regular Pandoc security updates and testing is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Restrict External Filters](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_restrict_external_filters.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Restrict External Filters
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Filter Usage:**  Carefully evaluate if your application truly requires the use of Pandoc's external filters (`--filter` option). External filters introduce significant security risks.
    2.  **Disable Filters if Unnecessary:** If external filters are not essential, configure your application to explicitly *not* use the `--filter` option when invoking Pandoc.
    3.  **Whitelist Allowed Filters (If Necessary):** If external filters are absolutely required, create a strict whitelist of allowed filter names or paths.  **Never** allow users to specify filter paths directly.
    4.  **Source Filters from Trusted Locations:** Ensure that any whitelisted external filters are sourced only from highly trusted and controlled locations. Verify their integrity and security.
    5.  **Filter Security Auditing:**  Treat external filters as highly sensitive code.  Thoroughly audit the code of any external filters for security vulnerabilities before deploying them.
    6.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Filters:** If filters are executed, ensure they run with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via External Filters (Critical Severity):** Pandoc's `--filter` option allows execution of arbitrary external programs. If not carefully controlled, this can be a direct path to RCE if an attacker can control the filter path or the content of a filter.
    *   **Command Injection via Filter Arguments (High Severity):** Even if filter paths are controlled, vulnerabilities in how Pandoc passes arguments to filters or how filters process arguments could lead to command injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via External Filters:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of RCE by disabling or strictly controlling the use of external filters.
    *   **Command Injection via Filter Arguments:** Medium - Reduces risk by limiting filter usage and requiring careful auditing of filter code and argument handling.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application currently does not use the `--filter` option when invoking Pandoc.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While not currently used, there is no explicit code or configuration to prevent the future accidental or intentional use of `--filter` in the application.  This should be enforced in code and development guidelines.
