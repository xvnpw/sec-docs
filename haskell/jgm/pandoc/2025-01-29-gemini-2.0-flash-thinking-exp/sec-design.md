# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Pandoc, is a universal document converter. Its primary business priority is to provide a robust and versatile tool for converting documents between various markup and document formats. The main business goal is to enable users to easily transform documents from one format to another, facilitating interoperability and workflow efficiency across different platforms and applications.

Key business risks associated with Pandoc include:
- Data loss or corruption during the conversion process, potentially leading to inaccurate or incomplete documents.
- Incorrect or unexpected document formatting after conversion, which could impact readability and usability.
- Performance bottlenecks, especially when handling large or complex documents, affecting user productivity.
- Lack of support for emerging or less common document formats, limiting the tool's applicability.
- Security vulnerabilities in the conversion process that could be exploited to compromise user systems or data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for Pandoc:
- security control: Memory safety provided by Haskell, the programming language Pandoc is written in, mitigates certain classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented in: Pandoc codebase.
- security control: Input parsing and validation are performed to handle various document formats. Implemented in: Pandoc source code, format-specific readers.
- security control: Regular updates and bug fixes are released by the maintainers, addressing reported issues including security vulnerabilities. Described in: Pandoc release notes and commit history.

Accepted risks for Pandoc:
- accepted risk: Users are responsible for the security of the environment where Pandoc is executed, including the security of input and output files.
- accepted risk: Complex document formats may have inherent parsing ambiguities or vulnerabilities that are difficult to fully mitigate.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- recommended security control: Implement automated fuzzing to proactively identify potential parsing vulnerabilities across different document formats.
- recommended security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the build process to automatically detect code-level security flaws.
- recommended security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Pandoc.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle reported security issues effectively.

Security requirements for Pandoc:
- Authentication: Not applicable. Pandoc is a command-line tool and does not require user authentication.
- Authorization: Not applicable. Pandoc operates on files provided by the user and does not require authorization mechanisms.
- Input validation: Robust input validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities arising from maliciously crafted documents. Pandoc must validate input data against expected formats and structures for all supported document types.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Pandoc's primary function of document conversion. However, if Pandoc is extended to handle encrypted documents or secure communication in the future, appropriate cryptographic measures will be necessary.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process to protect: Document conversion functionality. Ensuring accurate, reliable, and secure document conversion is paramount to Pandoc's value proposition.

Data to protect: User documents being converted. Sensitivity of data varies depending on the user and the content of the documents. Documents can range from publicly available information to highly confidential business or personal data. The sensitivity level is user-dependent and Pandoc as a tool must be designed to handle potentially sensitive data securely, even though it does not store or manage this data persistently.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the most common use cases for Pandoc in enterprise environments? (e.g., document archival, content migration, report generation).
- Are there any plans to offer Pandoc as a cloud service or integrate it with web applications in the future?
- What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports and releasing security patches?
- Are there any specific document formats that are considered higher risk from a security perspective?

Assumptions:
- Pandoc is primarily used as a command-line tool executed by users on their local machines or servers.
- Users are responsible for the security of their own environments, including input and output files.
- Pandoc's development prioritizes security and aims to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in document parsing and conversion.
- The Haskell programming language provides a degree of inherent memory safety, reducing the risk of certain types of vulnerabilities.
