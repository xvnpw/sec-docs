# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jgm/pandoc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Format Restriction](./mitigation_strategies/input_format_restriction.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze your application's needs and determine the minimal set of input formats that *must* be processed by Pandoc.
    2.  Utilize Pandoc's `--from` command-line option or equivalent API settings to explicitly declare the allowed input formats.
    3.  Implement application-level validation to ensure incoming documents adhere to the permitted formats *before* invoking Pandoc. Reject any input that does not match the allowed types.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the number of parsers Pandoc activates, thereby decreasing exposure to potential vulnerabilities within less common or more complex format parsers in Pandoc.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Format-Specific Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input format is currently restricted to Markdown and plain text in the document upload module, implicitly limiting Pandoc's parsers used in this module.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to explicitly enforce format restriction using Pandoc's `--from` option in all Pandoc invocations and at the API level to prevent bypassing upload module checks and ensure consistent format handling across all Pandoc usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (Pandoc Format Aware)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__pandoc_format_aware_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Select a sanitization library appropriate for the input formats you allow Pandoc to process (e.g., for Markdown, use a Markdown-aware sanitizer).
    2.  Prior to passing user-provided input to Pandoc, sanitize it using the chosen library. This step should be format-aware, understanding the structure of the input format Pandoc will parse.
    3.  Configure the sanitizer to remove or neutralize elements that could be misinterpreted or exploited by Pandoc's parsers, such as:
        *   Potentially harmful Markdown extensions or syntax that Pandoc might process in unexpected ways.
        *   HTML elements embedded within Markdown (if allowed) that could introduce XSS risks even after Pandoc conversion.
        *   Control characters or unusual encodings that could confuse Pandoc's parsing logic.
    4.  Validate the sanitized input against expected schemas or patterns relevant to the input format to ensure it's well-formed and doesn't contain structures that could trigger parser errors or vulnerabilities in Pandoc.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Parser Exploits in Pandoc (High Severity):** Prevents malicious input from reaching Pandoc's parsers in a form that could trigger vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior within Pandoc's parsing engine.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Input processed by Pandoc (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of injecting malicious scripts through input formats that Pandoc might process and carry over into output formats like HTML, even if the input format itself is not directly HTML.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Parser Exploits in Pandoc:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Input processed by Pandoc:** Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation (length limits, character whitelisting) is in place for document titles, which are sometimes passed to Pandoc for output generation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive, format-aware sanitization of the *document content* itself before processing with Pandoc is missing. Need to integrate a format-specific sanitization library (e.g., Markdown sanitizer) before invoking Pandoc.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Command-Line Argument Sanitization for Pandoc Subprocess](./mitigation_strategies/command-line_argument_sanitization_for_pandoc_subprocess.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all locations in your code where Pandoc is executed as a subprocess and where user-provided data is incorporated into the Pandoc command-line arguments.
    2.  Strictly avoid direct string concatenation when constructing Pandoc command strings.
    3.  Utilize parameterized command execution or argument escaping mechanisms provided by your programming language's subprocess libraries to safely pass arguments to the Pandoc command. These mechanisms handle escaping special characters that could be misinterpreted by the shell or Pandoc itself.
    4.  If parameterization is not fully possible for certain arguments, implement robust whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns for user-provided data that becomes part of the Pandoc command line. Validate against these whitelists before command construction.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via Pandoc Invocation (Critical Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands into the Pandoc command line through user-controlled input, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting Pandoc.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection via Pandoc Invocation:** High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for output file naming when using Pandoc. User-provided document titles are sanitized before being used in output file paths passed to Pandoc.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to thoroughly review all Pandoc command-line argument construction throughout the project to ensure consistent sanitization and parameterization, especially as more complex Pandoc features and options are integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Format Selection for Secure Pandoc Usage](./mitigation_strategies/output_format_selection_for_secure_pandoc_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Carefully evaluate the security implications of each Pandoc output format in the context of your application.
    2.  Prioritize and default to the most secure and least complex output format that adequately serves your application's requirements. For instance, if plain text or PDF output is sufficient, avoid using HTML output if possible due to its inherent complexity and XSS potential.
    3.  If HTML output from Pandoc is necessary, ensure that robust output sanitization (as described in the next mitigation strategy) is *always* applied.
    4.  Consider offering users a choice of output formats, but clearly communicate the security implications of more complex formats like HTML, and guide them towards safer options when appropriate.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Pandoc Output (Medium Severity):** Choosing simpler output formats reduces the complexity of Pandoc's output generation and minimizes the potential for introducing XSS vulnerabilities through the generated content.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Pandoc Output:** Medium risk reduction (can be high if HTML output is avoided entirely or significantly restricted).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application defaults to PDF output for document downloads, reducing the default exposure to HTML-related XSS risks from Pandoc output.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to explicitly discourage or restrict HTML output generation from Pandoc unless absolutely necessary.  Developers should be made fully aware of the increased security responsibility and the necessity of output sanitization when HTML output from Pandoc is used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Sanitization of Pandoc HTML Output](./mitigation_strategies/output_sanitization_of_pandoc_html_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When HTML output is generated by Pandoc, *always* process it through a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify, Bleach) *before* displaying it in a web browser or any other potentially vulnerable environment.
    2.  Configure the HTML sanitization library with a strict allowlist of permitted HTML tags, attributes, and CSS properties. Remove or neutralize any HTML elements, attributes, or JavaScript that are not explicitly on the allowlist.
    3.  Specifically disable or carefully control potentially dangerous HTML features that Pandoc might generate or pass through, such as inline JavaScript, forms, active content, and potentially risky HTML tags like `<iframe>` or `<object>`.
    4.  Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in your web application to provide an additional layer of defense against XSS by further restricting the capabilities of loaded HTML and controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute, complementing the output sanitization.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Pandoc HTML Output (High Severity):** Prevents malicious or unintended JavaScript or HTML from being executed in a user's browser due to unsanitized HTML output generated by Pandoc, even if the input was not directly malicious.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Pandoc HTML Output:** High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. HTML output from Pandoc is currently generated and served directly in certain preview features without any sanitization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Critically missing. HTML output sanitization *must* be implemented immediately for all features that display Pandoc-generated HTML to mitigate a significant XSS risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure PDF Generation Process with Pandoc](./mitigation_strategies/secure_pdf_generation_process_with_pandoc.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When generating PDFs using Pandoc, be mindful of the underlying PDF engine used. If relying on external engines like LaTeX or wkhtmltopdf, ensure these tools are consistently updated to their latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities within them.
    2.  Explore and prioritize using Pandoc's built-in PDF generation capabilities (if suitable for your needs), as these might have a smaller attack surface and be less complex than relying on external, potentially more vulnerable, tools.
    3.  If PDFs are offered for user download, display a clear security warning to users about the potential risks associated with opening PDFs from untrusted sources. PDFs can contain embedded scripts or other malicious content that could be exploited by PDF viewers.
    4.  If feasible, configure the PDF generation process (either within Pandoc or the external engine) to disable or restrict potentially dangerous features within the generated PDFs, such as JavaScript embedding or active content, to minimize the risk of malicious PDF documents.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in External PDF Engines used by Pandoc (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in external tools that Pandoc might utilize for PDF creation, if applicable.
    *   **Malicious PDF Content Generation via Pandoc (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks associated with Pandoc potentially passing through or generating malicious content within PDFs, although user awareness and secure PDF viewer practices are also important.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in External PDF Engines used by Pandoc:** Medium risk reduction.
    *   **Malicious PDF Content Generation via Pandoc:** Low to Medium risk reduction (relies on user awareness, PDF feature control, and Pandoc's own PDF generation behavior).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. External PDF engine (wkhtmltopdf) is used and is periodically updated, but this is a manual process.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to investigate Pandoc's built-in PDF generation as a potentially safer alternative.  Also, missing user-facing security warnings about PDF downloads and configuration options to restrict PDF features during generation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Pandoc's External Resource Fetching by Default](./mitigation_strategies/disable_pandoc's_external_resource_fetching_by_default.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure Pandoc to *default* to disabling the fetching of external resources (like images, includes, stylesheets from URLs) during document conversion. This can be achieved using Pandoc's `--no-network` command-line option or equivalent API settings.
    2.  If fetching external resources is genuinely required for specific, controlled use cases, implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or protocols that Pandoc is permitted to access.
    3.  When external resources are necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any URLs provided in the input to ensure they conform to the whitelist and prevent Pandoc from accessing internal network resources or malicious external sites.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Pandoc (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from leveraging Pandoc to make unauthorized requests to internal resources or external malicious sites by controlling URLs processed by Pandoc.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Pandoc SSRF (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of exposing internal resources or sensitive data through SSRF vulnerabilities exploited via Pandoc's external resource fetching capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Pandoc:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Pandoc SSRF:** Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Pandoc is currently allowed to fetch external resources by default, increasing the potential for SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement `--no-network` as the default setting for all Pandoc invocations and introduce a carefully controlled mechanism for whitelisting allowed external resources only when absolutely necessary for specific features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File System Access Control for Pandoc Processes](./mitigation_strategies/file_system_access_control_for_pandoc_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Run Pandoc processes with the minimal file system permissions necessary for their intended function. Use dedicated, low-privilege user accounts for executing Pandoc.
    2.  If Pandoc needs to access local files (e.g., for includes or processing local resources), strictly validate and sanitize all file paths provided in the input to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure access is limited to intended files within allowed directories.
    3.  Restrict Pandoc's file system access at the operating system level to a specific directory or set of directories that are absolutely required for its operation. Prevent access to sensitive system files or directories.
    4.  Consider employing containerization technologies (like Docker) or chroot environments to further isolate Pandoc's execution environment and tightly control its file system access, limiting it to only the essential paths and files.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Inclusion via Pandoc (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from using Pandoc to include and process arbitrary files from the server's file system by manipulating file paths in the input.
    *   **Local File Information Disclosure via Pandoc (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive local files through arbitrary file inclusion vulnerabilities exploited through Pandoc.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Inclusion via Pandoc:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Local File Information Disclosure via Pandoc:** High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Pandoc runs under a dedicated user account, but file system access is not strictly limited beyond standard user permissions for that account.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement stricter file system access controls specifically for Pandoc processes, potentially using chroot or containerization. Also, enforce robust path validation and sanitization for any features that involve file inclusion or local resource processing by Pandoc.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Pandoc Processes (DoS Prevention)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_pandoc_processes__dos_prevention_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement timeouts for all Pandoc processing operations to prevent excessively long-running conversions from consuming resources indefinitely and causing denial of service. Set reasonable time limits based on expected document sizes and conversion complexity.
    2.  Utilize operating system-level resource limits (e.g., cgroups, ulimits) to strictly restrict the CPU and memory usage of Pandoc processes. This prevents a single Pandoc process from monopolizing server resources.
    3.  Implement input size limits to prevent the processing of excessively large documents by Pandoc, as very large documents can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.
    4.  Consider using a queuing system to manage incoming Pandoc processing requests. This helps to regulate the load on the server and prevent overload during peak usage or denial-of-service attempts by limiting the number of concurrent Pandoc processes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Pandoc Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server and causing a denial of service by submitting resource-intensive conversion requests that exploit Pandoc's processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Pandoc Resource Exhaustion:** High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Timeouts are set for Pandoc processes to prevent indefinite hangs. Input size limits are in place for document uploads to limit the size of documents processed by Pandoc.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement OS-level resource limits (cgroups/ulimits) to strictly control CPU and memory usage of Pandoc processes.  Consider implementing a queuing system for managing Pandoc requests to further enhance DoS protection and improve resource management under load.
