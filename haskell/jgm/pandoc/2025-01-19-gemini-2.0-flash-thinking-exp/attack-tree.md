## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via Pandoc Exploitation *** (Critical Node) ***](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_pandoc_exploitation___critical_node_.md)

* **Root: Compromise Application via Pandoc Exploitation (Critical Node):**
    * This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. All subsequent steps are aimed at achieving this compromise. Successful exploitation at any of the critical nodes or via high-risk paths can lead to this outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND: Provide Malicious Input to Pandoc *** (Critical Node) ***](./attack_tree_paths/and_provide_malicious_input_to_pandoc___critical_node_.md)

* **AND: Provide Malicious Input to Pandoc (Critical Node):**
    * This is the initial and necessary step for all Pandoc-related attacks. The attacker must supply crafted input designed to exploit a vulnerability in Pandoc's processing.

    * **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Markdown Parser (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Crafting a specific Markdown structure that causes Pandoc's parser to write data beyond the allocated buffer.
        * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
        * **Mitigation:** Ensure Pandoc is updated to the latest version with buffer overflow fixes. Consider sandboxing Pandoc processes.

            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting LaTeX commands that allow execution of shell commands (e.g., using `\write18` if enabled).
            * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
            * **Mitigation:** Disable LaTeX shell execution using the `--no-tex-shell` option. Sanitize LaTeX input to remove potentially dangerous commands.

    * **Exploit Other Supported Format Parsing Flaws (e.g., Docx, EPUB) (Potentially High-Risk Path):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the parsers for other document formats (e.g., XML External Entity (XXE) injection in Docx parsing).
        * **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
        * **Mitigation:** Keep Pandoc and its dependencies updated. Sanitize input for these formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pandoc's Filter Mechanism *** (Critical Node) ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pandoc's_filter_mechanism___critical_node_.md)

        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious Lua code into a filter that Pandoc executes.
        * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
        * **Mitigation:** Avoid allowing users to specify arbitrary filters. If filters are necessary, ensure they are from trusted sources and are thoroughly vetted. Run filter execution in a sandboxed environment.
