# Threat Model Analysis for jgm/pandoc

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious HTML Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_html_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted HTML code as input to Pandoc. Pandoc processes this input, and if the output format is HTML, the malicious script is included in the generated output *by Pandoc*. When a user views this output in their browser, the script executes, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application interface.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** Input Processing (specifically when handling HTML input).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate user-provided HTML input *before* passing it to Pandoc. Use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove potentially malicious tags and attributes.
    *   If possible, avoid allowing users to provide raw HTML input. Offer alternative, safer input formats.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   Encode the output generated by Pandoc before displaying it in the browser to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote Includes](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_remote_includes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input in a format (e.g., Markdown with extensions, LaTeX) that allows including content from remote URLs. The attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal resource or a malicious external site. *Pandoc*, when processing this input, makes a request to the specified URL from the server. This can be used to access internal services not exposed to the public internet or to perform actions on external sites from the server's IP address.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, abuse of external services, denial of service.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** Input Processing (specifically when handling features that allow remote includes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable or restrict the use of features that allow including content from remote URLs in Pandoc's configuration.
    *   If remote includes are necessary, implement a strict allowlist of permitted domains or protocols.
    *   Validate and sanitize URLs provided in the input to ensure they point to expected and safe resources.
    *   Run Pandoc in a network environment with restricted outbound access.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Filters or LaTeX Commands](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_filters_or_latex_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Pandoc allows the use of filters (external scripts) and, in the case of LaTeX input/output, the execution of arbitrary LaTeX commands. If the application allows user-controlled input to influence the filters used or the LaTeX commands executed, an attacker could inject malicious commands that are then executed on the server *by Pandoc* with the privileges of the Pandoc process.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breaches, installation of malware.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** Filter Processing, LaTeX Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable the use of filters if they are not strictly necessary.
    *   If filters are required, carefully control which filters are allowed and ensure they are from trusted sources. Avoid allowing user-provided or dynamically generated filter paths.
    *   For LaTeX processing, disable or restrict the use of potentially dangerous commands.
    *   Run Pandoc in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to minimize the impact of successful code execution.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_output.md)

*   **Description:** Due to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in *Pandoc's* conversion process for certain input formats, the generated output (especially HTML) might contain unintended JavaScript code. This could occur even if the original input did not explicitly contain script tags. When a user views this output, the malicious script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application interface.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** Output Generation (for specific input/output format combinations).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and encode the output generated by Pandoc before displaying it in the browser.
    *   Keep Pandoc updated to the latest version, as vulnerabilities leading to this issue might be patched.
    *   Carefully test different input formats and their corresponding HTML outputs for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of executed scripts.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Pandoc relies on various libraries and external tools for certain conversion tasks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited *through Pandoc* if not properly managed and updated.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including RCE, DoS, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** External Dependencies (specific to the vulnerable dependency).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Pandoc and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
    *   Perform security scanning of Pandoc's dependencies to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_configuration_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of Pandoc, such as allowing unsafe LaTeX commands or disabling security features *within Pandoc*, can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to various attacks, including RCE, SSRF, or information disclosure, depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Affected Pandoc Component:** Configuration Settings, Command-line Arguments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the misconfiguration).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security best practices when configuring Pandoc.
    *   Disable features that are not strictly necessary.
    *   Carefully review the documentation for all configuration options and command-line arguments.
    *   Use the principle of least privilege when configuring Pandoc's execution environment.
