# Threat Model Analysis for jgm/pandoc

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Access via Input](./threats/arbitrary_file_access_via_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted input document that, when processed by Pandoc, causes it to read files outside of the intended input directory. The attacker might manipulate the input to include links or references to sensitive files on the server's file system.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information contained in the accessed files.

**Affected Component:** Pandoc's input parsing and file handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate input file paths rigorously.
*   Run Pandoc in a sandboxed environment with restricted file system access.
*   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in file paths passed to Pandoc.
*   Configure Pandoc to restrict access to external files or disable features that allow external resource inclusion if not needed.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Filters or External Tools](./threats/command_injection_via_filters_or_external_tools.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an input document or manipulates Pandoc's configuration to execute arbitrary commands on the server by exploiting how Pandoc handles filters or by providing malicious paths to external tools used by Pandoc.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** Pandoc's filter execution mechanism and its handling of external tool paths.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable or restrict the use of Pandoc filters if not strictly necessary.
*   If filters are required, ensure they are developed and reviewed with security in mind, and avoid using user-provided input directly in filter commands.
*   Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed external tools and their trusted locations.
*   Do not allow users to specify paths to external tools.
*   Run Pandoc with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Pandoc Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_pandoc_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Pandoc library itself by providing specific input documents that trigger memory corruption issues within Pandoc's code.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Any part of Pandoc's codebase containing the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Pandoc updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories related to Pandoc.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an input document that, when converted by Pandoc (especially to HTML), generates output containing malicious JavaScript code that can execute in a user's browser.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Affected Component:** Pandoc's output generation logic for HTML and related formats.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize Pandoc's output before rendering it in a web browser.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Threat: [File System Manipulation via Output](./threats/file_system_manipulation_via_output.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Pandoc to generate files on the server based on user input, an attacker could manipulate the input to control the output file path, potentially overwriting critical system files or creating files in unintended locations.

**Impact:**  Data loss, system instability, or potential for further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Pandoc's file output handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly use user-provided input to construct output file paths.
*   Enforce strict whitelisting of allowed output directories.
*   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for output files.
*   Run Pandoc with restricted file system write permissions.
