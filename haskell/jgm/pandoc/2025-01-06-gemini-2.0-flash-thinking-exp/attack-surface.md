# Attack Surface Analysis for jgm/pandoc

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Files Exploiting Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_files_exploiting_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Pandoc relies on parsers for various input formats. Carefully crafted malicious input files can exploit vulnerabilities within these parsers.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc's core function is to process diverse input formats, making it inherently reliant on the robustness of its parsing libraries. If these parsers have vulnerabilities, Pandoc becomes a conduit for exploiting them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specially formatted Markdown file with sequences that trigger a buffer overflow or infinite loop in Pandoc's Markdown parser.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Pandoc process or consuming excessive resources. Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the parser vulnerability is severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Pandoc Updated:** Regularly update Pandoc to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its parsers.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of input files *before* passing them to Pandoc. Check file sizes, content type (if possible), and potentially use a sandboxed environment for initial processing.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for the Pandoc process to mitigate DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in XML-based Input Formats](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_in_xml-based_input_formats.md)

*   **Description:** When processing XML-based input formats (like DOCX internally), Pandoc might be vulnerable to XXE attacks if not configured to disable external entity processing.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc's ability to process formats like DOCX, which are based on XML, means it utilizes XML parsing libraries that are susceptible to XXE if not configured securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a DOCX file containing a malicious XML payload that instructs Pandoc to access local files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or internal network resources.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure by reading local files on the server. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) allowing the attacker to interact with internal or external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable External Entity Processing:** Configure Pandoc or the underlying XML parsing libraries to disable the processing of external entities. This is often a configuration option.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize or strip potentially malicious XML elements from input files before processing with Pandoc.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Pandoc process with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of successful XXE attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Output Format Features](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_output_format_features.md)

*   **Description:** Certain output formats or Pandoc extensions might allow for the execution of external commands during the rendering process. If user input influences the generation of these commands, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **How Pandoc Contributes:** Pandoc's flexibility in supporting various output formats and extensions means that some of these features might inherently allow for command execution.
    *   **Example:** Using a LaTeX output format with an extension that allows for shell commands, an attacker could craft input that injects malicious commands into the LaTeX compilation process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server running Pandoc, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Risky Output Features:** Avoid using output formats or extensions that allow for external command execution unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If such features are required, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization of any user input that influences the command generation process.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Pandoc process with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of successful command injection.
