# Attack Tree Analysis for jgm/pandoc

Objective: Compromise the application utilizing Pandoc by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within Pandoc's processing or configuration.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Attack: Compromise Application via Pandoc Exploitation
    * **[High-Risk Path]** Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node)**
        * **[High-Risk Path]** Inject Malicious Code via Input Format **(Critical Node)**
            * **[High-Risk Path]** Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST (-> Execute XSS if output is web-facing or potentially RCE if mishandled server-side)
            * **[High-Risk Path]** Inject LaTeX Commands (-> Potential for command execution if Pandoc's LaTeX engine is vulnerable or if output is processed insecurely)
        * **[High-Risk Path]** Exploit File Inclusion/Path Traversal
            * Manipulate Input to Include Arbitrary Files (e.g., using relative paths in image links or include directives if supported by input format) (-> Read sensitive files on the server)
    * **[High-Risk Path]** Exploit Pandoc's Dependencies **(Critical Node)**
        * **[High-Risk Path]** Vulnerabilities in External Programs (e.g., LaTeX engine, Ghostscript)
            * **[High-Risk Path]** Exploit known vulnerabilities in programs Pandoc relies on for specific conversions (-> Potential for RCE if these dependencies are vulnerable)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Pandoc Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_pandoc_exploitation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category represents attacks that leverage weaknesses in how Pandoc processes input data. Attackers aim to provide specially crafted input that triggers unintended behavior, leading to code execution, data access, or denial of service. This is a critical node because successful exploitation here often has a high impact and can open doors for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Input Format (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_input_format__critical_node_.md)

This involves crafting input in a way that injects executable code, which Pandoc or the receiving application might interpret and execute. This is a critical node as it directly targets code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject HTML/JS in Markdown/RST](./attack_tree_paths/inject_htmljs_in_markdownrst.md)

Attackers embed malicious HTML or JavaScript within Markdown or RST content. If Pandoc's output is directly rendered in a web browser without sanitization, the injected JavaScript can execute in the user's browser (XSS). If the server-side application mishandles this output, it could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject LaTeX Commands](./attack_tree_paths/inject_latex_commands.md)

Attackers inject malicious LaTeX commands within the input. If Pandoc uses LaTeX for output generation (e.g., to PDF) and the LaTeX engine is vulnerable or if the output processing is insecure, these commands could be executed on the server, leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Inclusion/Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_inclusionpath_traversal.md)

Attackers manipulate input (e.g., image links, include directives) to reference files outside the intended directories. If Pandoc or the application doesn't properly sanitize or restrict file access, this can allow attackers to read sensitive files on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pandoc's Dependencies (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pandoc's_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in external programs that Pandoc relies on for certain conversions. This is a critical node because even if Pandoc itself is secure, vulnerable dependencies can be a point of entry.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in External Programs (e.g., LaTeX engine, Ghostscript)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_external_programs__e_g___latex_engine__ghostscript_.md)

Pandoc often relies on external programs like LaTeX engines (pdflatex, xelatex) for PDF generation and Ghostscript for post-processing. If these programs have known vulnerabilities, attackers can craft input that, when processed by Pandoc and these dependencies, triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
