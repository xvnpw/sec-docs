### Key Attack Surface List: RuboCop Integration (High & Critical - RuboCop Specific)

Here are the high and critical attack surface elements that directly involve RuboCop:

* **Configuration File Manipulation (.rubocop.yml):**
    * **Description:**  Attackers could modify the RuboCop configuration file to disable security-relevant checks or introduce malicious custom cops.
    * **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop relies on the `.rubocop.yml` file to define its behavior and which code style rules to enforce.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the repository and modifies `.rubocop.yml` to disable cops that detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Subsequent code changes with SQL injection flaws would not be flagged by RuboCop.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerable code, bypassing security checks, potential for exploitation in production.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store `.rubocop.yml` in version control and treat it as critical infrastructure.
        * Implement code review processes for changes to `.rubocop.yml`.
        * Restrict write access to the repository and the configuration file.
        * Consider using a centrally managed and versioned configuration if managing multiple projects.

* **Introduction of Malicious Custom Cops:**
    * **Description:** Attackers could introduce custom RuboCop cops that execute malicious code during the linting process.
    * **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop allows developers to create custom cops to enforce specific rules or perform custom actions during code analysis.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor contributes a custom cop that, when executed, exfiltrates environment variables or secrets from the developer's machine or the CI/CD environment.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, compromise of developer machines or CI/CD infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review all custom cops before integrating them into the project.
        * Implement code review processes for custom cop development.
        * Restrict the ability to add or modify custom cops to trusted developers.
        * Consider using static analysis tools on custom cop code itself.

* **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:**
    * **Description:**  Compromising the CI/CD environment where RuboCop runs could allow attackers to manipulate the linting process or gain access to build artifacts.
    * **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate code quality checks.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD server and modifies the RuboCop execution command to include malicious scripts or to bypass security checks.
    * **Impact:**  Compromised builds, introduction of vulnerabilities into deployed applications, access to sensitive build artifacts.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the CI/CD environment with strong authentication and authorization.
        * Implement security best practices for CI/CD pipelines, such as least privilege and regular security audits.
        * Verify the integrity of the RuboCop installation and its configuration within the CI/CD environment.
