### High and Critical RuboCop Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving RuboCop.

*   **Threat:** Malicious `.rubocop.yml` Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the repository modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file. They might disable critical security-related cops, configure them to ignore specific vulnerabilities, or introduce rules that enforce insecure practices. This directly leverages RuboCop's configuration mechanism to bypass security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Security vulnerabilities are not detected by RuboCop, leading to the introduction of exploitable code into the application. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading (`.rubocop.yml` parsing and application logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and code review processes for changes to `.rubocop.yml`.
        *   Store `.rubocop.yml` in version control and track changes diligently.
        *   Consider using a configuration linter or validator for `.rubocop.yml` to detect suspicious patterns.
        *   Regularly audit the `.rubocop.yml` configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in RuboCop's Ruby Parser
    *   **Description:** RuboCop relies on a Ruby parser to analyze code. If this parser has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution flaws), an attacker could craft malicious Ruby code that, when analyzed by RuboCop, exploits the parser vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the CI/CD server. This is a direct vulnerability within a core component used by RuboCop.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the developer's environment or the CI/CD pipeline, allowing the attacker to potentially steal credentials, modify code, or deploy malicious software.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ruby Parser (likely a dependency used by RuboCop).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RuboCop updated, as updates will include fixes for vulnerabilities in its dependencies, including the Ruby parser.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the Ruby parser used by RuboCop.
        *   Isolate the environment where RuboCop is executed (e.g., using containers) to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

*   **Threat:** Code Injection through Custom Cops
    *   **Description:** Developers can create custom RuboCop cops. If these custom cops are not carefully written and validated, they could contain vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution when analyzing specific code patterns. An attacker could craft code that triggers this vulnerability in a custom cop, directly exploiting a RuboCop extension mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the CI/CD server, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom RuboCop Cops and their execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes for custom RuboCop cops.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom cops, avoiding constructs that could lead to code injection.
        *   Thoroughly test custom cops in isolated environments before deploying them.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the custom cop code itself.

*   **Threat:** Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Tampering with RuboCop Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised the CI/CD pipeline modifies the RuboCop execution step. They might disable RuboCop entirely, modify its configuration to ignore vulnerabilities, or even replace the legitimate RuboCop executable with a malicious one. This directly targets the integration of RuboCop within the development workflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of vulnerable code without proper static analysis checks, leading to potential security breaches in production.
    *   **Affected Component:** Integration with CI/CD systems (e.g., scripts, plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and implement strong access controls.
        *   Use checksum verification to ensure the integrity of the RuboCop executable used in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Monitor CI/CD pipeline logs for suspicious activity related to RuboCop execution.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for CI/CD accounts.
