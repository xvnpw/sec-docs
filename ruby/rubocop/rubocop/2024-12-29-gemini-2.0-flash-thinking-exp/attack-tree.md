**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Attack: Compromise Application via RuboCop:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and the root of the attack tree. Success at this point means the attacker has achieved their objective through exploiting RuboCop.

*   **Application Uses RuboCop:** This is a fundamental prerequisite. If the application does not use RuboCop, none of the specific threats modeled here are applicable.

*   **Exploit RuboCop Configuration:** This node represents a critical attack vector. Successfully exploiting the RuboCop configuration allows the attacker to manipulate RuboCop's behavior in ways that can lead to code execution or the introduction of vulnerabilities.

*   **Inject Malicious Configuration File (.rubocop.yml):** This is the direct action required to manipulate RuboCop's configuration. Success here allows the attacker to control which checks are performed and potentially introduce malicious custom cops.

*   **Malicious Configuration Leads to Code Execution:** This node signifies the point where the manipulated configuration has a direct and negative impact, either by allowing vulnerable code to pass or by directly executing malicious code through a custom cop.

*   **Exploit RuboCop Custom Cop Functionality:** This node represents a direct attack on RuboCop's extensibility mechanism. Successfully exploiting this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the RuboCop environment.

*   **Introduce Malicious Custom Cop (Directly or via Configuration):** This is the necessary step to enable the execution of malicious code through a custom cop. This can be achieved by directly adding the custom cop file or by defining it within the RuboCop configuration.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Compromise Version Control System (e.g., Git):**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's Git repository. This could be through:
        *   Stolen developer credentials (username/password, API tokens).
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Git server or related infrastructure.
        *   Social engineering to trick a developer into granting access.
    *   Once access is gained, the attacker can directly modify the `.rubocop.yml` file or add malicious custom cop files.

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker gains control over the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline used to build and deploy the application. This could be through:
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
        *   Compromising credentials used by the CI/CD system.
        *   Injecting malicious code into the build process through dependencies or scripts.
    *   Once the pipeline is compromised, the attacker can inject malicious configurations or custom cops during the build process, ensuring they are present when RuboCop is executed.

*   **Disable Security Checks:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file to disable RuboCop rules that are designed to detect potential security vulnerabilities. This is typically done by:
        *   Excluding specific files or directories from analysis.
        *   Disabling individual security-related cops.
        *   Adjusting severity levels to ignore security warnings.
    *   By disabling these checks, the attacker can introduce vulnerable code that would otherwise be flagged by RuboCop, increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation later in the application's lifecycle.

*   **Introduce Malicious Custom Cop:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker introduces a custom RuboCop cop that contains malicious code. This can be done by:
        *   Adding a new Ruby file containing the malicious cop definition to the project's repository.
        *   Defining the custom cop directly within the `.rubocop.yml` file (though less common for complex cops).
    *   The malicious custom cop, when executed by RuboCop, can perform arbitrary actions, such as:
        *   Executing system commands on the build server or developer's machine.
        *   Making network requests to exfiltrate data.
        *   Modifying files on the system.

*   **Malicious Custom Cop Executes Arbitrary Code:**
    *   Attack Vector: Once a malicious custom cop is introduced and RuboCop is executed, the code within the custom cop is run. This allows the attacker to perform any action that the RuboCop process has permissions to execute. This can lead to:
        *   Compromising the build environment.
        *   Exfiltrating sensitive information present in the codebase or environment variables.
        *   Potentially gaining further access to internal systems if the RuboCop execution environment has broader network access.
