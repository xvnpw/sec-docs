# Threat Model Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Threat: [Malicious `.rubocop.yml` Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious___rubocop_yml__configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the repository or development environment and modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file. They might disable crucial security-related cops within RuboCop, configure cops to ignore files containing vulnerabilities that RuboCop would otherwise detect, or introduce custom cops with malicious intent that RuboCop will then execute during analysis.
*   **Impact:** Allows vulnerable code to pass unnoticed by RuboCop, leading to potential security breaches in the deployed application. Malicious custom cops executed by RuboCop could introduce backdoors or exfiltrate data during the analysis process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploiting High Severity Vulnerabilities in RuboCop Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_high_severity_vulnerabilities_in_rubocop_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** RuboCop relies on various Ruby gems. An attacker could exploit known, high severity vulnerabilities in these dependencies if RuboCop is running in an environment accessible to them (e.g., during CI/CD or in a development environment with exposed services). The vulnerability would be within a component that RuboCop directly utilizes.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to remote code execution or significant information disclosure within the environment where RuboCop is running, potentially compromising the codebase or build pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Cop Implementation](./threats/malicious_custom_cop_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to introduce custom cops to RuboCop could create a cop that, when executed by RuboCop during code analysis, performs malicious actions. This could include exfiltrating code snippets that RuboCop is analyzing, injecting backdoors directly into the codebase being processed by RuboCop, or manipulating the build process triggered by RuboCop's analysis.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the codebase through code injection, potential introduction of vulnerabilities that RuboCop itself will not detect, or data exfiltration of the application's source code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
