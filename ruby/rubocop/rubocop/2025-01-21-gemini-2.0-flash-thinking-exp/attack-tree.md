## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to manipulate RuboCop's configuration, which can have a significant impact on the security checks performed. Exploiting configuration vulnerabilities allows attackers to either disable security measures or introduce malicious code directly into the analysis process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify .rubocop.yml to Disable Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__modify__rubocop_yml_to_disable_security_checks.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to the repository and modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file to disable crucial security-related cops. This could involve commenting out or removing rules that check for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or insecure dependencies.
**Impact:** By disabling these checks, the attacker can introduce vulnerable code into the application without RuboCop flagging it, leading to exploitable weaknesses in the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Gain Write Access to Repository/Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__gain_write_access_to_repositoryconfiguration.md)

This critical node represents the attacker achieving the ability to modify the application's codebase and configuration files. This is a fundamental prerequisite for many high-risk attacks related to RuboCop.
**Attack Vectors Leading to This Node:**
*   Compromise Developer Account: An attacker gains access to a legitimate developer's account through methods like phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities on the developer's machine.
*   Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerability: An attacker exploits weaknesses in the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to inject malicious changes or gain control over the deployment process, allowing them to modify repository files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configure Custom Cops with Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__configure_custom_cops_with_malicious_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to the repository and introduces a custom RuboCop cop that contains malicious code. When RuboCop is executed, this custom cop is loaded and its code is executed within the context of the RuboCop process.
**Impact:** This allows for direct code execution during the static analysis phase, potentially enabling the attacker to perform actions like reading sensitive data, modifying files, or even gaining further access to the system running RuboCop.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependencies of RuboCop](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependencies_of_rubocop.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities present in the gems that RuboCop depends on. This can occur in two main ways:
*   Introducing a Vulnerability via Dependency Update: The attacker submits a malicious pull request that updates RuboCop to a version of a dependency known to have vulnerabilities, or even introduces a backdoored dependency.
*   Exploiting an Existing Vulnerability in a Dependency: The attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of RuboCop's dependencies and then triggers a code path within RuboCop that utilizes the vulnerable component in a way that allows exploitation.
**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution within the RuboCop process, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the system or the application being analyzed.
