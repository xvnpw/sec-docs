# Attack Surface Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `.rubocop.yml` Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious___rubocop_yml__configuration.md)

**Description:** A compromised or intentionally malicious `.rubocop.yml` file is introduced into the project.

**How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop reads and enforces the rules defined in this configuration file. If the file is malicious, RuboCop will actively suppress security checks or enforce insecure practices.

**Example:** A malicious `.rubocop.yml` could contain `Security/XSS: Enabled: false`, causing RuboCop to ignore potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Allows insecure code to pass through static analysis, potentially leading to exploitable vulnerabilities in the deployed application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for changes to `.rubocop.yml`.
* Store the `.rubocop.yml` file in a secure location with restricted access.
* Use a version control system and carefully track changes to the configuration file.
* Consider using a baseline or centrally managed RuboCop configuration that is difficult for individual developers to override.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting in Custom Cops](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusiontyposquatting_in_custom_cops.md)

**Description:** The project relies on custom RuboCop cops distributed as gems, and a malicious gem with a similar name is installed instead of the legitimate one.

**How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop loads and executes the code within these custom cops. If a malicious gem is installed, RuboCop will execute the attacker's code.

**Example:** The project intends to use a custom cop gem named `my_project_security_cops`, but a malicious gem named `my-project-security-cops` is installed due to a typo. This malicious gem could contain code to exfiltrate secrets or introduce backdoors.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the development environment, leading to data breaches, supply chain attacks, or compromised developer machines.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully verify the names and sources of custom cop gems before installation.
* Use dependency management tools (like Bundler with lockfiles) to ensure consistent and verified dependencies.
* Implement security scanning for dependencies to detect known vulnerabilities or malicious packages.
* Consider hosting custom cops in a private gem repository with access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Integration](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cicd_pipeline_integration.md)

**Description:** The CI/CD pipeline where RuboCop is executed is compromised.

**How RuboCop Contributes:** If the pipeline is compromised, an attacker can manipulate the execution of RuboCop, either by skipping it entirely, modifying its configuration on the fly, or altering its output to hide warnings.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD system and modifies the pipeline script to comment out the RuboCop execution step or to always report a successful RuboCop run regardless of the actual results.

**Impact:** Allows vulnerable code to be deployed without being flagged by static analysis.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement audit logging for pipeline changes.
* Use secrets management tools to protect credentials used in the pipeline.
* Enforce code signing for pipeline scripts to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Developer Machine Compromise](./attack_surfaces/developer_machine_compromise.md)

**Description:** A developer's machine, where RuboCop is executed locally, is compromised.

**How RuboCop Contributes:** A compromised developer machine allows an attacker to directly manipulate the RuboCop installation, its configuration, or the code being analyzed before it's committed.

**Example:** An attacker installs a malicious RuboCop plugin on a developer's machine that silently disables security checks or injects vulnerabilities into the codebase during analysis.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase, potential for data breaches if sensitive information is accessed on the compromised machine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong endpoint security measures on developer machines (antivirus, firewalls, endpoint detection and response).
* Provide security awareness training to developers to prevent phishing and malware infections.
* Implement regular security audits of developer machines.
* Consider using containerized development environments to isolate projects and limit the impact of a compromise.
