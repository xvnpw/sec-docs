*   **A. Manipulate RuboCop Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  RuboCop's effectiveness hinges on its configuration. Manipulating it directly weakens the security checks intended to protect the application. This path is critical because it directly undermines the security benefits of using RuboCop.

## Attack Tree Path: [A.1. Direct Modification of .rubocop.yml](./attack_tree_paths/a_1__direct_modification_of__rubocop_yml.md)

*   **A.1. Direct Modification of `.rubocop.yml` (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Directly altering the configuration file is the most straightforward way to disable or weaken RuboCop's rules. This is a critical node as it's a direct and impactful attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [A.1.a. Compromise Repository Access](./attack_tree_paths/a_1_a__compromise_repository_access.md)

*   **A.1.a. Compromise Repository Access (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Gaining access to the application's repository is a highly impactful compromise. It allows attackers to modify not only the RuboCop configuration but also the application code itself. This is a critical node because repository access is a gateway to numerous attack possibilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [A.1.a.i. Exploit Weak Repository Security (e.g., stolen credentials, misconfiguration)](./attack_tree_paths/a_1_a_i__exploit_weak_repository_security__e_g___stolen_credentials__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **A.1.a.i. Exploit Weak Repository Security (e.g., stolen credentials, misconfiguration) (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Exploiting weak repository security is a common and often successful attack vector. Weak passwords, exposed API keys, and misconfigured permissions are frequently found in real-world scenarios. The likelihood is medium-high, and the impact is critical, making this a significant high-risk path. Attackers with beginner to intermediate skills can often achieve this with relatively low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [B. Exploit RuboCop's Code Analysis Logic](./attack_tree_paths/b__exploit_rubocop's_code_analysis_logic.md)

*   **B. Exploit RuboCop's Code Analysis Logic (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Static analysis tools like RuboCop are not perfect and have inherent limitations. Attackers can exploit these limitations to introduce vulnerabilities that RuboCop fails to detect. This path is high-risk because it allows vulnerabilities to bypass automated checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [B.1. Input Manipulation to Bypass Checks](./attack_tree_paths/b_1__input_manipulation_to_bypass_checks.md)

*   **B.1. Input Manipulation to Bypass Checks (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Attackers actively try to bypass security controls. Input manipulation, specifically crafting code to evade detection, is a common tactic. This path is high-risk because it directly targets the effectiveness of RuboCop's analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [B.1.a. Craft Code that Evades RuboCop Detection](./attack_tree_paths/b_1_a__craft_code_that_evades_rubocop_detection.md)

*   **B.1.a. Craft Code that Evades RuboCop Detection (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Attackers can use various techniques to obfuscate code or exploit the specific limitations of RuboCop's rules. This path is high-risk because it directly undermines the intended security benefits of static analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [B.1.a.i. Obfuscate Vulnerable Code to Appear Compliant](./attack_tree_paths/b_1_a_i__obfuscate_vulnerable_code_to_appear_compliant.md)

*   **B.1.a.i. Obfuscate Vulnerable Code to Appear Compliant (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Code obfuscation techniques are readily available and relatively easy to apply. Attackers can use them to hide malicious code or vulnerabilities in a way that makes the code appear compliant to RuboCop's rules. This path is high-risk due to its medium likelihood and potential to introduce vulnerabilities that bypass static analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [B.1.a.ii. Exploit Limitations in RuboCop's Static Analysis (e.g., complex logic, dynamic code)](./attack_tree_paths/b_1_a_ii__exploit_limitations_in_rubocop's_static_analysis__e_g___complex_logic__dynamic_code_.md)

*   **B.1.a.ii. Exploit Limitations in RuboCop's Static Analysis (e.g., complex logic, dynamic code) (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Static analysis tools struggle with complex logic, dynamic code generation, and certain types of vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these inherent limitations to introduce vulnerabilities that RuboCop is not designed to detect. This path is high-risk because it leverages fundamental weaknesses in static analysis, leading to a medium-high likelihood of success in bypassing checks for certain types of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [D. Abuse RuboCop's Integration in Development Workflow](./attack_tree_paths/d__abuse_rubocop's_integration_in_development_workflow.md)

*   **D. Abuse RuboCop's Integration in Development Workflow (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Why High-Risk:** RuboCop is often integrated into critical parts of the development workflow, such as CI/CD pipelines and developer environments. Abusing these integration points can bypass security checks or compromise development resources. This path is critical because it targets the workflow designed to ensure code quality and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.1. Exploit CI/CD Integration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/d_1__exploit_cicd_integration_weaknesses.md)

*   **D.1. Exploit CI/CD Integration Weaknesses (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** CI/CD pipelines are crucial for automated builds and deployments. Weaknesses in their configuration or security can allow attackers to bypass security checks or inject malicious code into the build process. This is a critical node because CI/CD is a central point in the development lifecycle.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.1.a. Manipulate CI/CD Pipeline to Skip RuboCop Checks](./attack_tree_paths/d_1_a__manipulate_cicd_pipeline_to_skip_rubocop_checks.md)

*   **D.1.a. Manipulate CI/CD Pipeline to Skip RuboCop Checks (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  If attackers can manipulate the CI/CD pipeline to skip RuboCop checks, they can effectively disable this security gate in the development process. This is a critical node because it directly bypasses an intended security control.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.1.a.i. Compromise CI/CD Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/d_1_a_i__compromise_cicd_configuration.md)

*   **D.1.a.i. Compromise CI/CD Configuration (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** CI/CD configurations can be complex and sometimes lack robust security controls. Compromising these configurations is a viable attack vector to manipulate the pipeline, including skipping RuboCop checks. This path is high-risk due to its potential to directly disable security checks in the automated pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.2. Exploit Developer's Local Environment](./attack_tree_paths/d_2__exploit_developer's_local_environment.md)

*   **D.2. Exploit Developer's Local Environment (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Developer environments often contain sensitive information and access to internal systems. Compromising a developer's machine can provide attackers with broad access and the ability to manipulate code and configurations. This is a critical node because developer environments are often a weaker security perimeter compared to production systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.2.a. Compromise Developer Machine](./attack_tree_paths/d_2_a__compromise_developer_machine.md)

*   **D.2.a. Compromise Developer Machine (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Compromising a developer's machine is a highly effective way to gain access to development resources and potentially inject malicious code. This is a critical node as it represents a direct breach into the development environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [D.2.a.i. Phishing/Malware to Gain Access to Developer Environment](./attack_tree_paths/d_2_a_i__phishingmalware_to_gain_access_to_developer_environment.md)

*   **D.2.a.i. Phishing/Malware to Gain Access to Developer Environment (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Phishing and malware are common and still highly effective attack vectors. Targeting developers with phishing emails or malware can provide attackers with access to their machines and, consequently, the development environment. This path is high-risk due to its medium-high likelihood and critical impact, as compromising a developer machine can lead to significant breaches.
