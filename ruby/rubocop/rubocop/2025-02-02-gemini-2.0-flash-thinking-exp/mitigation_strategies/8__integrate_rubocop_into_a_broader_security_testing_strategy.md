**4.5. Penetration Testing:**

*   **Description:** "Perform regular penetration testing (both automated and manual) on the application in staging and production environments to identify runtime vulnerabilities."
*   **Analysis:**  Penetration testing (pentesting) simulates real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities in a live environment. It complements SAST and DAST by focusing on runtime vulnerabilities and configuration issues that might not be detectable through static analysis or application scanning alone.  Regular pentesting is crucial for validating the effectiveness of security controls and identifying weaknesses in the deployed application.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Real-World Vulnerability Assessment:**  Provides a realistic assessment of the application's security posture from an attacker's perspective.
    *   **Runtime Vulnerability Detection:**  Identifies vulnerabilities that only manifest in a running environment, such as server misconfigurations, environment-specific issues, and vulnerabilities in third-party libraries at runtime.
    *   **Validation of Security Controls:**  Verifies the effectiveness of implemented security controls and identifies gaps in defenses.
    *   **Compliance Requirements:**  Often required for compliance with security standards and regulations.
*   **Challenges:**
