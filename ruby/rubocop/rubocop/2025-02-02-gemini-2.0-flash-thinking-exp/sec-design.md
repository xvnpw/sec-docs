# BUSINESS POSTURE

RuboCop is a static code analyzer for the Ruby programming language. Its primary business goal is to improve the quality, consistency, and style of Ruby codebases. By automating code style checks and identifying potential code defects, RuboCop helps developers write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone code.

Business priorities for adopting RuboCop include:
- Enforcing consistent coding style across projects and teams.
- Reducing code review time by automating style checks.
- Improving code readability and maintainability.
- Identifying potential code quality issues early in the development lifecycle.
- Onboarding new developers faster by providing clear coding guidelines.

Most important business risks associated with RuboCop:
- Incorrect or overly strict style rules hindering developer productivity.
- False positives or negatives in code analysis leading to wasted effort or missed defects.
- Performance overhead of running RuboCop checks, especially in large projects or CI/CD pipelines.
- Dependency vulnerabilities within RuboCop or its plugins.
- Misconfiguration of RuboCop leading to ineffective or counterproductive code analysis.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: GitHub repository access control to manage who can contribute to RuboCop project. Implemented in GitHub repository settings.
- security control: Code review process for pull requests to ensure code quality and security. Implemented via GitHub pull request workflow.
- security control: Automated testing to verify the functionality of RuboCop and prevent regressions. Implemented via GitHub Actions.
- accepted risk: Public accessibility of the RuboCop codebase as it is an open-source project.
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party Ruby gems and libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in RuboCop's dependencies.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools to scan RuboCop's codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement a secure build pipeline to ensure the integrity and provenance of RuboCop releases.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to RuboCop as an end-user tool. Authentication is relevant for contributors to the RuboCop project, managed by GitHub.
- Authorization: Authorization is relevant for contributors to the RuboCop project, managed by GitHub's role-based access control. For end-users, authorization is about configuring which checks RuboCop performs, controlled by configuration files.
- Input validation: RuboCop needs to validate its configuration files (e.g., `.rubocop.yml`) to prevent malicious configurations from causing unexpected behavior or security issues. Input validation should be applied to rule definitions and user-provided code to prevent code injection vulnerabilities if RuboCop were to execute user code (though this is not its primary function).
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for RuboCop's functionality. However, if RuboCop were to handle sensitive data in the future (e.g., storing configuration in a secure vault), cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, it's not a primary security requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Ensuring the integrity and availability of the RuboCop tool itself, as it is relied upon by developers to improve code quality.
- Protecting the reputation of the RuboCop project and maintainers.
- Ensuring that RuboCop does not introduce vulnerabilities into the codebases it analyzes (though this is less direct, the tool should be reliable and not misleading).

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- RuboCop codebase: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are important. Sensitivity: Medium (public but needs to be trustworthy).
- RuboCop configuration files: Can contain project-specific settings, but generally not highly sensitive. Sensitivity: Low.
- Ruby code analyzed by RuboCop: Sensitivity depends on the project being analyzed. RuboCop itself does not store or transmit this code, but its analysis results could indirectly reveal information about the code. Sensitivity: Low to High (depending on the analyzed code, but RuboCop itself doesn't directly handle sensitive data).
- Build artifacts (RuboCop gem): Integrity and provenance are important to ensure users are downloading a legitimate and safe tool. Sensitivity: Medium (needs to be trustworthy).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: What is the primary context where this design document will be used? Is it for internal use of RuboCop within an organization, or for understanding the security of the open-source RuboCop project itself? What are the specific code quality and security goals for projects using RuboCop?
- SECURITY POSTURE: What existing security tools and processes are already in place for Ruby development in the target environment? What is the organization's risk tolerance regarding open-source dependencies and code analysis tools? Are there any specific compliance requirements that RuboCop needs to help address?
- DESIGN: Are there any specific integrations with other tools or systems that are important to consider for RuboCop's deployment and usage? Are there any performance or scalability requirements for RuboCop in the target environment?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to use RuboCop to improve code quality and consistency in Ruby projects, leading to better maintainability and reduced defects. Security is a secondary but important consideration, focusing on ensuring RuboCop itself is secure and doesn't introduce new risks.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The organization using this design document values secure software development practices and is concerned about supply chain security risks associated with open-source dependencies. They are looking for recommendations to enhance the security posture of RuboCop usage and its development lifecycle.
- DESIGN: RuboCop is primarily used as a command-line tool, integrated into developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines. Deployment is via RubyGems, and the build process is automated using GitHub Actions. The focus is on the core functionality of RuboCop as a static code analyzer and formatter.
