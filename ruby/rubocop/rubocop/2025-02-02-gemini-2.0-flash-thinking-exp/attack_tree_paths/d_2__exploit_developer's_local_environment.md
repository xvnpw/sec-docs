Physical security of office buildings beyond individual workstations is also outside the scope.

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Information Gathering:** Review existing documentation on developer environment security best practices, common attack vectors, and relevant security frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, OWASP).
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Employ threat modeling techniques to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to developer environments in the context of a RuboCop project. This will involve brainstorming sessions and utilizing frameworks like STRIDE or PASTA (though less formal application is sufficient for this analysis).
3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  For each identified attack vector, we will detail the steps an attacker might take, the tools they might use, and the potential entry points into a developer's local environment.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will evaluate the potential impact of each successful attack vector, considering both technical and business consequences. We will use a risk-based approach, considering likelihood and severity.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Based on the identified attack vectors and impact assessment, we will develop a comprehensive set of mitigation strategies. These strategies will be categorized as preventative (reducing the likelihood of attack) and detective (improving detection and response capabilities).
6.  **RuboCop Contextualization:** We will specifically analyze how the use of RuboCop might be affected by a compromised developer environment and how RuboCop itself can be leveraged (or potentially misused) in such scenarios.
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  The findings of this analysis will be documented in a clear and structured markdown format, including actionable recommendations for the development team.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: D.2. Exploit Developer's Local Environment

**D.2. Exploit Developer's Local Environment (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

*   **Why High-Risk:** Developer environments often contain sensitive information and access to internal systems. Compromising a developer's machine can provide attackers with broad access and the ability to manipulate code and configurations. This is a critical node because developer environments are often a weaker security perimeter compared to production systems.

**Detailed Breakdown and Attack Vectors:**

This attack path focuses on compromising the individual workstations and accounts of developers working on the RuboCop project.  The attacker's goal is to gain control over a developer's machine to achieve various malicious objectives. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors:

**4.1. Social Engineering & Phishing:**
