**A.1.a. Compromise Repository Access (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

*   **Why High-Risk:** Gaining access to the application's repository is a highly impactful compromise. It allows attackers to modify not only the RuboCop configuration but also the application code itself. This is a critical node because repository access is a gateway to numerous attack possibilities.

**Detailed Breakdown and Attack Vectors:**

Compromising repository access can be achieved through various attack vectors targeting different aspects of the repository access control and infrastructure.  Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors:

**4.1. Credential Compromise:**

*   **4.1.a. Phishing Attacks:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers could target developers or administrators with phishing emails or messages designed to steal their repository access credentials (usernames and passwords, API keys, SSH keys). These emails might mimic legitimate login pages or request urgent action.
    *   **Impact:** Direct access to the repository using compromised credentials.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and administrators about phishing techniques and how to identify suspicious emails and links.
