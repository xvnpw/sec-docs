# Attack Surface Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Attack Surface: [Ruby Code Execution via Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/ruby_code_execution_via_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** RuboCop allows including Ruby code in configuration files, primarily through `require` statements for custom cops or formatters. This enables execution of arbitrary Ruby code within the RuboCop process.
*   **RuboCop Contribution:** This feature, designed for extensibility, directly enables the execution of arbitrary Ruby code within the RuboCop process through configuration.
*   **Example:** A compromised repository contains a `.rubocop.yml` file with `require './malicious_cop.rb'`. When a developer runs RuboCop, `malicious_cop.rb` (containing malicious code) is executed, potentially exfiltrating secrets or compromising the system.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Data Exfiltration, System Compromise (depending on permissions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/RuboCop Maintainers:**
        *   Clearly document the severe risks of including arbitrary Ruby code in configuration.
        *   Consider adding prominent warnings when `require` statements are encountered in configuration (though this might impact legitimate use cases).
        *   Explore robust sandboxing or isolation mechanisms for required files to limit potential damage (complex and might restrict functionality).
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Exercise extreme caution and treat `.rubocop.yml` files as executable code**, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   **Thoroughly review `.rubocop.yml` files** for unexpected `require` statements or any other suspicious Ruby code before running RuboCop, particularly in automated environments like CI/CD pipelines.
        *   **Run RuboCop under the principle of least privilege.** Limit the permissions of the user account running RuboCop to minimize the potential impact of code execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Security of Third-Party Custom Cops and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/security_of_third-party_custom_cops_and_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  RuboCop's extensibility relies on custom cops and plugins, which are often developed by third parties. These external components may contain vulnerabilities or even intentionally malicious code.
*   **RuboCop Contribution:**  RuboCop's plugin architecture directly introduces the risk associated with integrating and executing third-party code within its process.
*   **Example:** A user installs a seemingly helpful custom cop from an untrusted source. This cop, however, contains malicious code that, when RuboCop is executed, steals sensitive environment variables, injects backdoors into the analyzed project, or performs other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Data Exfiltration, System Compromise, Supply Chain Attack, Backdoor Installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/RuboCop Maintainers:**
        *   While direct control is limited, strongly emphasize the security risks associated with using untrusted third-party code within the RuboCop community.
        *   Promote and document best practices for developing secure custom cops and for auditing third-party cops.
        *   Consider establishing a community-driven initiative to vet and curate a list of trusted and security-reviewed custom cops and plugins.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Exercise extreme caution and treat third-party custom cops and plugins as potentially untrusted code.**
        *   **Thoroughly vet, audit, and review the source code of custom cops** before installation and use, especially those from unknown or unverified sources.  Focus on understanding what the cop does and if it performs any unexpected actions.
        *   Prefer using well-established, widely adopted, and community-vetted custom cop libraries with a proven track record and active maintenance.
        *   Implement robust dependency management practices to carefully track and manage the sources and versions of all custom cops used in your projects. Regularly check for updates and security advisories related to these dependencies.
