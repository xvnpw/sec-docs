# Threat Model Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Threat: [Permissive Configuration Exploitation](./threats/permissive_configuration_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with access to the codebase, modifies the `.rubocop.yml` configuration to disable security-relevant cops. This allows them to introduce code with known vulnerabilities without RuboCop flagging them during development or CI.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of exploitable vulnerabilities into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** Configuration (`.rubocop.yml` file, configuration loading mechanism)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control to the `.rubocop.yml` file.
        *   Enforce code review for all changes to the RuboCop configuration.
        *   Store the configuration in a secure, version-controlled repository.
        *   Regularly audit the configuration to ensure security cops are enabled.
        *   Use configuration management tools to enforce consistent configurations.

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Cop Introduction](./threats/malicious_custom_cop_introduction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or a compromised developer account, introduces a malicious custom RuboCop cop into the project. This cop could be designed to bypass security checks, or exfiltrate sensitive data from the development environment during code analysis.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security checks, potential introduction of backdoors, or data exfiltration from the development environment.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** Custom Cop Loading, Cop Execution
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review for all custom cops.
        *   Restrict the development and deployment of custom cops to trusted developers.
        *   Use static analysis tools to analyze custom cop code for potential vulnerabilities or malicious logic.
        *   Avoid sourcing custom cops from untrusted external sources.
        *   Implement a process for vetting and approving custom cops before deployment.

## Threat: [Compromised RuboCop Gem Distribution (Supply Chain)](./threats/compromised_rubocop_gem_distribution__supply_chain_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker compromises the RuboCop gem on RubyGems.org or a mirror. Developers downloading this compromised gem would unknowingly install a malicious version. This malicious gem could then introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code into their projects during development or build processes.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of projects using RuboCop if a malicious gem is distributed, potentially leading to backdoors, data breaches, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** Gem Distribution (RubyGems.org), Gem Installation Process
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency checksum verification (e.g., `Gemfile.lock`) to ensure gem integrity.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to RubyGems.org and the Ruby ecosystem.
        *   Consider using private gem repositories or gem mirroring to control the source of gems.
        *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Practice general supply chain security principles.
