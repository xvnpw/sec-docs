# Threat Model Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Cop Implementation](./threats/malicious_custom_cop_implementation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with the ability to contribute or modify custom RuboCop cops introduces malicious logic within the cop's code. This could involve injecting backdoors, exfiltrating data during analysis, or manipulating the analysis process to ignore vulnerabilities. This might happen through a compromised developer account or a vulnerability in the custom cop development workflow.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution during RuboCop analysis, sensitive data leakage from the codebase or environment, or the intentional overlooking of security flaws.

**Affected Component:** Custom Cops (Ruby code within the `rubocop/cop/` directory or included from external gems)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for all custom RuboCop cops.
* Scan custom cops with static analysis tools for potential vulnerabilities.
* Limit the use of custom cops to essential project-specific needs.
* Ensure custom cops are developed by trusted individuals or teams.
* Isolate the environment where custom cops are executed during development and testing.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in RuboCop Core](./threats/vulnerability_in_rubocop_core.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the core RuboCop gem itself. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability if they can influence the environment where RuboCop is executed (e.g., a CI/CD pipeline) or provide crafted input that triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD server, leading to further system compromise or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** RuboCop Core (Ruby code within the main RuboCop gem)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update RuboCop to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories for RuboCop and its dependencies.
* Isolate the environment where RuboCop is executed to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** RuboCop relies on various other Ruby gems as dependencies. A vulnerability in one of these dependencies could be exploited indirectly through RuboCop if the attacker can control the environment or influence RuboCop's execution.

**Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in RuboCop itself, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Dependencies (Ruby gems listed in RuboCop's `Gemfile`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update RuboCop and its dependencies using tools like `bundle update`.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
* Consider using a private gem mirror to control the versions of dependencies used.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on RuboCop Package](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_rubocop_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official RuboCop gem on a package repository (like RubyGems.org) and injects malicious code into it. Developers unknowingly download and execute this compromised version.

**Impact:**  Widespread compromise of development environments, potentially leading to the injection of malicious code into applications or the theft of sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** RuboCop Package (distributed via package repositories)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use trusted package repositories and verify package integrity (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
* Employ software composition analysis tools to detect known vulnerabilities and potentially malicious packages.
* Consider using a private gem mirror for greater control over the source of dependencies.
