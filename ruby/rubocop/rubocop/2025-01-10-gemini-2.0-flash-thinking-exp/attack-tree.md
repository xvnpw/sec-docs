## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RuboCop [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rubocop__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application by leveraging weaknesses within RuboCop's usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RuboCop's Code Analysis Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rubocop's_code_analysis_process__critical_node_.md)

This node represents attacks that directly manipulate or abuse RuboCop's core function of analyzing code. Attackers aim to inject malicious code or trigger vulnerabilities during this process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via RuboCop's Auto-Correction [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_rubocop's_auto-correction__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on the risk associated with RuboCop's auto-correction feature. Attackers craft specific Ruby code that, when automatically corrected by RuboCop, introduces security vulnerabilities into the codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Ruby Code that, when Auto-Corrected, Introduces Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_ruby_code_that__when_auto-corrected__introduces_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is the critical step within the auto-correction attack path. The attacker needs to possess the skill and knowledge to create Ruby code that will be transformed into vulnerable code by RuboCop's auto-correction rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Example: Introduce XSS by modifying string interpolation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/example_introduce_xss_by_modifying_string_interpolation__high_risk_path_.md)

A concrete example of how malicious code can be injected via auto-correction. An attacker might craft code where RuboCop's attempt to simplify string concatenation inadvertently introduces a path for unescaped user input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RuboCop's Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rubocop's_configuration__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with manipulating RuboCop's configuration. Attackers can weaken or disable security checks by modifying the `.rubocop.yml` file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Configuration through `.rubocop.yml` [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_configuration_through___rubocop_yml___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This is the direct action of modifying the configuration file to introduce malicious settings. This could involve disabling important security cops or configuring them to ignore vulnerable patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Security-Relevant Cops [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security-relevant_cops__high_risk_path_.md)

A specific and impactful way to introduce malicious configuration. By disabling cops that are designed to detect security vulnerabilities, attackers can allow vulnerable code to pass through the static analysis process undetected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RuboCop's Execution Environment [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rubocop's_execution_environment__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attacks that target the environment in which RuboCop is executed, often the CI/CD pipeline. Compromising this environment can have significant consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the CI/CD Pipeline Running RuboCop [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_cicd_pipeline_running_rubocop__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node within the execution environment attack path. If an attacker can compromise the CI/CD pipeline where RuboCop is running, they can potentially inject malicious code, alter the build process, or gain access to sensitive credentials.
