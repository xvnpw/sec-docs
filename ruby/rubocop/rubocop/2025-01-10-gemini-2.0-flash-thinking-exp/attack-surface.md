# Attack Surface Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Cops or Formatters](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_cops_or_formatters.md)

*   **Description:**  RuboCop allows for the use of custom cops and formatters, which are essentially Ruby code extending its functionality. If these custom components are malicious, they can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop loads and executes the code within these custom cops and formatters. This provides a direct avenue for executing arbitrary code within the RuboCop process.
    *   **Example:** A malicious custom cop contains code that executes arbitrary system commands (e.g., `system("rm -rf /")`), reads sensitive files from the server, or injects malicious code into the analyzed codebase when RuboCop is run.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running RuboCop, potentially leading to data breaches, full system compromise, or modification of the codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly control the sources of custom cops and formatters.** Only use components from highly trusted and reputable sources.
        *   **Mandatory code review for all custom cops and formatters.**  Thoroughly examine the code for any malicious or insecure logic before integration.
        *   **Implement static analysis on custom cop code.** Use tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the custom components.
        *   **Run RuboCop with custom cops in a sandboxed environment with the least necessary privileges.** This can limit the impact if a malicious cop is executed.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (when directly exploitable through RuboCop)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__when_directly_exploitable_through_rubocop_.md)

*   **Description:** RuboCop relies on various Ruby gems as dependencies. If a dependency has a critical vulnerability, and RuboCop directly utilizes the vulnerable functionality, it presents a high or critical risk.
    *   **How RuboCop Contributes:**  RuboCop's codebase integrates and uses the functionalities provided by its dependencies. If a dependency has a severe vulnerability that RuboCop's code directly interacts with, it becomes exploitable through RuboCop.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in a parsing library used by RuboCop for processing certain file types allows for remote code execution. If RuboCop uses this vulnerable parsing functionality, an attacker could potentially exploit it by providing specially crafted input.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running RuboCop, potentially allowing for data breaches or full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability and its exploitability through RuboCop)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize keeping RuboCop and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.**  This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement automated dependency scanning and vulnerability alerts.** Tools like `bundler-audit` or commercial solutions can identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Regularly review RuboCop's Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.** Understand the dependencies and their potential risks.
        *   **Consider pinning dependency versions** to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce new vulnerabilities, but ensure a process for regularly reviewing and updating these pinned versions.
