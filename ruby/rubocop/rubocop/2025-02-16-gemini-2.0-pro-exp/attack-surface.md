# Attack Surface Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Attack Surface: [1. Insecure Code Due to Disabled/Misconfigured Cops](./attack_surfaces/1__insecure_code_due_to_disabledmisconfigured_cops.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities are introduced or remain undetected because security-relevant RuboCop cops (rules) are disabled, misconfigured, or ignored. This is the most direct and significant risk.
    *   **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop's core purpose is to enforce coding standards, including security best practices.  Disabling, misconfiguring, or ignoring security-related cops directly negates this purpose and allows vulnerable code to pass through.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The `Security/Eval` cop is disabled, allowing `eval` to be used with unsanitized user input, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   The `Rails/FilePath` cop is disabled, and the application uses unsanitized user input to construct file paths, resulting in a Path Traversal vulnerability.
        *   A cop that detects hardcoded secrets is disabled or its threshold is set too high, allowing API keys or passwords to be committed to the codebase.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from significant data breaches to complete system compromise, depending on the specific vulnerability allowed by the disabled/misconfigured cop.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical** to **High** (severity depends on the specific cop and the context of its use).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Configuration Management:**  Treat the `.rubocop.yml` file (and any other configuration sources) as a security-critical configuration file.  Use version control, code review, and automated checks (e.g., YAML linters) to ensure its integrity and correctness.  *Never* commit a `.rubocop.yml` with disabled security cops without *extremely* strong justification and review.
        *   **Automated Enforcement:**  Integrate RuboCop into the CI/CD pipeline.  Fail builds *immediately* if any security-related cops are violated.  Prevent merging of any code that contains violations.  This is a *non-negotiable* security practice.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly) review the RuboCop configuration to ensure that *all* relevant security cops are enabled and appropriately configured.  Update the configuration as new RuboCop versions and security best practices are released.
        *   **`rubocop:disable` Comment Review:**  Implement a *strict* policy requiring detailed justification and peer review for *every* `rubocop:disable` comment, *especially* those related to security cops.  Use automated tools to track, audit, and flag these comments.  Consider a policy that *prohibits* disabling certain critical security cops under any circumstances.
        *   **Prioritize Security Cops:**  Clearly identify and prioritize security-related cops in the configuration and in developer documentation.  Ensure developers understand the implications of disabling these cops.

## Attack Surface: [2. Introduction of Vulnerabilities via Custom Cops](./attack_surfaces/2__introduction_of_vulnerabilities_via_custom_cops.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly written custom RuboCop cops introduce new vulnerabilities or, more commonly, fail to detect existing ones (false negatives).
    *   **How RuboCop Contributes:** RuboCop's extensibility allows developers to create custom cops.  If these custom cops are flawed, they can directly compromise the security of the codebase by either introducing new issues or masking existing ones.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A custom cop intended to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities contains a logic error that causes it to miss certain injection patterns, leaving the application vulnerable.
        *   A custom cop designed to enforce secure password handling has a bug that allows weak passwords to be used.
        *   A custom cop, due to a flaw in its implementation, incorrectly flags secure code as insecure, leading developers to make unnecessary and potentially *harmful* changes to "fix" the (non-existent) issue.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from missed vulnerabilities (false negatives) to the *active introduction* of new vulnerabilities.  Performance degradation of the development environment is also a concern if the custom cop is poorly optimized.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rigorous Code Review:**  Subject custom cops to *extremely* thorough code review, with a strong emphasis on security, correctness, and performance.  Involve security experts in the review process.  This is *crucial*.
        *   **Extensive Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for *all* custom cops.  Test for both positive cases (detecting vulnerabilities) and negative cases (avoiding false positives).  Include test cases that specifically target potential security flaws in the cop's logic.
        *   **Documentation:**  Clearly and thoroughly document the purpose, behavior, limitations, and *assumptions* of each custom cop.  This documentation should be reviewed as part of the code review process.
