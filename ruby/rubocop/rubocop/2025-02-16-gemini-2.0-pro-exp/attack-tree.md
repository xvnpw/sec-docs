## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit RuboCop Configuration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_rubocop_configuration__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk entry point. The attacker aims to manipulate RuboCop's configuration to their advantage, ultimately leading to code execution. This is considered critical because it offers a direct path to the attacker's goal with potentially lower effort compared to exploiting vulnerabilities in the codebase or dependencies.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Configuration files are often overlooked in security assessments, and developers might not realize the full extent of control they offer over RuboCop's behavior. Misconfigurations are relatively common.
*   **Why Critical:** A compromised configuration can directly enable malicious actions, such as disabling security checks or running arbitrary code through custom cops or extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Malicious Config File]]](./attack_tree_paths/__malicious_config_file__.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the attacker successfully introducing a malicious configuration file. This file contains settings that instruct RuboCop to perform actions that benefit the attacker.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The impact is very high, as a malicious configuration can completely control RuboCop's behavior.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the direct enabler of code execution through configuration manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Remote Config File Inclusion]](./attack_tree_paths/_remote_config_file_inclusion_.md)

*   **Description:** RuboCop is configured to load its configuration from a remote URL (e.g., using the `--config` flag with a URL). This is a highly dangerous practice.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for an attacker. They don't need to compromise the local filesystem; they just need to control the content served at the specified URL.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies that RuboCop is configured to load from a remote URL.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious `.rubocop.yml` file.
    *   The attacker hosts the malicious file on a server they control.
    *   The attacker ensures that RuboCop loads the configuration from their malicious URL (e.g., by influencing a CI/CD pipeline, social engineering, or exploiting another vulnerability that allows them to modify the RuboCop command-line arguments).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Craft URL to malicious YAML]]](./attack_tree_paths/__craft_url_to_malicious_yaml__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical action within the remote file inclusion attack. The attacker creates a URL pointing to their controlled server hosting the malicious `.rubocop.yml` file.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the final step in the remote configuration attack, directly leading to the loading of the malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Local Config File Inclusion]](./attack_tree_paths/_local_config_file_inclusion_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the filesystem and modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file (or other configuration files that RuboCop reads).
*   **Why High-Risk:** While it requires an initial compromise (e.g., another vulnerability to gain filesystem access), the impact is very high, granting full control over RuboCop.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker exploits a separate vulnerability (e.g., directory traversal, file upload, RCE) to gain write access to the filesystem.
    *   The attacker locates the `.rubocop.yml` file (or other relevant configuration files).
    *   The attacker modifies the file, injecting malicious configurations.
    *   The attacker waits for RuboCop to be executed, triggering the malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Place file on filesystem]]](./attack_tree_paths/__place_file_on_filesystem__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical action within the local file inclusion attack. The attacker successfully places or modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file on the target system.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the final step in the local configuration attack, directly leading to the loading of the malicious configuration.
