# Threat Model Analysis for rubocop/rubocop

## Threat: [T1: Configuration Weakening for Vulnerability Introduction](./threats/t1_configuration_weakening_for_vulnerability_introduction.md)

*   **Threat:** T1: Configuration Weakening for Vulnerability Introduction

    *   **Description:** A malicious insider or attacker with compromised credentials modifies the `.rubocop.yml` file (or equivalent configuration files). They disable security-related cops (e.g., `Security/Eval`, `Security/YAMLLoad`, `Security/Open`) or reduce their severity/thresholds. They might also change configurations to allow insecure coding practices. The attacker commits these changes to the repository.
    *   **Impact:** Security checks are bypassed, allowing vulnerable code to be merged and deployed. This significantly increases the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities in the production application.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** `.rubocop.yml` (configuration file), specifically the configuration of individual cops, particularly those within the `Security` department and other cops related to code style and complexity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, multi-person code reviews for *any* changes to `.rubocop.yml`, with a focus on security-related cops.
        *   **Configuration Protection:** Store a "golden copy" of the security-critical RuboCop configuration in a separate, highly restricted repository. Use a CI/CD process to compare the project's `.rubocop.yml` against this golden copy and fail the build if there are unauthorized deviations.
        *   **Change Auditing:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) on `.rubocop.yml` to detect and alert on any unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Centralized Configuration:** Use a centralized configuration management system to enforce consistent and secure RuboCop configurations.

## Threat: [T2: Malicious Third-Party Extension](./threats/t2_malicious_third-party_extension.md)

*   **Threat:** T2: Malicious Third-Party Extension

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious RuboCop extension (gem) to a public repository. A developer, unaware of the malicious nature, installs this extension. The extension could contain code that injects vulnerabilities, steals sensitive information, modifies the codebase to introduce backdoors, or disables security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the development environment, introduction of vulnerabilities and backdoors into the application, data exfiltration.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** RuboCop's extension loading mechanism (via `require` and gem dependencies), specifically the interaction with external gems. The malicious code could reside within any part of the extension (cops, formatters, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Extension Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all third-party extensions before installation. Examine the source code, check the author's reputation, and look for signs of malicious activity.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a dependency vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in RuboCop extensions and their dependencies.
        *   **Version Pinning:** Pin the versions of all RuboCop extensions and their dependencies in the `Gemfile` to prevent automatic updates to potentially malicious versions. Use precise versioning.
        *   **Private Gem Server:** Consider using a private gem server to host only approved and vetted RuboCop extensions.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run RuboCop with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [T6: Inline Disabling Bypass](./threats/t6_inline_disabling_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** T6: Inline Disabling Bypass

    *   **Description:** Developers use inline comments (`# rubocop:disable CopName`, `# rubocop:disable all`) to bypass specific RuboCop rules, including security-related ones, without proper justification or review. They might do this to quickly fix a linting error without addressing the underlying issue, or to intentionally bypass a security check.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities by circumventing security checks. Code that violates security best practices is allowed to be merged and deployed.
    *   **RuboCop Component Affected:** RuboCop's comment parsing and disabling mechanism, specifically the handling of `# rubocop:disable` directives.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Inline Disables:** Configure RuboCop to either completely disallow inline disabling (`--no-disable-comments`) or to severely restrict its use.
        *   **Justification Requirement:** Use a custom RuboCop cop or a separate tool to enforce that all inline disable comments include a detailed justification.
        *   **Review Process:** Implement a process for reviewing and approving all inline disable comments, particularly those related to security cops.
        *   **Metrics and Reporting:** Track the usage of inline disable comments and generate reports.
        *   **`--auto-gen-config`:** Encourage the use of `rubocop --auto-gen-config` to generate a `.rubocop_todo.yml` file.
