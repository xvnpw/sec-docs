## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Ingestion Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Data into Bullet Streams -> Craft Data with Malicious Payloads -> Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Bullet's Data Processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_ingestion_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_data_into_bullet_streams_-_craft_data_with_4a0a28b8.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious data into Bullet's data streams. This data contains payloads designed to be executed when processed by Bullet or the application.
    *   Critical Node: **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Bullet's Data Processing.** If Bullet doesn't properly sanitize incoming data, malicious payloads (like scripts or commands) can be interpreted and executed, leading to code execution, data manipulation, or other compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Processing Vulnerabilities -> Craft Malicious Queries -> Craft Queries that Expose Sensitive Information -> Exploit Inadequate Access Controls or Data Masking in Bullet's Query Engine](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_processing_vulnerabilities_-_craft_malicious_queries_-_craft_queries_that_expose_sensi_053523ab.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker crafts specific queries to retrieve sensitive information from Bullet's data store.
    *   Critical Node: **Exploit Inadequate Access Controls or Data Masking in Bullet's Query Engine.** If Bullet's query engine lacks proper access controls or data masking, attackers can bypass intended restrictions and access confidential data they shouldn't have permission to view.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses -> Exploit Default or Weak Credentials -> Access Bullet's Admin Interface or Internal Components with Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_exploit_default_or_weak_credentials_-_access_bulle_55f46589.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker attempts to log in to Bullet's administrative interface or internal components using default or easily guessable credentials.
    *   Critical Node: **Access Bullet's Admin Interface or Internal Components with Default Credentials.** Success here grants the attacker significant control over Bullet's configuration, data, and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deployment Practices -> Exploit Lack of Network Segmentation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deployment_practices_-_exploit_lack_of_network_segmentation.md)

*   Attack Vector: The application and Bullet are deployed in a network without proper segmentation.
    *   High-Risk Path (No Specific Critical Node within this path in this simplified view): While "Lack of Network Segmentation" isn't a single exploitable node, it creates a high-risk environment. If any component within the network is compromised, the lack of segmentation allows attackers to easily pivot and access other sensitive systems, including Bullet and the application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Bullet -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Apache Storm -> Leverage Known CVEs in the Deployed Storm Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_bullet_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_apache_storm_-_leverage_known_cves_in_th_4253d31e.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker identifies and exploits known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the deployed version of Apache Storm, a core dependency of Bullet.
    *   Critical Node: **Leverage Known CVEs in the Deployed Storm Version.** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to the compromise of the Storm cluster, potentially allowing attackers to control Bullet's processing logic or access its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Bullet -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch -> Leverage Known CVEs in the Deployed Elasticsearch Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_bullet_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch_-_leverage_known_cves_in_t_3091025c.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker identifies and exploits known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the deployed version of Elasticsearch, often used by Bullet for data storage and querying.
    *   Critical Node: **Leverage Known CVEs in the Deployed Elasticsearch Version.** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to the compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster, potentially allowing attackers to access, modify, or delete Bullet's stored data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channels -> Intercept Communication Between Application and Bullet -> Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack -> Exploit Lack of Encryption or Trust Establishment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channels_-_intercept_communication_between_application_and_bullet_-_perform_ma_00eea629.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker intercepts communication between the application and Bullet, potentially modifying data in transit.
    *   Critical Node: **Exploit Lack of Encryption or Trust Establishment.** If the communication channel isn't properly encrypted (e.g., using HTTPS/TLS) or lacks proper trust establishment mechanisms, attackers can perform MITM attacks to eavesdrop on sensitive data or manipulate requests and responses.
