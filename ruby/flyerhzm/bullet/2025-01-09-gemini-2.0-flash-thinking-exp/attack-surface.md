# Attack Surface Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Development Logs](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_development_logs.md)

* **Description:** Bullet logs notifications about potential performance issues directly into development logs, potentially exposing sensitive data model information and query patterns.
    * **How Bullet Contributes:** Bullet's core function is to identify and report these issues, with logging being a default notification method in development.
    * **Example:** A developer shares their local development logs containing Bullet notifications that reveal table names, column names storing personal information, and relationships between sensitive data models.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain valuable insights into the application's data structure, aiding in crafting targeted attacks or identifying potential data breach opportunities if other vulnerabilities exist.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if logs are inadvertently exposed outside of secure development environments).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure development logs are strictly controlled and not accessible to unauthorized individuals.
        * Avoid sharing full development logs publicly or through insecure channels.
        * Consider alternative notification methods for Bullet in development to reduce reliance on log files for sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Email Notifications (If Configured Insecurely)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_email_notifications__if_configured_insecurely_.md)

* **Description:** If Bullet is configured to send notifications via email without proper encryption, the content of these notifications, which can include details about database queries and potentially sensitive data, could be intercepted.
    * **How Bullet Contributes:** Bullet provides the functionality to send notifications through various channels, including email.
    * **Example:** Bullet sends an email notification about an N+1 query involving the `users` table and their `password_hash` column (even if not the actual hash value, the column name itself is sensitive information). This email is sent over an unencrypted connection and intercepted.
    * **Impact:** Direct exposure of potentially sensitive data and valuable information about the application's data model to unauthorized parties.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if configured insecurely).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never configure Bullet to send notifications via unencrypted email.**
        * If email notifications are absolutely necessary, ensure they are sent over secure, encrypted connections (TLS/SSL).
        * Strongly consider alternative notification methods that do not involve transmitting sensitive information over potentially insecure channels.
