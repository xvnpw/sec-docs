# Threat Model Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Browser Notifications in Production (Misconfiguration)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_browser_notifications_in_production__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:**  If, due to misconfiguration, browser notifications are inadvertently enabled in a production environment, an attacker with access to the application's interface could observe these notifications. These notifications reveal internal application logic, database schema details (table and column names), and relationships between models by exposing information about N+1 queries, unused eager loading, and counter cache issues.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical exposure of sensitive application structure and database information in a production environment. This allows attackers to gain deep insights into the application's data model and relationships, significantly aiding in planning and executing more sophisticated attacks, including data breaches or targeted exploitation of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Bullet::Notification::Javascript` module, specifically its functionality to display notifications in the browser, and the overall configuration settings that control its behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly enforce `Bullet.browser = false` in production configurations.** Utilize environment-specific configurations to guarantee this setting.
        *   Implement automated checks and monitoring to ensure Bullet's production configuration is correct and browser notifications are disabled.
        *   Regularly review and audit production configurations.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Highly Verbose Logging in Production (Misconfiguration)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_highly_verbose_logging_in_production__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** If Bullet's logging level is incorrectly configured to be highly verbose in a production environment, sensitive information about database queries, including model names, associations, and potentially even parts of SQL queries, will be written to the application logs. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized individuals (due to misconfigured permissions, insecure log management practices, or vulnerabilities in log aggregation systems), this information can be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** High risk of exposing sensitive application structure, database relationships, and potentially sensitive data contained within queries in a production environment. This information can be exploited for reconnaissance, understanding data flow, and identifying potential targets for data extraction or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Bullet::Notification::Log` module and the configuration settings that control the verbosity of logging (`Bullet.log_level`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure Bullet's logging level is set to an appropriate, less verbose level in production (e.g., `Bullet.log_level = :warn` or `:error`).**
        *   Implement robust security measures for production log files, including strict access controls, secure storage, and regular auditing.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive data directly in application code that might be picked up by Bullet's logging, even at lower verbosity levels.
        *   Utilize secure log management practices and ensure log aggregation systems are properly secured.
