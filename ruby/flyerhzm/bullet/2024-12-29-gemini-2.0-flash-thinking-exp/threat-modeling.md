*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data via Browser Notifications in Non-Development Environments

    *   **Description:** If Bullet's browser notifications are accidentally enabled in staging or production environments, sensitive data contained within the flagged queries could be displayed directly in the browser to unintended users or attackers who gain access to user sessions. This directly leverages Bullet's notification feature to expose data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of internal application details, potential for social engineering attacks if sensitive information is revealed to malicious actors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bullet's browser notification feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly enforce environment-based configuration:** Ensure browser notifications are only enabled in development environments.
        *   Implement robust environment variable management to prevent accidental configuration errors.
        *   Regularly audit the application's configuration in non-development environments to confirm Bullet's browser notifications are disabled.

*   **Threat:** Performance Degradation in Production due to Accidental Activation

    *   **Description:** If Bullet is mistakenly left enabled in a production environment, its instrumentation of ActiveRecord queries can introduce performance overhead. This overhead, while usually small, can become significant under high load, potentially leading to slower response times and a denial of service for legitimate users. This is a direct consequence of Bullet's core functionality being active where it shouldn't be.
    *   **Impact:** Reduced application performance, negative user experience, potential service outages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bullet's ActiveRecord instrumentation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly enforce environment-based configuration:** Ensure Bullet is disabled in production environments.
        *   Implement automated checks and monitoring to detect if Bullet is unexpectedly active in production.
        *   Use feature flags or environment variables to control Bullet's activation.
