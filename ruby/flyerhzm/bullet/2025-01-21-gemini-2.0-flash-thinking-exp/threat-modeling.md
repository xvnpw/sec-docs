# Threat Model Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Bullet Logs](./threats/information_disclosure_via_bullet_logs.md)

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Bullet Logs
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Bullet's log files (e.g., through misconfigured server permissions, exposed log endpoints, or compromised accounts). They can then read the logs, which often contain detailed information about database queries, including the involved models, attributes, and potentially sensitive data used in those queries. This allows the attacker to understand the application's data structure, relationships, and potentially extract sensitive information directly from the logged queries.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, intellectual property (understanding of data model), potential for further targeted attacks based on revealed information.
    * **Affected Component:** `Bullet::Notification::Log` module (responsible for logging notifications), the configured logger (e.g., `Rails.logger`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure log file storage with appropriate file system permissions.
        * Implement log rotation and retention policies to limit the window of exposure.
        * Avoid logging sensitive data directly in queries where possible. Consider sanitizing or masking sensitive information before it reaches the logging stage.
        * Restrict access to log files to authorized personnel only.
        * If logging to external services, ensure those services have robust security measures.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Bullet or its Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_bullet_or_its_dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Bullet or its Dependencies
    * **Description:** Like any software, the `bullet` gem itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause other harm to the application or the server it runs on.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from information disclosure and data breaches to complete system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `bullet` gem.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability exists)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `bullet` gem to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to Bullet.
        * Consider using tools like `bundler-audit` to scan for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including Bullet.
