# Attack Surface Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Browser Notifications](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_browser_notifications.md)

*   **Description:** Bullet displays notifications directly in the browser during development, alerting developers to potential N+1 queries, unused eager loading, etc.

    *   **How Bullet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Bullet's core functionality is to provide this real-time feedback within the browser interface.

    *   **Example:** A developer is screen-sharing their development environment during a meeting, and a Bullet notification reveals the application is fetching all users and then their associated orders in a loop (an N+1 query). An attacker observing this screen share gains insight into the application's data model and inefficient query patterns.

    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal data structures, relationships between models, and inefficient query patterns. This information can be used by attackers to understand the application's architecture and potentially craft more targeted attacks against the production environment.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if inadvertently enabled in staging or production).

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly limit Bullet usage to development environments.** Ensure it's disabled or not included in production or staging environments.
        *   **Be cautious during screen sharing or recording sessions** while Bullet is active.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Bullet Logs](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_bullet_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Bullet can be configured to log its findings to application logs.

    *   **How Bullet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Bullet's logging mechanism, while helpful for debugging, can inadvertently expose sensitive information.

    *   **Example:** Bullet logs reveal that a specific endpoint frequently triggers an N+1 query involving user email addresses and order details. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized personnel (e.g., due to misconfigured log storage or access controls), this information is exposed.

    *   **Impact:** Similar to browser notifications, log data can reveal internal data structures, relationships, and query patterns. If logs contain specific data values (even indirectly through query analysis), it could lead to the exposure of sensitive business information.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if logs are publicly accessible or poorly secured).

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure application logs are stored securely** with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Implement proper log rotation and retention policies** to minimize the window of exposure.
