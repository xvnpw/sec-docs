### 3.3. Data Flow

The system manages two primary data flows: the ingestion of data into Druid and the processing of user queries.

#### 3.3.1. Data Ingestion Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Data Source"
        A["'Data Source'"]
    end
    B["'Data Ingestion Pipeline'"]
    C["'Apache Druid Ingestion'"]

    A --> B
    B --> C
```

*   Data originates from diverse sources such as application logs, sensor data, or transactional databases.
*   The Data Ingestion Pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) the data.
*   Druid's ingestion mechanisms (e.g., Kafka indexing service, batch ingestion jobs) persist the data within the Druid cluster.

#### 3.3.2. Query Processing Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User"
        A["'Web Browser'"]
        subgraph "External System"
            G["'API Client'"]
        end
    end
    B["'Load Balancer'"]
    C["'Bullet API Server'"]
    D["'Bullet Query Engine'"]
    E["'Apache Druid Cluster'"]
    F["'Query Results'"]

    A --> B
    G --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> D
    D --> C
    C --> A
    C --> G
```

*   A user initiates a query through the Web Browser or an external system sends a request via the API Client.
*   The request is routed by the Load Balancer to an available Bullet API Server instance.
*   The Bullet API Server authenticates and authorizes the user or API client.
*   The query is received and validated by the API Server.
*   The API Server passes the query to the Bullet Query Engine.
*   The Query Engine translates the query into a Druid-compatible format and sends it to the Apache Druid Cluster.
*   Druid processes the query against its stored data and returns the results to the Query Engine.
*   The Query Engine may cache the results (optional) and transforms them into a suitable format.
*   The Query Engine sends the formatted results back to the Bullet API Server.
*   The API Server sends the results back to the originating Web Browser or API Client.
