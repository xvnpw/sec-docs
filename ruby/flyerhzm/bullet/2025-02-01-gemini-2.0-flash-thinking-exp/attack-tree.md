## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Bullet](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_bullet.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Information Disclosure via Bullet
*   **Description:** The attacker aims to extract sensitive information from the application by exploiting Bullet's logging and reporting features, specifically when these are misconfigured or overly verbose in production or accessible environments. This information can include database schema details, query structures, and potentially sensitive data embedded within queries.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable intrusive reporting mechanisms (alert, console, footer) in production.
    *   Secure Bullet log files and Rails logger output, ensuring they are not web-accessible.
    *   Minimize logging verbosity in production configurations.
    *   Regularly review Bullet configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Verbose Logging](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_verbose_logging.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Exploit Verbose Logging
*   **Description:** Attackers target scenarios where Bullet is configured to log excessively detailed information, particularly in production or accessible environments. This verbose logging can inadvertently expose sensitive data through log files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize logging verbosity in production configurations.
    *   Use `bullet.skip_if` and `bullet.only_n_plus_one_queries` to fine-tune logging.
    *   Regularly review and audit Bullet configuration settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Bullet Log File](./attack_tree_paths/access_bullet_log_file.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Access Bullet Log File
*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Bullet log files. If these files are accessible, they can contain valuable information about database queries and application behavior, potentially leading to information disclosure.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Bullet log files in non-web-accessible locations.
    *   Restrict filesystem permissions on log directories and files.
    *   Implement log rotation and secure log management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Web-Accessible Log File](./attack_tree_paths/web-accessible_log_file.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Web-Accessible Log File
*   **Description:** This is a specific case of accessing Bullet log files where the web server is misconfigured to serve the directory containing the log files directly over HTTP/HTTPS. This makes the logs easily accessible to anyone with web access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure log directories are outside the web server's document root.
    *   Configure web server to explicitly deny access to log directories.
    *   Regularly audit web server configurations for misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Web Server exposes logs directory](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_web_server_exposes_logs_directory.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Misconfigured Web Server exposes logs directory
*   **Description:** This is the root cause of the "Web-Accessible Log File" vulnerability.  The web server configuration is flawed, allowing direct access to directories that should be protected, including those containing Bullet log files.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low (Exploiting an existing misconfiguration)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic web browsing skills to access exposed directory)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Web server access logs might show unusual directory traversal attempts, vulnerability scanning can detect misconfigurations)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure web server configuration practices.
    *   Regularly audit web server configurations.
    *   Use security scanning tools to identify web server misconfigurations.
    *   Follow least privilege principles for web server file access.
