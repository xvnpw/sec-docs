# Threat Model Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Query Data in Bullet Notifications and Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_query_data_in_bullet_notifications_and_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to poorly secured development or staging environment logs or Bullet notifications. These logs and notifications contain database queries that include highly sensitive data (e.g., production-like PII, financial information, API keys). The attacker extracts this sensitive information, leading to significant data breach, identity theft, financial fraud, or severe reputational damage. This is possible if development/staging environments are not properly isolated and secured, and Bullet logs are not adequately protected.
    *   **Impact:** High severity confidentiality breach, significant data privacy violations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), major reputational damage, substantial financial losses, potential legal repercussions and regulatory fines.
    *   **Bullet Component Affected:** Logging module, Notification system (browser notifications, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (in poorly secured development/staging environments with sensitive data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolutely disable Bullet in production environments.**
        *   **Implement strong isolation and security for development and staging environments.** Treat staging environments as semi-production and apply similar security controls.
        *   **Enforce strict access control to development and staging environments.** Limit access to authorized personnel only and use multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Implement comprehensive and secure log management practices.** This includes:
            *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to logs to only authorized personnel.
            *   **Encryption:** Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
            *   **Secure Storage:** Store logs in secure and monitored locations.
            *   **Regular Auditing:** Audit log access and usage.
        *   **Minimize the use of production-like sensitive data in development and staging environments.** Use anonymized or synthetic data whenever possible.
        *   **Regularly review Bullet logs and notifications in development and staging environments for inadvertently logged sensitive data.** Implement automated scanning if feasible.
        *   **Consider configuring Bullet to redact or mask potentially sensitive data in notifications and logs.** While this might reduce utility, it can significantly decrease the risk of exposure.
        *   **Educate developers on the risks of exposing sensitive data in logs and notifications, and on secure development practices.**
