# Attack Surface Analysis for flyerhzm/bullet

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Bullet Hints Displayed to End-Users in Production](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_bullet_hints_displayed_to_end-users_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive application information, including data model details, database query patterns, and internal associations, is directly exposed to end-users through Bullet hints when the gem is mistakenly enabled and configured to display alerts or console logs in a production environment.
    *   **How Bullet Contributes:** Bullet is designed to generate hints about N+1 queries and unused eager loading. When enabled and configured to display browser-based notifications (alerts, console logs), these hints become directly visible to users interacting with the application in production.
    *   **Example:** A user browsing their profile page in production sees a JavaScript alert box triggered by Bullet, displaying: "N+1 query detected: User => Order. Associations: [:line_items, :shipping_address]". This reveals the existence of `Order`, `line_items`, and `shipping_address` models and their relationships to the `User` model, directly in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  **High**. Direct exposure of internal application details to potentially untrusted users. Attackers can leverage this information for reconnaissance, gaining deep insights into the application's data structure and relationships. This knowledge can be used to craft targeted attacks, understand business logic, and potentially identify vulnerabilities related to data access and manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Environment-Based Enablement:**  Ensure `Bullet.enable = true` is exclusively within development and staging environments using robust environment checks (e.g., `Rails.env.development?`).
        *   **Disable Browser Notifications in Production:** Even if accidentally enabled, configure Bullet to *not* display browser alerts or console logs in production using `Bullet.alert = false` and `Bullet.console = false` within production-specific configurations.
        *   **Automated Production Verification:** Implement automated checks in deployment pipelines to rigorously verify that Bullet is fully disabled and browser notifications are turned off in production deployments.
        *   **Configuration Hardening:**  Adopt a "deny by default" approach for Bullet configurations in production, explicitly disabling all hint display mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Bullet Hints in Production Server Logs](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_bullet_hints_in_production_server_logs.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive application details are logged into production server logs through Bullet hints when logging is enabled and Bullet is active in production. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized parties, this information becomes compromised.
    *   **How Bullet Contributes:** Bullet can be configured to log hints to server logs. If this logging feature is active and Bullet is running in production, detailed hints about database queries and associations are written to production logs.
    *   **Example:** Production server logs contain entries like: `[Bullet] n+1 query detected: Product => Category. Associations: [:parent_category, :child_categories]`. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to these logs can learn about the `Product`, `Category`, `parent_category`, and `child_categories` models and their complex hierarchical relationships.
    *   **Impact:** **High**.  Compromise of sensitive application architecture and data model information if production logs are accessed by attackers. This information can be used for advanced reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, and potentially data breaches if logs contain sensitive data values alongside the structural hints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Bullet Logging in Production:**  Explicitly disable Bullet's logging functionality in production environments using `Bullet.bullet_logger = false` or similar configuration settings.
        *   **Secure Production Log Access:** Implement stringent access controls and security measures for production logging systems. Restrict access to logs to only essential and authorized personnel. Regularly audit access logs.
        *   **Log Sanitization (If Logging is Absolutely Necessary):** If logging Bullet hints in production is unavoidable for some reason (highly discouraged), implement log sanitization techniques to remove or redact sensitive information from the logged hints before they are written to persistent storage. However, disabling logging is the strongly preferred approach.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Logging Infrastructure:** Conduct periodic security audits of the entire production logging infrastructure, including access controls, storage mechanisms, and log retention policies, to ensure ongoing security and prevent unauthorized access.
