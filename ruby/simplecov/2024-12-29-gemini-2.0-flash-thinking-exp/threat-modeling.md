### High and Critical SimpleCov Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the SimpleCov Ruby code coverage tool:

*   **Threat:** Performance Overhead Exploitation in Non-Development Environments
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either internal or external with access to a non-development environment where SimpleCov is mistakenly enabled, could intentionally trigger actions that cause significant code execution. This would amplify the performance overhead introduced by SimpleCov's instrumentation, leading to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion (CPU, memory), potential service disruption or outage in staging or production environments.
    *   **Affected SimpleCov Component:** Instrumentation module (specifically the code injected to track execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if accidentally in production).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure SimpleCov is strictly limited to development and testing environments through environment variables or configuration.
        *   Implement robust build processes that explicitly exclude SimpleCov and its dependencies from production builds.
        *   Regularly audit deployed environments to confirm SimpleCov is not present.

*   **Threat:** Information Leakage via Coverage Data in Reports
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to SimpleCov's generated coverage reports. These reports might inadvertently contain snippets of sensitive data that were present in the code executed during tests (e.g., API keys, temporary passwords, internal identifiers). This access could be through insecure storage, accidental exposure (e.g., committed to a public repository), or compromised systems.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected SimpleCov Component:** Report generation module (specifically the inclusion of source code snippets).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using sensitive data directly in test code or ensure it's properly sanitized before execution.
        *   Secure the storage location of coverage reports with appropriate access controls.
        *   Do not commit coverage reports to public repositories.
        *   Consider configuring SimpleCov to exclude specific files or directories containing sensitive logic from coverage analysis.
