### High and Critical Guard Threats

This list details high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `guard` gem.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection in Guardfile
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the development environment or the repository containing the `Guardfile`. They then modify the `Guardfile` to include malicious code, such as shell commands or Ruby code, that will be executed when Guard starts.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Guardfile` parsing and execution within the Guard core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control to the development environment and code repositories.
        *   Conduct regular code reviews of the `Guardfile`.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the `Guardfile`. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring for the `Guardfile`.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Guardfile or Plugin Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `Guardfile` or plugin configurations to inject malicious commands that will be executed by Guard's core functionality. This could occur if user-provided input or external data is used to construct commands without proper sanitization within Guard's execution logic.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server or developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Guard core command execution functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in commands executed by Guard.
        *   If user input is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization within the `Guardfile` processing or Guard's core logic.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution where possible within Guard's implementation.
        *   Regularly review `Guardfile` configurations for potential command injection vulnerabilities.
