*   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Guardfile Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system running Guard by modifying the `Guardfile`.
    *   **How Guard Contributes:** The `Guardfile` is a Ruby file, and Guard directly executes the code within it. If an attacker can alter this file, they can inject malicious Ruby code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with write access to the project repository modifies the `Guardfile` to include a command that creates a new administrative user on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the `Guardfile` to only trusted developers.
        *   Implement code review processes for changes to the `Guardfile`.
        *   Use file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Run Guard processes with the least necessary privileges.

*   **Command Injection via Insecure Guardfile Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands that are executed by Guard due to unsanitized user-controlled input being used in commands defined within the `Guardfile` or plugin configurations.
    *   **How Guard Contributes:** Guard often executes shell commands based on events. If the configuration allows for incorporating external input (e.g., filenames) into these commands without proper sanitization, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A Guard plugin configuration allows specifying a command that includes a filename. An attacker creates a file named ``; rm -rf / #` which, when processed by Guard, results in the execution of the dangerous `rm` command.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data deletion, privilege escalation, and other malicious actions depending on the injected command.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in shell commands within Guard configurations.
        *   If external input is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate it before incorporating it into commands.
        *   Prefer using parameterized commands or safer alternatives to direct shell execution within Guard plugins.
        *   Regularly review Guardfile and plugin configurations for potential command injection vulnerabilities.
