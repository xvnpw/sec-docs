## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Guard - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** To execute arbitrary code within the application's environment by exploiting weaknesses in the Guard file monitoring and execution system.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

* Attack: Compromise Application via Guard [CRITICAL]
    * OR
        * Exploit Guardfile Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]
            * AND
                * Gain Write Access to Guardfile [CRITICAL]
                * Inject Malicious Guard Configuration [HIGH RISK]
                    * Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]
                        * Modify existing Guard plugin actions to execute malicious commands [HIGH RISK]
                        * Add new Guard plugins with malicious actions [HIGH RISK]
                    * Trigger Execution of Malicious Code [HIGH RISK]
                        * Define a Guard plugin that executes arbitrary code (e.g., using `system` calls in a custom plugin) [HIGH RISK]
        * Trigger Malicious Actions via File System Manipulation [HIGH RISK]
            * AND
                * Create/Modify Files to Trigger Malicious Actions [HIGH RISK]
                    * Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]
                        * Trigger actions that execute shell commands with attacker-controlled input [HIGH RISK]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Guard [CRITICAL]:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities in the Guard system.

* **Exploit Guardfile Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]:** This attack path involves leveraging weaknesses arising from improper or insecure configuration of the `Guardfile`.

    * **Gain Write Access to Guardfile [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker needs the ability to modify the `Guardfile`. This is a critical node because it grants direct control over Guard's behavior.
        * This could be achieved by:
            * Compromising a developer's machine with access to the repository.
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deployment process that allow file modification.
            * Gaining access to the server's file system through other means (e.g., a web shell).

    * **Inject Malicious Guard Configuration [HIGH RISK]:** Once write access is obtained, the attacker can modify the `Guardfile` to introduce malicious instructions.
        * **Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]:** The attacker aims to make Guard execute arbitrary commands on the server.
            * **Modify existing Guard plugin actions to execute malicious commands [HIGH RISK]:**  Find existing Guard plugins and alter their actions to execute attacker-controlled shell commands.
            * **Add new Guard plugins with malicious actions [HIGH RISK]:** Introduce new Guard plugins that are specifically designed to execute malicious shell commands.
        * **Trigger Execution of Malicious Code [HIGH RISK]:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code within the application's environment.
            * **Define a Guard plugin that executes arbitrary code (e.g., using `system` calls in a custom plugin) [HIGH RISK]:** Create or modify a custom Guard plugin to directly execute malicious code when its associated file changes are detected.

* **Trigger Malicious Actions via File System Manipulation [HIGH RISK]:** This attack path involves manipulating the file system to trigger Guard actions that lead to the execution of malicious code.

    * **Create/Modify Files to Trigger Malicious Actions [HIGH RISK]:** The attacker creates or modifies files in a way that triggers specific Guard actions defined in the `Guardfile`.
        * **Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]:** The attacker aims to trigger Guard actions that execute shell commands.
            * **Trigger actions that execute shell commands with attacker-controlled input [HIGH RISK]:**  Craft file changes that cause Guard to execute shell commands where the input or parameters are influenced by the attacker, allowing for command injection.
