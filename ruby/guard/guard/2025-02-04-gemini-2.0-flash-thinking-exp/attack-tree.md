## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Guard Configuration (Guardfile) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_guard_configuration__guardfile___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The `Guardfile` is the central configuration file for Guard. If an attacker can manipulate it, they can control Guard's behavior to their advantage. This is a critical node because it directly dictates how Guard operates and what actions it performs.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers aim to modify the `Guardfile` to execute malicious commands, disable security features, or alter application behavior through Guard's actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Direct Guardfile Modification [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__direct_guardfile_modification__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Directly altering the content of the `Guardfile` on the system where Guard is running.
    * **Exploitation:** This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary Guard configurations, effectively hijacking Guard's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Exploit Application Vulnerability for File Write [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__exploit_application_vulnerability_for_file_write__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Leveraging vulnerabilities in the application itself (e.g., file upload flaws, path traversal) to gain write access to the file system and overwrite the `Guardfile`.
        * **Exploitation:** By exploiting application weaknesses, attackers can bypass system-level access controls and directly modify the critical `Guardfile`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__compromise_developer_machine__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Compromising a developer's workstation that has access to the application codebase and configuration files, including the `Guardfile`.
        * **Exploitation:** Once a developer machine is compromised, the attacker gains direct access to modify the `Guardfile` and potentially other sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Inject Malicious Configuration via Plugin Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__inject_malicious_configuration_via_plugin_settings__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Guard plugins handle configuration settings to inject malicious configurations.
    * **Exploitation:** Some plugins might have insecure configuration parsing or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands or settings through plugin-specific configuration options.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Plugin Configuration Injection Flaw [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__plugin_configuration_injection_flaw__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specific vulnerabilities in plugin code that allow injection of malicious configuration data, leading to unintended or malicious behavior when the plugin processes these configurations.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers craft malicious configuration inputs that exploit flaws in plugin configuration handling, potentially leading to command execution or other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Guard Plugins [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_guard_plugins__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Guard relies heavily on plugins for its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins represent a significant attack surface. This is a critical node because plugins are external code and can introduce vulnerabilities independent of Guard core.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within Guard plugins to execute malicious code, access sensitive files, or cause denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Vulnerable Plugin Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__vulnerable_plugin_code__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Plugins, being third-party code, can contain vulnerabilities like any other software.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers identify and exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Guard plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1__remote_code_execution__rce__via_plugin__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** A plugin vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where Guard is running.
            * **Exploitation:** By exploiting an RCE vulnerability in a plugin, attackers can gain full control over the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.2. Local File Inclusion/Traversal via Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_2__local_file_inclusiontraversal_via_plugin__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** A plugin vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or data.
            * **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit LFI/Traversal flaws in plugins to access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Malicious Plugin Injection/Installation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__malicious_plugin_injectioninstallation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Tricking users into installing and using malicious Guard plugins.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers distribute malicious plugins disguised as legitimate ones to compromise systems when users install them.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.1. Social Engineering [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_1__social_engineering__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Using social engineering tactics to convince developers or administrators to install a malicious plugin.
            * **Exploitation:** Attackers rely on deception and manipulation to bypass technical security measures and get malicious plugins installed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse Guard's Execution Context [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_guard's_execution_context__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the environment in which Guard runs, particularly how it executes commands and handles permissions.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers aim to leverage Guard's command execution capabilities or privilege levels to perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Command Injection via Guardfile or Plugin Configuration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__command_injection_via_guardfile_or_plugin_configuration__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into Guardfile configurations or plugin settings that are then executed by Guard.
        * **Exploitation:** If Guard or plugins use user-provided input in shell commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Vulnerabilities in Guard Core [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__vulnerabilities_in_guard_core__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the Guard gem itself. This is a critical node because vulnerabilities in the core gem would affect all applications using that version of Guard.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in Guard's core code to gain control over Guard's execution or the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Vulnerabilities in Guard Gem Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__vulnerabilities_in_guard_gem_itself__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specific vulnerabilities present in the Guard gem's code.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the Guard gem to compromise applications using it.
