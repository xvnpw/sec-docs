# Threat Model Analysis for guard/guard

## Threat: [Malicious `.Guardfile` Configuration](./threats/malicious___guardfile__configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (via compromised developer account, malicious insider, or supply chain attack) injects malicious code into the `.Guardfile`. When Guard processes this configuration, it executes arbitrary commands on the developer's machine upon file system events. This can lead to immediate and severe compromise, such as malware installation, data exfiltration, or complete control of the development environment.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, supply chain attacks, and widespread system compromise.
*   **Affected Guard Component:** `.Guardfile` parsing and core command execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory code review for all `.Guardfile` changes.
    *   Strict access control to `.Guardfile` (read-only for most, write access limited to authorized personnel).
    *   Version control and change tracking for `.Guardfile`.
    *   Security awareness training for developers regarding `.Guardfile` security.
    *   Automated checks for suspicious patterns in `.Guardfile` configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Guard Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_guard_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A critical vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, arbitrary file read/write) exists in a widely used Guard plugin. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific file system events or inputs that trigger the vulnerable plugin code. This allows them to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to the developer's system through the plugin's functionality within Guard.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Arbitrary code execution or significant information disclosure on developer machines, potentially leading to data theft, malware infection, and lateral movement within the development network.
*   **Affected Guard Component:** Vulnerable Guard Plugins and their specific modules/functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability type and plugin privileges)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize using plugins from trusted and actively maintained sources with strong security track records.
    *   Implement automated plugin dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   Establish a process for promptly updating Guard plugins to the latest versions, especially security updates.
    *   For critical projects, conduct security code reviews of plugin source code, focusing on input handling and command execution.
    *   Consider plugin sandboxing or isolation techniques if available and feasible.

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerability in Guard Actions](./threats/command_injection_vulnerability_in_guard_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Guard or its plugins improperly sanitize user-controlled input (like filenames or environment variables) when constructing shell commands. An attacker can manipulate this input to inject malicious commands that are then executed by Guard on the developer's machine. This can be achieved by creating files with specially crafted names or manipulating environment variables if they are used in Guard commands without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Arbitrary command execution on developer machines, leading to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Guard Component:** Command execution logic within Guard core and plugins, specifically input handling in command construction functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rigorous input sanitization and validation for all user-controlled data used in commands within `.Guardfile` and plugins.
    *   Employ parameterized command execution methods to prevent command injection.
    *   Minimize reliance on shell commands; prefer using Ruby APIs or libraries directly when possible.
    *   Regular security audits of `.Guardfile` configurations and plugin integrations to identify potential command injection points.

## Threat: [Elevated Privilege Exploitation Amplification via Guard](./threats/elevated_privilege_exploitation_amplification_via_guard.md)

*   **Description:** Developers mistakenly run Guard with elevated privileges (e.g., as root or administrator). If any vulnerability in Guard or its plugins is exploited (like those described above), the attacker gains these elevated privileges directly. This drastically increases the impact of the exploit, allowing for system-wide compromise, kernel-level access, and bypassing security controls that would otherwise limit the damage.
*   **Impact:** **High**.  Significantly amplified impact of other Guard vulnerabilities, leading to potential full system compromise and privilege escalation due to Guard running with elevated permissions.
*   **Affected Guard Component:** Guard's process execution context and any exploitable component within Guard or its plugins.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to the significant amplification of other vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege**: Never run Guard with elevated privileges (root or administrator) in development environments.
    *   Implement automated checks to prevent Guard from being started with elevated privileges.
    *   Educate developers on the severe security risks of running development tools with unnecessary elevated permissions.
    *   Harden development environments to limit the impact of compromised developer accounts, even if Guard is inadvertently run with higher privileges.
