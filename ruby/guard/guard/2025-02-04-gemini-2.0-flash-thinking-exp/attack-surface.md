# Attack Surface Analysis for guard/guard

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `Guardfile`](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via__guardfile_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `Guardfile`, being a Ruby script, allows execution of arbitrary code. If an attacker can modify the `Guardfile`, they can inject malicious Ruby code that Guard will execute.
*   **How Guard Contributes:** Guard is designed to execute the `Guardfile` upon startup and during its operation, directly running any Ruby code contained within it. This is core to Guard's functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine and modifies the project's `Guardfile`. They insert Ruby code that, when Guard starts, downloads and executes a reverse shell, granting the attacker remote access to the developer's system.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, potential supply chain poisoning if the compromised `Guardfile` is committed to a shared repository.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure `Guardfile` Management:** Implement robust version control for the `Guardfile` and enforce mandatory code review for all changes.
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict write access to the `Guardfile` to only authorized and trusted personnel.
    *   **Treat `Guardfile` as Security-Sensitive Code:** Apply the same level of security scrutiny and best practices to the `Guardfile` as you would to any critical application code.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review the `Guardfile` for any unexpected or suspicious code modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Guard Plugin Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_guard_plugin_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Guard's functionality is extended through plugins (Guards) specified in the `Guardfile`. If the `Guardfile` is modified to load malicious plugins from untrusted sources, these plugins can execute arbitrary code when loaded by Guard.
*   **How Guard Contributes:** Guard's plugin architecture inherently involves dynamically loading and executing Ruby gems based on configurations in the `Guardfile`. This mechanism can be exploited to load malicious code.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a project's dependencies or creates a fake, malicious Guard plugin with a similar name to a legitimate one. By tricking a developer into adding this malicious plugin to their `Guardfile` (e.g., through typosquatting or social engineering), the attacker can have arbitrary code executed when Guard starts and loads the plugin.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the development environment, data theft, malware installation, compromised development environment integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Strictly use Guard plugins only from reputable and highly trusted sources, such as the official RubyGems repository and plugins maintained by verified organizations or individuals.
    *   **Plugin Verification:** Before adding a new Guard plugin to the `Guardfile`, thoroughly verify its authenticity and reputation. Check the plugin's source code repository, maintainer, and community feedback.
    *   **Dependency Checking & Auditing:** Use dependency scanning tools to regularly check for vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Guard plugins. Audit the plugin's dependencies for any signs of malicious packages.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Guard processes with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the potential damage if a malicious plugin is loaded and executed.
    *   **Plugin Pinning:**  Pin specific, known-good versions of Guard plugins in your `Gemfile.lock`. This prevents automatic updates that might introduce malicious or vulnerable plugin versions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in `Guardfile` Configurations](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in__guardfile__configurations.md)

*   **Description:**  `Guardfile` configurations often involve executing shell commands to trigger actions like running tests or linters. If user-controlled input (e.g., file paths, environment variables) is incorporated into these commands without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **How Guard Contributes:** Guard directly interprets and executes configurations within the `Guardfile`, including shell commands defined by the user.  If these commands are constructed insecurely, Guard will execute the resulting injected commands.
*   **Example:** A `Guardfile` configuration uses a file path taken from an environment variable within a shell command to run tests. An attacker can manipulate this environment variable to inject malicious shell commands into the command string executed by Guard. For instance, setting the environment variable to `; rm -rf / #` could lead to unintended system-level actions when Guard runs the command.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system, potential system compromise, data manipulation or deletion, escalation of privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Always sanitize and rigorously validate any user-controlled input (including file paths, environment variables, and user-provided arguments) before incorporating them into shell commands within the `Guardfile`.
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands Where Possible:**  Prefer using Ruby methods or built-in Guard functionalities to achieve the desired actions instead of directly executing shell commands.
    *   **Parameterization and Escaping:** When shell commands are absolutely necessary, utilize parameterization or proper escaping mechanisms provided by Ruby's `system`, `exec`, or `Open3` methods to prevent command injection.  Avoid string interpolation of user input directly into shell commands.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Commands:** Ensure that any shell commands executed by Guard are run with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from command injection exploits.
