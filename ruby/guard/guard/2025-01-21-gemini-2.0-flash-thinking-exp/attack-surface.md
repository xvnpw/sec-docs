# Attack Surface Analysis for guard/guard

## Attack Surface: [Guardfile Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/guardfile_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  The `Guardfile` defines what files `guard` monitors and what actions to take upon changes. If compromised, it can be used to execute arbitrary commands.

**How Guard Contributes:** `Guard` directly interprets and executes the commands specified in the `Guardfile`.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `Guardfile` to execute `rm -rf /` when a specific file is changed. When a developer saves that file, the command is executed by `guard`.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the developer's machine or the build/deployment environment where `guard` is running. Data loss, system corruption, and unauthorized access are possible.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the `Guardfile` with appropriate file permissions, limiting write access.
* Store the `Guardfile` in a secure version control system with access controls and history tracking.
* Implement code review processes for changes to the `Guardfile`.
* Avoid storing sensitive information or credentials directly in the `Guardfile`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Guard Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_guard_plugins.md)

**Description:** `Guard` relies on plugins to perform actions. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited.

**How Guard Contributes:** `Guard` loads and executes the code within these plugins, inheriting any vulnerabilities they may contain.

**Example:** A `guard-rspec` plugin has a command injection vulnerability. An attacker crafts a filename that, when changed, causes the plugin to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary commands, information disclosure, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the plugin.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `guard` and all its plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Carefully evaluate the security of plugins before using them. Check for active maintenance, security audits, and reported vulnerabilities.
* Consider using only well-established and reputable plugins.
* Implement input validation and sanitization within custom `guard` plugin configurations where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (Context Dependent)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__context_dependent_.md)

**Description:** If `guard` is run with elevated privileges, vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

**How Guard Contributes:** Running `guard` with higher privileges than necessary increases the potential impact of any exploit.

**Example:** A `guard` process running as root has a vulnerability that allows command injection. An attacker could exploit this to execute commands with root privileges.

**Impact:**  Complete system compromise due to the ability to execute commands with elevated privileges.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if running with unnecessary elevated privileges)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Run `guard` with the least privileges necessary for its operation. Avoid running it as root unless absolutely required.
* Carefully consider the security implications before granting elevated privileges to the `guard` process.
