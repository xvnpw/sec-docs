## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary Commands via Guard](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_execute_arbitrary_commands_via_guard.md)

*   **Goal:** To execute arbitrary commands on the application server by exploiting weaknesses in Guard's configuration or plugins.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Injection**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains the ability to write to the `Guardfile`. This could be through:
        *   Exploiting a vulnerability in the application that allows file writes.
        *   Compromising a developer's machine that has access to the `Guardfile`.
    *   **Impact:**  Once write access is gained, the attacker can inject malicious commands into the `Guardfile`.
*   **Critical Node: Action: Guard executes injected commands on file change**
    *   **Attack Vector:** After injecting malicious commands, the attacker triggers a file change that Guard is monitoring.
    *   **Impact:** Guard executes the injected commands with the privileges of the user running the Guard process, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Guard Plugin Vulnerability**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in one of the Guard plugins being used.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker crafts specific file changes or triggers plugin actions in a way that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Critical Node: Action: Plugin executes arbitrary commands due to vulnerability**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerable plugin, when triggered with malicious input, executes arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to configuration injection, this leads to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Guard Core Vulnerability
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability within the core Guard library itself.
    *   **Impact:** This could allow for arbitrary command execution by crafting specific file changes or interactions that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Critical Node: Action: Guard executes arbitrary commands due to the vulnerability**
    *   **Attack Vector:** By triggering the core vulnerability, the attacker forces Guard to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Application State via Guard's Actions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_application_state_via_guard's_actions.md)

*   **Goal:** To manipulate the application's state in a malicious way by abusing Guard's file change triggers.
*   **High-Risk Path: Abuse Guard's File Change Triggers**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies files that Guard is monitoring, and whose changes trigger critical application logic (e.g., deployment scripts, configuration files).
    *   **Impact:** By modifying these files, the attacker can trigger unintended and potentially harmful actions by the application. This could include:
        *   Deploying malicious code.
        *   Altering application data.
        *   Changing application configuration to create backdoors or weaken security.
