# Threat Model Analysis for guard/guard

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution via Guardfile Injection](./threats/malicious_code_execution_via_guardfile_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or commands directly into the `Guardfile`. When Guard parses and evaluates the `Guardfile`, this malicious code is executed on the system. This directly leverages Guard's functionality to interpret and execute code within its configuration file.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the system where Guard is running, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Guard::Guardfile::Evaluator`: This module is directly responsible for parsing and executing the Ruby code within the `Guardfile`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the `Guardfile` with strict file system permissions, limiting write access to only trusted users.
*   Implement mandatory code review for any changes to the `Guardfile`.
*   Avoid dynamically generating or modifying the `Guardfile` based on external or untrusted input.
*   Consider using a more restricted configuration format if the full power of Ruby in the `Guardfile` is not necessary.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Guard Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_guard_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Guard relies on other Ruby gems and system libraries. If these dependencies have security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through Guard's use of the vulnerable components. This directly involves Guard's dependency management and its reliance on external code.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service on the system running Guard.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`: These files define the dependencies used by Guard.
*   Specific modules or functions within Guard that utilize the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Guard and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`, `snyk`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Guard's dependencies.
*   Stay informed about security advisories for the gems Guard depends on.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation if Guard Runs with Elevated Privileges](./threats/privilege_escalation_if_guard_runs_with_elevated_privileges.md)

**Description:** If Guard is configured to run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root), a vulnerability within Guard itself or a maliciously crafted `Guardfile` can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with those elevated privileges. This directly involves Guard's execution context and its ability to run commands.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the system due to the attacker gaining root or administrator access.

**Affected Component:**
*   The system's process execution mechanism when running Guard.
*   Potentially any part of Guard if a vulnerability allows arbitrary command execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Run Guard with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid running Guard as root unless absolutely unavoidable.
*   If elevated privileges are required for specific actions, explore alternative solutions like using `sudo` with specific command restrictions instead of running the entire Guard process with elevated privileges.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Guard Actions](./threats/information_disclosure_through_guard_actions.md)

**Description:** Guard actions, defined in the `Guardfile` or custom Guard plugins, might be designed or configured in a way that unintentionally exposes sensitive information. This directly involves how Guard's actions are implemented and what data they handle.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, or other confidential information.

**Affected Component:**
*   Specific Guard plugins (e.g., `guard-shell`, custom plugins).
*   Custom Guard definitions within the `Guardfile` that perform actions.
*   Logging mechanisms used by Guard or its plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and review Guard actions to ensure they do not handle or expose sensitive information unnecessarily.
*   Avoid logging sensitive data within Guard actions or plugins.
*   Restrict access to the output or destination of Guard actions to authorized users or systems.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion by Guard Actions](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_by_guard_actions.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor could trigger file system events that cause Guard to execute resource-intensive actions repeatedly, leading to a denial of service. This directly involves Guard's event handling and action execution mechanisms.

**Impact:** The system running Guard becomes unresponsive or overloaded, potentially impacting other applications or services on the same machine.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Guard::Listener`: This component monitors file system events that trigger actions.
*   Specific Guard plugins or custom Guard definitions that perform resource-intensive operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Design Guard actions to be efficient and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
*   Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for Guard actions if feasible.
*   Monitor the resource usage of the Guard process and set limits if necessary.
*   Use specific file matching patterns in the `Guardfile` to limit the scope of monitored files and prevent triggering actions on a large number of irrelevant files.

## Threat: [Tampering with Application State through Guard Actions](./threats/tampering_with_application_state_through_guard_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate files monitored by Guard to trigger actions that modify the application's state in a malicious way. This directly involves Guard's role in reacting to file changes and executing corresponding actions.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, data corruption, or the introduction of vulnerabilities into the application.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Guard::Listener`: Monitors file system changes.
*   Specific Guard plugins or custom Guard definitions that modify application state based on file changes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application to handle changes triggered by Guard actions.
*   Secure the files monitored by Guard with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications.
*   Implement mechanisms to detect and revert unauthorized changes to application state.
