## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Guard Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_guard_authorization.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Logic Flaws in Guard Configuration (Rules) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** This is the most direct and likely attack path. Attackers exploit errors in how the authorization rules are defined within the `Guardfile` or other configuration files.
    *   **1.1.1 Misconfigured `policy` blocks (Incorrect Scope/Permissions) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The core of Guard's functionality.  Errors here fundamentally compromise the authorization system.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Overly permissive rules (e.g., `can :manage, :all`) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Granting broad permissions without specific restrictions.  This is a classic "least privilege" violation.
            *   **Example:**  A rule like `can :manage, :all` allows a user to perform *any* action on *any* resource.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if auditing is in place, otherwise Hard)
        *   **1.1.1.2 Incorrectly defined conditions (e.g., flawed logic in custom conditions) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Using custom Ruby code within `policy` blocks to define conditions, but the code contains logical errors or doesn't handle edge cases.
            *   **Example:** A condition that checks user roles but fails to account for a specific, less common role, inadvertently granting access.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **1.1.1.3 Missing or incomplete rules (allowing unintended access) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Failing to define rules for specific actions or resources, resulting in a default-allow situation (if Guard is configured that way) or unexpected behavior.
            *   **Example:**  Forgetting to define a rule for a new API endpoint, leaving it unprotected.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **1.3 Manipulate Guard's State**
    *   **1.3.1 Modify loaded rules (if rules are loaded from an insecure source) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  This attack targets the integrity of the rules themselves. If the attacker can change the rules, they can bypass all authorization.
        *   **1.3.1.2 Compromise the rule file storage location [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Gaining write access to the file(s) where Guard rules are stored (e.g., `Guardfile`).
            *   **Example:**  Exploiting a server vulnerability to gain access to the file system and modify the `Guardfile`.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with file integrity monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Guard's Intended Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_guard's_intended_functionality.md)

*   **2.2 Exploit Weaknesses in Guard's Integration with the Application [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** This focuses on how the application *uses* Guard.  Even with perfect rules, incorrect integration can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **2.2.1 Incorrect usage of Guard's API (e.g., not calling `can?` correctly) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The application code must correctly use Guard's API (primarily the `can?` method) to enforce authorization.  Mistakes here bypass the checks.
        *   **2.2.1.1 Bypassing authorization checks due to incorrect API calls [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Calling `can?` with the wrong arguments, forgetting to call it at all, or misinterpreting the result.
            *   **Example:**  Calling `can?(:read, @article)` when the correct call should be `can?(:update, @article)`.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with thorough testing)
    *   **2.2.2 Inconsistent authorization checks (using Guard in some parts, but not others) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Applying Guard's authorization checks to some parts of the application but not others, creating unprotected pathways.
        *   **2.2.2.1 Accessing resources without going through Guard's authorization [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Directly accessing resources (e.g., database records, files) without first checking authorization through Guard.
            *   **Example:**  A controller action that directly fetches data from the database without calling `can?` to verify the user's permissions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with code review and testing)
