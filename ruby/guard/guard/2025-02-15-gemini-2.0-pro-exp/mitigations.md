# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for guard/guard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Permissions (for `Guardfile` and related files)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_permissions__for__guardfile__and_related_files_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify `guard`-Specific Files:**  Focus on `Guardfile`, `.guard.rb`, and any custom Ruby files *included* by the `Guardfile`.
2.  **Determine `guard`'s Running User:** Identify the user account under which the `guard` process *itself* runs.
3.  **Set Restrictive Permissions:** Use `chmod` to set permissions:
    *   `chmod 600 Guardfile`: Read/write only for the `guard` process owner.
    *   `chmod 600 .guard.rb`: Read/write only for the owner.
    *   `chmod 600 custom_script.rb` (if included by `Guardfile`): Read/write only for the owner.
4.  **Verify:** Use `ls -l` to confirm.
5.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule checks to ensure permissions haven't changed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of `Guardfile` (Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting commands into `guard`'s configuration.
*   **Unauthorized Execution of Arbitrary Code (via `guard`) (Critical):**  Directly prevents `guard` from executing attacker-controlled code.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of `Guardfile`:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
*   **Unauthorized Execution of Arbitrary Code (via `guard`):** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `Guardfile`: Permissions set to `600`.
*   `.guard.rb`: Permissions set to `600`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `scripts/custom_guard_actions.rb`: Included by `Guardfile`, has `644` permissions (world-readable). Needs to be `600`.
*   Automated permission audit script is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Version Control (Specifically for `Guardfile` changes)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_version_control__specifically_for__guardfile__changes_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Version Control:** `Guardfile` and related files *must* be in version control (e.g., Git).
2.  **Pull Requests:** All changes *must* go through pull requests.
3.  **Mandatory Review:**  *Every* change to the `Guardfile` and included files *requires* review and approval by another developer *before* merging.
4.  **Review Focus (for `guard`):** Reviewers *must* specifically check for:
    *   New shell commands.
    *   Use of untrusted input in commands within the `Guardfile`.
    *   Changes that could weaken `guard`'s security.
5.  **Commit History:** Regularly review the commit history of `guard`-related files.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of `Guardfile` (Critical):** Makes unauthorized changes much harder.
*   **Accidental Introduction of `guard`-Specific Vulnerabilities (High):** Catches mistakes in `guard` configuration.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of `Guardfile`:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium.
*   **Accidental Introduction of `guard`-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `Guardfile` and `.guard.rb` are in Git.
*   Pull requests are required.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal, documented policy requiring mandatory review of *all* `Guardfile` changes is missing.
*   Regular review of `guard` file commit history is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic `Guardfile` Generation](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic__guardfile__generation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Static `Guardfile`:** The `Guardfile` *must* be a static file, checked into version control.
2.  **No User Input:**  Absolutely *no* user input should influence the `Guardfile`'s content.
3.  **No External Data:** The `Guardfile` *must not* be generated from external sources that could be compromised.
4.  **Configuration via Environment Variables (for `guard` settings):** Use environment variables to configure `guard` differently across environments, *not* different `Guardfile`s.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (via `guard`) (Critical):** Prevents attackers from controlling `guard`'s actions.
*   **Complete System Compromise (via `guard`) (Critical):**  A direct path to system takeover through `guard`.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (via `guard`):** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.
*   **Complete System Compromise (via `guard`):** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The `Guardfile` is static.
*   No user input is used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   None. This is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (for the `guard` *process* itself)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__for_the__guard__process_itself_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify `guard`'s Needs:** Determine the *minimum* permissions the `guard` *process* needs.
2.  **Dedicated User (Recommended):** Create a dedicated user (e.g., `guard_user`) *just* for running `guard`.
3.  **Grant Minimal Permissions:** Grant the `guard` user (or the user running `guard`) *only* the necessary permissions. Use `chown` and `chmod`.
4.  **Avoid `sudo`:** *Never* run `guard` with `sudo` or as `root`.
5.  **Test:** Thoroughly test `guard` with the reduced privileges.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (if `guard` is compromised) (High):** Limits the damage from a compromised `guard` process.
*   **Data Breach (via compromised `guard`) (High):** Reduces `guard`'s access to sensitive data.

**Impact:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (if `guard` is compromised):** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Data Breach (via compromised `guard`):** Risk reduced from High to Medium/Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `guard` is run under the developer's user account.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A dedicated `guard_user` has *not* been created.
*   Permissions have *not* been explicitly minimized. This is a major area for improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Command Injection Prevention (within `Guardfile` actions)](./mitigation_strategies/command_injection_prevention__within__guardfile__actions_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Shell Commands (in `Guardfile`):** Find all instances where the `Guardfile` executes shell commands (using `system`, `exec`, backticks).
2.  **Analyze Input (to those commands):** Determine if any part of the command string comes from untrusted input.
3.  **Use Array Form:** Prefer `system('command', 'arg1', 'arg2')` over string interpolation.
4.  **Escape Untrusted Input (if necessary):** If you *must* use string interpolation, use `Shellwords.escape`:
    ```ruby
    require 'shellwords'
    safe_input = Shellwords.escape(untrusted_input)
    system("command #{safe_input}") # within the Guardfile
    ```
5.  **Avoid Backticks:** Avoid using backticks within the `Guardfile`.
6.  **Test (specifically for `guard` actions):** Create tests that try to inject malicious shell metacharacters into any input used by `guard`'s commands.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Command Injection (via `guard` actions) (Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting shell commands through `guard`.
*   **Remote Code Execution (through `guard`) (Critical):** A direct consequence of command injection.

**Impact:**
*   **Command Injection (via `guard` actions):** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
*   **Remote Code Execution (through `guard`):** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some commands use the array form.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `scripts/custom_guard_actions.rb` (included by `Guardfile`) has a command with *unsafe* string interpolation: `system("process_data #{params[:data]}")`. This is a *critical vulnerability* within the `guard` configuration.
*   Comprehensive testing for command injection in `guard` actions is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Debouncing/Throttling (within `guard`'s configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/debouncingthrottling__within__guard_'s_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Frequent `guard` Actions:** Determine which `guard` actions are triggered most often.
2.  **Use Plugin Options:** Check if the `guard` *plugins* you use have built-in debouncing/throttling options. Use them.
3.  **Custom Debouncing (for `guard`):** If a plugin lacks debouncing, you might need to implement it *within your `Guardfile`*. This could involve timers or tracking the last execution time.
4.  **Configure Thresholds:** Set appropriate debouncing/throttling thresholds for each `guard` action.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (targeting `guard`) (Medium):** Prevents overwhelming the system by triggering `guard` actions repeatedly.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (caused by `guard`) (Medium):** Reduces `guard`'s resource usage.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (targeting `guard`):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (caused by `guard`):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `guard-rspec` has a debounce delay configured.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `guard-livereload` has *no* debouncing. Rapid changes could trigger excessive browser reloads. This needs to be addressed within the `Guardfile`'s configuration of `guard-livereload`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Temporary File Handling (by `guard` and its plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_temporary_file_handling__by__guard__and_its_plugins_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Temporary File Usage (within `guard` context):** Examine `guard` and *plugin* code to find temporary file creation.
2.  **Use `Tempfile` (in `guard` actions):** Ensure Ruby's `Tempfile` class is used *within the `Guardfile` and any custom scripts it includes*.
3.  **Explicit Deletion (in `guard` actions):** Explicitly delete temporary files using `tempfile.unlink` or `tempfile.close` when done, *within the `Guardfile` or related scripts*.
4.  **Avoid Hardcoded Paths (in `guard` actions):** Do not use hardcoded paths for temporary files *within the `Guardfile`*.
5. **Review Plugin Code:** If using third-party `guard` plugins, review their source code (if available) to ensure they handle temporary files securely. This is less direct, but still related to `guard`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (from `guard`'s temporary files) (Medium):** Prevents unauthorized access to data in `guard`'s temporary files.
*   **Race Conditions (in `guard`'s file handling) (Medium):** Avoids race conditions.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure (from `guard`'s temporary files):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Race Conditions (in `guard`'s file handling):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The core `guard` gem appears to use `Tempfile` correctly.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A custom `guard` plugin (`guard-custom-processor`) uses `File.open` with a *hardcoded path* in `/tmp`. This is *insecure* and needs to be changed to use `Tempfile` *within the plugin's code*.  This is a vulnerability within a component directly used by `guard`.
*   The `guard-custom-processor` code does not explicitly delete the temporary file.
