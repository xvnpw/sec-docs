# Threat Model Analysis for guard/guard

## Threat: [Guardfile Command Injection](./threats/guardfile_command_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** `Guardfile` Command Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `Guardfile` to include arbitrary shell commands. This is done through a compromised developer account, a malicious pull request, or direct access to the repository. The attacker crafts a command within a `guard` block (e.g., within a `cmd` option, a `system` call, or a custom Ruby block within a `watch` block) that will be executed when `guard` triggers.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `guard`. This can lead to data theft, system modification, or further network compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Guardfile` (the main configuration file), specifically any section allowing command execution (e.g., `cmd`, `system`, custom Ruby code within `watch` blocks). The `Guard::Runner` class, which executes commands, is directly involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, multi-person code reviews for *all* `Guardfile` changes.
        *   **Signed Commits:** Require developers to sign Git commits, verifying `Guardfile` change authenticity.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `guard` as a dedicated, unprivileged user with minimal system access.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Use external tools (not `guard`) to monitor the `Guardfile` for unauthorized changes.
        *   **Repository Access Control:** Strictly limit write access to the repository containing the `Guardfile`.

## Threat: [Malicious Guard Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_guard_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Guard Plugin Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious `guard` plugin to a public repository (e.g., RubyGems). A developer installs and uses the plugin, unaware of its malicious nature. The plugin contains code that executes arbitrary commands or performs other malicious actions when triggered by `guard`.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions, depending on the plugin's code. The attacker gains control equivalent to the user running `guard`.
    *   **Affected Component:** The installed malicious `guard` plugin (its Ruby code). The `Guard::Plugin` base class and the plugin loading mechanism are directly involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully research and vet any third-party `guard` plugins before installation. Check the plugin's reputation, author, and source code (if available).
        *   **Source Code Review:** If possible, review the plugin's source code for suspicious code.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (like Bundler) to explicitly specify and lock the versions of all `guard` plugins.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all `guard` plugins updated to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run `guard` within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `guard` as an unprivileged user.

## Threat: [Indirect Privilege Escalation through `guard`](./threats/indirect_privilege_escalation_through__guard_.md)

* **Threat**: Indirect Privilege Escalation through `guard`

    * **Description**: A compromised `guard` process, running with a user that has *some* privileged access (e.g., write access to a system configuration file), is used to modify that file or perform other actions that ultimately lead to gaining higher privileges. This is *not* about running `guard` as root, but about exploiting existing, limited privileges that the `guard` user possesses.
    * **Impact**: System compromise, potentially leading to root access.
    * **Affected Component**: The `Guardfile`, the compromised plugin (if applicable), and any system files or resources that the `guard` user has write access to. The core `Guard` components that execute commands and interact with the filesystem are directly involved.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**: 
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Reinforced)**: Ensure the user running `guard` has *absolutely minimal* permissions. Avoid granting *any* unnecessary write access to system files or directories.
        *   **System Hardening**: Follow general system hardening guidelines to limit privilege escalation, regardless of `guard`.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (System-Wide)**: Monitor critical system files for unauthorized changes, using tools *independent* of `guard`.
        *   **Sandboxing**: Running `guard` in a container significantly reduces the attack surface.
