# Attack Surface Analysis for guard/guard

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Guardfile (`Guardfile`) Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_guardfile___guardfile___modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `Guardfile` and modifies it to execute arbitrary commands.

**How Guard Contributes:** `guard` directly interprets and executes the Ruby code within the `Guardfile` whenever a watched file changes. This provides a direct mechanism for executing attacker-controlled commands.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `Guardfile` to include `system("rm -rf /")` which would be executed on the developer's machine when a file is saved.

**Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the developer's machine, data loss, code injection into the project.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict write access to the `Guardfile` to only trusted users and processes.
* Implement code review for any changes to the `Guardfile`.
* Consider using a version control system for the `Guardfile` to track changes.
* Employ file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerable Guard Plugins](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerable_guard_plugins.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in a `guard` plugin, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.

**How Guard Contributes:** `guard` loads and executes the code of its plugins. If a plugin has a security flaw, `guard` provides the context for that flaw to be exploited.

**Example:** A vulnerable plugin might not properly sanitize user input (e.g., file paths) leading to path traversal and arbitrary file read/write when triggered by a file change.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `guard` and all its plugins to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
* Carefully evaluate the security reputation and maintenance status of plugins before using them.
* Consider auditing the source code of plugins, especially those from less trusted sources.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Guard or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_guard_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** `guard` or its plugins rely on other Ruby gems that contain known security vulnerabilities.

**How Guard Contributes:** `guard` depends on a set of gems, and its plugins also have their own dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not addressed.

**Example:** A dependency used by a `guard` plugin might have a remote code execution vulnerability that could be triggered when the plugin is loaded or executed.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `guard` and all its plugins to the latest versions.
* Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `rails_best_practices` (with security checks enabled) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Keep your development environment's Ruby and gem versions up-to-date.
