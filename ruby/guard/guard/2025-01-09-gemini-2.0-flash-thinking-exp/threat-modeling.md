# Threat Model Analysis for guard/guard

## Threat: [Malicious Guardfile Modification](./threats/malicious_guardfile_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `.Guardfile`. They modify it to inject malicious commands that are executed by `guard` whenever a watched file changes. This directly leverages `guard`'s configuration mechanism to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the development environment or CI/CD pipeline. Potential for data breaches, code injection into the application, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Guard::Dsl` (parses and interprets the `.Guardfile`), `Guard::Runner` (executes the Guard tasks defined in the `.Guardfile`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict write permissions to the `.Guardfile` to authorized users only using file system permissions.
*   Implement version control for the `.Guardfile` and require code reviews for changes.
*   Consider using configuration management tools to manage and deploy the `.Guardfile`.
*   Regularly audit changes to the `.Guardfile`.

## Threat: [Execution of Arbitrary Commands via Guard Tasks](./threats/execution_of_arbitrary_commands_via_guard_tasks.md)

**Description:** A developer or attacker configures a Guard task to execute shell commands without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the system whenever the associated file change event occurs, directly through `guard`'s task execution capabilities.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service, depending on the privileges of the user running Guard.

**Affected Component:** `Guard::Plugin` (defines the actions to be taken), `Guard::Runner` (executes the plugin actions, including shell commands).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using shell commands directly within Guard tasks where possible. Prefer using the functionality provided by specific Guard plugins.
*   If shell commands are necessary, carefully sanitize and validate any input used in the command.
*   Restrict the privileges of the user running Guard to the minimum necessary.
*   Regularly review the commands executed by Guard tasks.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Due to Improper Guard Execution](./threats/privilege_escalation_due_to_improper_guard_execution.md)

**Description:** If `guard` is run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root or administrator), any command executed by Guard tasks will also inherit those privileges. An attacker who can manipulate the `.Guardfile` or trigger a malicious task through `guard` could then execute commands with elevated privileges, potentially gaining full control of the system. This directly involves how `guard` executes commands based on its own configuration and the user's privileges.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the system running Guard.

**Affected Component:** `Guard::Runner` (executes tasks with the permissions of the running process).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Run `guard` with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root or with administrator privileges unless absolutely required.
*   If elevated privileges are necessary, implement strict controls on who can modify the `.Guardfile` and define Guard tasks. Thoroughly review all Guard configurations.
