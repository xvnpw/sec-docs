## Attack Tree Path: [Gaining Unauthorized Admin Access](./attack_tree_paths/gaining_unauthorized_admin_access.md)

**Gaining Unauthorized Admin Access:**
* **Exploiting Default Credentials:** Attackers attempt to log in using common default usernames and passwords that might not have been changed during the initial setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Code via Admin Panel Features](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_code_via_admin_panel_features.md)

**Injecting Malicious Code via Admin Panel Features:**
* **Exploiting Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into fields like product descriptions or category names. When an administrator views these pages, the script executes, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the admin, or redirect them to malicious sites.
* **Exploiting Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions that are processed on the server. If successful, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control.
* **Exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload functionalities:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, scripts) through admin panel features. If the server does not properly validate and sanitize these uploads, the attacker can execute these files and gain control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Spree Extension/Gem Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_spree_extensiongem_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploiting Spree Extension/Gem Vulnerabilities:**
* **Identifying and Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Installed Spree Extensions:** Attackers identify publicly known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Spree extensions (gems) used by the application. They then leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or steal data. This often involves researching known vulnerabilities in specific gem versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating Payment Information during Checkout](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_payment_information_during_checkout.md)

**Manipulating Payment Information during Checkout:** Attackers attempt to intercept and modify payment-related data during the checkout process. This could involve altering the payment amount, changing the recipient account, or bypassing payment verification steps. This often targets vulnerabilities in how Spree integrates with payment gateways.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting API endpoints susceptible to SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_api_endpoints_susceptible_to_sql_injection.md)

**Exploiting API endpoints susceptible to SQL Injection:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries within API requests. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize these queries, the attacker can directly interact with the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the search query processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_the_search_query_processing.md)

**Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the search query processing:** Similar to API SQL injection, attackers inject malicious SQL code into search terms. If the application doesn't properly handle these inputs, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Uploading files that can be executed on the server](./attack_tree_paths/uploading_files_that_can_be_executed_on_the_server.md)

**Uploading files that can be executed on the server:** Attackers upload files with executable extensions (e.g., .php, .rb) through asset upload features. If the server allows execution of these files, the attacker can gain a foothold on the server and potentially escalate their access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

**Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed):**  A straightforward attack where attackers use common default credentials to gain immediate administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in admin forms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_admin_forms.md)

**Exploit Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in admin forms:** Allows attackers to compromise administrator accounts and perform privileged actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in admin panel features](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_admin_panel_features.md)

**Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in admin panel features:** Grants attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code directly on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in file upload functionalities within the admin panel](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_file_upload_functionalities_within_the_admin_panel.md)

**Exploit vulnerabilities in file upload functionalities within the admin panel:** Provides a direct method for attackers to upload and execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Spree Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_spree_extensions.md)

**Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Spree Extensions:** Highlights the risk associated with using third-party code and the importance of keeping extensions updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API endpoints susceptible to SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_endpoints_susceptible_to_sql_injection.md)

**Exploit API endpoints susceptible to SQL Injection:** A direct route to accessing and manipulating sensitive data stored in the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the search query processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_the_search_query_processing.md)

**Exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the search query processing:**  Another entry point for attackers to interact with the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Payment Information during Checkout](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_payment_information_during_checkout.md)

**Manipulate Payment Information during Checkout:** Directly targets the financial aspects of the application, allowing attackers to steal money.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload files that can be executed on the server (e.g., PHP, Ruby scripts)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_files_that_can_be_executed_on_the_server__e_g___php__ruby_scripts_.md)

**Upload files that can be executed on the server (e.g., PHP, Ruby scripts):** Provides a crucial initial step for attackers to establish persistence and further compromise the system.
