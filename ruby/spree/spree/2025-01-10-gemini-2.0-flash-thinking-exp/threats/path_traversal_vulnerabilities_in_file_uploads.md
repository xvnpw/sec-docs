## Deep Dive Analysis: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Uploads in Spree

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Uploads" threat within the Spree e-commerce platform. It expands on the initial threat description, outlining the technical details, potential attack vectors, and offering comprehensive mitigation strategies tailored to a development team working with Spree.

**1. Threat Name:** Path Traversal in File Uploads (also known as Directory Traversal)

**2. Description:**

This vulnerability arises when the application's file upload functionality doesn't adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied filenames or the target upload path. Attackers can manipulate these inputs to include path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) or absolute paths, allowing them to write uploaded files to locations outside the intended upload directory.

**How it Works:**

* **Exploiting Relative Paths:** Attackers can embed sequences like `../` within the filename. When the application attempts to save the file using the unsanitized filename, each `../` moves the target directory one level up in the file system hierarchy. By repeating this sequence, an attacker can navigate to arbitrary directories.
* **Exploiting Absolute Paths:**  In some cases, the application might directly use the user-provided filename (or a portion of it) to construct the full file path. An attacker could provide an absolute path like `/etc/cron.d/malicious_job` as the filename, potentially overwriting critical system files.
* **Encoding Variations:** Attackers might use URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f`) or Unicode encoding to bypass basic filtering mechanisms.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine Spree's file upload logic constructs the save path like this:

```ruby
upload_dir = Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads')
filename = params[:file].original_filename
filepath = File.join(upload_dir, filename)
File.open(filepath, 'wb') { |f| f.write(params[:file].read) }
```

If an attacker uploads a file with the name `../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job`, the resulting `filepath` would be:

```
/path/to/spree/public/uploads/../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job
```

After path normalization, this resolves to `/etc/cron.d/malicious_job`, allowing the attacker to write to a critical system directory.

**3. Impact:**

The impact of a successful path traversal attack can be severe, potentially leading to:

* **Overwriting Critical System Files:** Attackers could overwrite configuration files (e.g., web server configuration, database credentials), system binaries, or initialization scripts. This can lead to denial of service, system instability, or complete system compromise.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. Attackers can upload malicious executable files (e.g., web shells, scripts) to web-accessible directories or system directories that are executed by scheduled tasks. This grants them complete control over the server.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially overwrite or modify sensitive data files if they know their location.
* **Website Defacement:** By overwriting index files or other publicly accessible resources, attackers can deface the website.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to upload files that, when executed, run with elevated privileges, allowing them to gain further access.

**4. Affected Component:**

The primary affected component is **Spree's file upload handling logic**. This encompasses:

* **Controllers:**  The controllers that handle file uploads, likely within the admin panel or potentially customer-facing features (e.g., product image uploads, user avatars).
* **Models:**  Potentially models that manage file attachments or storage.
* **Libraries/Gems:** Any libraries or gems used for file processing and storage (e.g., `Paperclip`, `Active Storage` if configured to use local disk, custom upload implementations).
* **Storage Mechanism:** The underlying storage mechanism (local filesystem, cloud storage) is indirectly affected, as the vulnerability lies in how the path to the storage is constructed.

**To pinpoint the exact vulnerable code, the development team needs to review:**

* **All controllers and actions that handle file uploads.** Look for code that directly uses `params[:file].original_filename` or similar user-provided input to construct file paths.
* **Any custom file upload implementations.**
* **The configuration of file storage mechanisms.**  Even if using `Active Storage`, improper configuration or custom upload logic can introduce vulnerabilities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various means:

* **Direct Manipulation of Filename during Upload:**  The most common method is to directly modify the filename field in the HTTP request when uploading a file.
* **Intercepting and Modifying Upload Requests:** Attackers can use proxy tools (like Burp Suite) to intercept the upload request and modify the filename before it reaches the server.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Client-Side JavaScript:** If client-side JavaScript handles filename processing before the upload, vulnerabilities there could be exploited to inject malicious paths.
* **Exploiting Other Application Vulnerabilities:**  In some cases, other vulnerabilities (like Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) could be leveraged to inject malicious file uploads.

**6. Example Attack Scenario (Focusing on Spree Context):**

Let's assume Spree's admin panel allows administrators to upload product images.

1. **Attacker identifies the file upload endpoint:** They analyze the Spree admin interface and find the URL responsible for handling product image uploads (e.g., `/admin/products/:id/images`).
2. **Attacker crafts a malicious file:** They create a simple PHP web shell named `evil.php`.
3. **Attacker manipulates the filename:** Using a browser's developer tools or a proxy, they intercept the file upload request and change the `filename` parameter to `../../../../public/uploads/evil.php`.
4. **Spree's vulnerable code saves the file:** If the Spree code doesn't properly sanitize the filename, it will attempt to save the file to the calculated path.
5. **Web shell is accessible:** The file `evil.php` is now located in the `public/uploads` directory, which is likely web-accessible.
6. **Attacker executes the web shell:** The attacker can now access `https://yourspreeinstance.com/uploads/evil.php` and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**7. Risk Severity:** **Critical**

This severity is justified due to the potential for:

* **Complete system compromise (RCE).**
* **Significant data breaches and manipulation.**
* **Severe disruption of service.**
* **Reputational damage.**

**8. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Spree-Specific):**

The following mitigation strategies should be implemented within Spree's file upload handling:

* **Avoid Using User-Supplied Filenames Directly:**
    * **Generate unique, unpredictable filenames server-side:** Instead of relying on `params[:file].original_filename`, generate a unique filename using a UUID, timestamp, or a combination thereof.
    * **Store the original filename separately:** If the original filename needs to be preserved, store it in the database associated with the uploaded file metadata, but never use it directly in the file path.
    * **Example (Conceptual Ruby):**
      ```ruby
      def create_unique_filename(original_filename)
        extension = File.extname(original_filename)
        "#{SecureRandom.uuid}#{extension}"
      end

      uploaded_file = params[:file]
      unique_filename = create_unique_filename(uploaded_file.original_filename)
      upload_dir = Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads')
      filepath = File.join(upload_dir, unique_filename)
      File.open(filepath, 'wb') { |f| f.write(uploaded_file.read) }
      ```

* **Enforce a Strict Upload Directory and Prevent Path Traversal Characters:**
    * **Define a dedicated, controlled upload directory:**  Clearly define the intended directory for file uploads and ensure all uploads are confined to this location.
    * **Sanitize filenames:**  Implement robust input validation to remove or replace path traversal characters (`../`, `..\\`), absolute paths (`/`, `C:\`), and potentially other dangerous characters.
    * **Use `File.basename`:** This Ruby method extracts the filename from a path, effectively stripping any directory information.
    * **Example (Conceptual Ruby):**
      ```ruby
      upload_dir = Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads')
      filename = File.basename(params[:file].original_filename) # Removes path components

      # Further sanitization (e.g., removing non-alphanumeric characters)
      sanitized_filename = filename.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/, '')

      filepath = File.join(upload_dir, sanitized_filename)
      File.open(filepath, 'wb') { |f| f.write(params[:file].read) }
      ```

* **Path Canonicalization:**
    * **Resolve symbolic links and relative paths:** Use functions like `File.realpath` in Ruby to resolve the actual path of the uploaded file after it's saved. This can help detect if an attacker managed to bypass initial sanitization.
    * **Compare the resolved path with the intended upload directory:** Ensure the resolved path falls within the allowed upload directory.

* **Permissions and Least Privilege:**
    * **Ensure the web server process has minimal write permissions:** The web server user should only have write access to the designated upload directory and not to other sensitive areas of the file system.
    * **Consider separate storage users:** For increased security, use a dedicated user account for file storage operations.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a strict CSP:** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of uploaded malicious scripts by preventing their execution within the browser context. However, CSP won't prevent server-side execution.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular code reviews:** Specifically focus on file upload handling logic.
    * **Perform penetration testing:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

* **Specific Considerations for Spree:**
    * **Review Spree's built-in file upload mechanisms:** Understand how Spree handles file uploads for different entities (products, variants, etc.).
    * **Examine custom extensions and integrations:**  Third-party extensions might introduce their own file upload functionalities that are vulnerable.
    * **Consider using `Active Storage` securely:** If using `Active Storage`, ensure its configurations are secure and prevent direct access to the underlying storage paths. Leverage its built-in features for filename hashing and secure URL generation.
    * **Implement robust authentication and authorization:** Ensure only authorized users can access file upload functionalities.

**9. Development Team Actions:**

* **Identify all file upload points within the Spree application.**
* **Thoroughly review the code responsible for handling file uploads.**
* **Implement the mitigation strategies outlined above.**
* **Write unit and integration tests to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.**
* **Conduct security testing specifically targeting file upload vulnerabilities.**
* **Educate developers on secure file upload practices.**
* **Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating security measures.**

**10. Conclusion:**

Path traversal vulnerabilities in file uploads pose a significant threat to Spree applications. By understanding the attack mechanisms and implementing comprehensive mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. Prioritizing secure coding practices and regular security assessments is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the Spree platform and its data. Addressing this "Critical" severity threat should be a high priority for the development team.
