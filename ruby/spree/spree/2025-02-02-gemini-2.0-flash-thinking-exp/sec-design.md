# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - Product catalog management: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date product information.
  - Order processing: Securely and reliably processing customer orders from placement to fulfillment.
  - Payment processing: Securely handling customer payment information and transactions.
  - Customer account management: Securely managing customer accounts and personal information.
  - Inventory management: Tracking and managing product inventory levels.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Name, address, email, phone number, order history. Sensitivity: High. Requires strong protection due to privacy regulations and potential for identity theft.
  - Payment card information (PCI): Credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes. Sensitivity: Critical. Requires strict PCI DSS compliance and strong encryption.
  - Administrator credentials: Usernames and passwords for platform administrators. Sensitivity: Critical. Compromise can lead to full platform control.
  - Product information: Product descriptions, prices, images. Sensitivity: Medium. Important for business operations and marketing.
  - Order data: Order details, shipping information, transaction history. Sensitivity: Medium. Important for business operations and customer service.
  - Analytics data: Website traffic, user behavior data. Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Can be used for business insights and marketing, but less sensitive than PII or PCI.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA)?
  - What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the platform?
  - Are there any specific third-party integrations planned or in use?
- Assumptions:
  - The project will be deployed in a cloud environment for scalability and resilience.
  - Security is a high priority for the project due to the nature of e-commerce and handling sensitive data.
  - Standard security best practices for web applications and cloud deployments will be followed.
  - The organization using Spree Commerce has some level of technical expertise to manage and maintain the platform.
  - The platform will handle customer PII and potentially payment card information, requiring strong security measures.
