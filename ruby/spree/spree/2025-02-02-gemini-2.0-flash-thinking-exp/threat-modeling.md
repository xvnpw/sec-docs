# Threat Model Analysis for spree/spree

## Threat: [Default Admin Credentials](./threats/default_admin_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Spree admin panel using default or commonly known credentials. Successful login grants full admin access, allowing complete control over the store.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Spree store. Attackers can access and modify all data, including customer information, orders, products, and configurations. They can also potentially gain control of the underlying server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Affected Spree Component:**  Admin Panel Authentication (Spree Core)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change default admin credentials during Spree installation.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all admin users.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Spree's session handling to hijack user sessions. This could involve session fixation, session ID prediction, or cross-site scripting (XSS) to steal session cookies. Once hijacked, attackers can impersonate legitimate users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, including admin accounts. Attackers can perform actions as the compromised user, potentially leading to data breaches, fraudulent orders, or administrative actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Affected Spree Component:** Session Management (Spree Core, Ruby on Rails)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Spree and Ruby on Rails are updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Configure session settings for security (e.g., `secure: true`, `http_only: true` flags for cookies).
*   Implement session timeouts and regeneration after critical actions.

## Threat: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass](./threats/role-based_access_control__rbac__bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to circumvent Spree's permission system to access resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use. This could involve manipulating request parameters or exploiting logic flaws in permission checks within Spree's code.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation. Users with limited permissions can gain access to sensitive data or administrative functions, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Affected Spree Component:**  Authorization Framework (Spree Core, CanCanCan gem)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and audit Spree's permission system, especially custom roles and permissions.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent parameter manipulation.
*   Regularly review and update user roles and permissions within Spree.

## Threat: [API Authentication Weaknesses](./threats/api_authentication_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** If the Spree API is enabled, attackers target vulnerabilities in its authentication mechanisms. This could include brute-forcing API keys, exploiting weaknesses in OAuth implementation within Spree's API, or bypassing authentication due to misconfigurations in Spree API setup.

**Impact:** Data breaches through API access, manipulation of store data via API calls (e.g., price changes, order modifications), unauthorized actions performed programmatically via Spree API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Affected Spree Component:**  Spree API (Spree API gem)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong API authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for the Spree API.
*   Securely store and manage API keys (avoid hardcoding, use environment variables or secrets management).
*   Rate limit API requests to prevent brute-force attacks and denial of service against the Spree API.

## Threat: [Payment Gateway Integration Vulnerabilities](./threats/payment_gateway_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Spree's integration with payment gateways or in the gateway APIs themselves. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks, injection vulnerabilities in Spree's payment processing logic, or flaws in how Spree handles payment responses.

**Impact:** Financial loss due to fraudulent transactions, data breaches of payment card details processed through Spree, reputational damage, PCI DSS compliance violations, legal repercussions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Affected Spree Component:** Payment Processing Modules (Spree Gateway, ActiveMerchant gem, specific gateway integrations within Spree)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use well-vetted and reputable payment gateways integrated with Spree.
*   Keep Spree and payment gateway integrations up-to-date with security patches.
*   Regularly audit payment processing flows within Spree for security vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce HTTPS for all payment-related communication within Spree.
*   Adhere strictly to PCI DSS guidelines when handling payment data in Spree.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Payment Data (Configuration)](./threats/insecure_handling_of_payment_data__configuration_.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration of Spree or payment gateway settings leads to insecure storage or transmission of sensitive payment data. This could include logging payment card details by Spree, storing unencrypted data within Spree's database, or transmitting data over insecure channels (non-HTTPS) due to Spree misconfiguration.

**Impact:** Data breaches of payment card details, PCI DSS compliance violations due to Spree's handling of data, legal repercussions, reputational damage, financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Affected Spree Component:** Payment Configuration (Spree Core, Spree Gateway, configuration files related to payment processing in Spree)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly adhere to PCI DSS guidelines when configuring Spree for payment processing.
*   Properly configure Spree and payment gateway settings according to security best practices.
*   Avoid storing sensitive payment data locally within Spree if not absolutely necessary and only in a PCI-compliant manner.
*   Utilize tokenization and encryption for payment data within Spree's payment processing flows.

## Threat: [Order Data Exposure](./threats/order_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to order data managed by Spree. This could involve SQL injection in Spree queries, insecure direct object references (IDOR) in Spree's order viewing functionality, or RBAC bypass to access order details, customer information, and shipping addresses within Spree.

**Impact:** Data breaches of customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored in Spree's order data, privacy violations, reputational damage, potential legal repercussions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Affected Spree Component:** Order Management Module (Spree Core, Spree Backend)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls for order data within Spree.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the Spree application.
*   Regularly audit access to order data and implement logging within Spree.
*   Sanitize and validate input to prevent injection vulnerabilities in Spree's order management features.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Spree Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_spree_extensions.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in third-party Spree extensions (gems). These vulnerabilities are within the extension's code and directly impact the Spree application. Exploitation depends on the specific vulnerability and the extension's functionality within Spree.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability and the extension. Could include data breaches, code execution within Spree, denial of service affecting the Spree store, or other forms of compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on extension and vulnerability)

**Affected Spree Component:** Spree Extensions (Third-party gems, Spree extension loading mechanism)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and select Spree extensions from trusted sources.
*   Regularly update Spree extensions to the latest versions.
*   Conduct security audits of installed Spree extensions, especially before deploying to production.
*   Implement a process for managing and monitoring vulnerabilities in Spree extensions.
