# Threat Model Analysis for spree/spree

## Threat: [Malicious Product Data Injection](./threats/malicious_product_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to product creation or editing interfaces (e.g., through a compromised admin account or exploiting vulnerabilities in Spree's admin forms) injects malicious scripts or code into product descriptions, names, or other fields. This code is then executed when other users view these product pages.

**Impact:**
*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of users viewing the affected product pages. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
*   Phishing attacks by embedding malicious links within product descriptions.
*   Website defacement by injecting HTML to alter the appearance of product pages.

**Component Affected:**
*   `Spree::Admin::ProductsController` (specifically the create and update actions).
*   Product data models (e.g., `Spree::Product`, `Spree::ProductProperty`).
*   View templates within the Spree core rendering product information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all product data input fields in the Spree admin interface. Use a library like `Rails::Html::Sanitizer` to strip potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
*   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.
*   Regularly audit admin user accounts and enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
*   Implement proper access controls within Spree to restrict who can create and edit product information.

## Threat: [Price Manipulation](./threats/price_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Spree's core pricing logic or access controls to modify product prices, either directly through Spree's admin interfaces (if compromised) or by manipulating data submitted during the checkout process (if Spree's validation is weak).

**Impact:**
*   Customers being able to purchase products at significantly reduced or even zero cost, leading to financial losses for the store owner.
*   Reputational damage if the price discrepancies are noticed by other customers.

**Component Affected:**
*   `Spree::Admin::ProductsController` (price update action).
*   `Spree::ProductsController` (potentially during add to cart or checkout if Spree's validation is insufficient).
*   `Spree::Price` model and associated logic within the Spree core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict authorization checks on price modification actions in the Spree admin interface.
*   Validate prices on the server-side within Spree's checkout process, ensuring they haven't been tampered with on the client-side.
*   Use database-level constraints within Spree's schema to enforce valid price ranges if applicable.
*   Regularly monitor product prices for unexpected changes.

## Threat: [Order Tampering](./threats/order_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Spree's core order processing workflow to modify existing orders after they have been placed. This could involve changing shipping addresses, product quantities, or applied discounts through Spree's interfaces or by manipulating data before it's finalized by Spree.

**Impact:**
*   Orders being shipped to incorrect addresses, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential financial losses.
*   Attackers receiving products they did not pay for or manipulating order details for personal gain.
*   Disruption of order fulfillment processes managed by Spree.

**Component Affected:**
*   `Spree::OrdersController` (potentially specific actions like update within Spree's core).
*   `Spree::Admin::OrdersController` (order editing actions within Spree's admin).
*   `Spree::Order` model and associated state machine logic within the Spree core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict authorization checks on order modification actions within Spree, especially after an order has reached a certain state (e.g., "processing").
*   Log all order modifications within Spree with details of who made the changes and when.
*   Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of order data if it's transmitted or stored in a way that could be tampered with by bypassing Spree's internal mechanisms.
*   Limit the ability to modify orders after they are placed within Spree's workflow, or require additional authentication for such changes.

## Threat: [Payment Manipulation (Beyond Standard Payment Gateway Issues)](./threats/payment_manipulation__beyond_standard_payment_gateway_issues_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Spree's core payment processing logic itself (outside of the secure communication with the payment gateway) to manipulate payment amounts or bypass payment requirements. This could involve tampering with data handled by Spree during the checkout process before it reaches the gateway.

**Impact:**
*   Orders being placed without proper payment, leading to financial losses for the store owner.
*   Potential for fraudulent transactions processed through Spree.

**Component Affected:**
*   `Spree::CheckoutController` (payment step within Spree's core).
*   `Spree::Payment` model and associated logic within the Spree core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Perform all critical payment calculations and validations on the server-side within Spree, not relying on client-side data.
*   Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) is enforced throughout Spree's checkout process.
*   Thoroughly review and test Spree's core payment processing logic for security vulnerabilities.
*   Implement server-side validation of payment amounts within Spree before submitting them to the payment gateway.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Spree Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_spree_roles.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Spree's core role-based access control system to gain unauthorized administrative privileges. This could involve manipulating user roles directly in the database (if access is gained) or exploiting flaws in Spree's role assignment logic.

**Impact:**
*   Full control over the store, allowing the attacker to modify data, create or delete users, change configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code if extensions are involved.
*   Significant data breaches and financial losses.
*   Complete compromise of the e-commerce platform managed by Spree.

**Component Affected:**
*   `Spree::Role` model and associated logic within the Spree core.
*   `Spree::User` model and role assignment methods within the Spree core.
*   Authorization checks throughout the Spree application (e.g., using `cancancan`).
*   Spree's admin interface controllers and actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit user roles and permissions within Spree.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege within Spree, granting users only the necessary permissions.
*   Thoroughly review and test Spree's core role management logic.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms throughout the Spree application.
