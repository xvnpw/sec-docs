## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (Spree Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__spree_specific_.md)

* **Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Spree, like many applications, might have default credentials for initial setup or administrative accounts. If these are not changed, attackers can easily gain full control.
* **Gain Access to Admin Panel [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of authentication flaws can lead to gaining access to the administrative panel, granting extensive control over the application.
* **Exploit Insecure Password Reset Mechanism:**
    * Description: Flaws in the password reset process (e.g., predictable reset tokens, lack of email verification, account takeover vulnerabilities) can allow attackers to gain access to user accounts.
* **Gain Access to User Accounts:**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of password reset vulnerabilities allows attackers to compromise individual user accounts.
* **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability within Spree Roles/Permissions:**
    * Description: Vulnerabilities in how Spree manages user roles and permissions could allow an attacker with limited access to elevate their privileges to gain administrative control.
* **Gain Access to Higher Privileged Resources [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful privilege escalation grants access to resources and functionalities intended for higher-privileged users, potentially including administrative functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Payment Processing Vulnerabilities (Spree Integration Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_payment_processing_vulnerabilities__spree_integration_specific_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerability in Spree's Payment Gateway Integration Logic:**
    * Description: Flaws in how Spree integrates with payment gateways (e.g., improper handling of callbacks, insecure communication, lack of input validation) can be exploited to manipulate order totals, payment status, or bypass payment processing altogether.
* **Manipulate Order Totals or Payment Status [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of payment gateway integration flaws can allow attackers to alter order amounts or mark orders as paid without proper authorization, leading to financial loss.
* **Exploit Vulnerability in Stored Payment Information Handling (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: If Spree is configured to store payment information (which is generally discouraged due to PCI DSS compliance), vulnerabilities in how this data is stored and accessed (e.g., weak encryption, insecure access controls) can lead to sensitive data breaches.
* **Access Sensitive Payment Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in stored payment information handling can lead to the exposure of highly sensitive financial data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (Spree Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__spree_specific_.md)

* **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability in Spree ORM Queries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: If Spree's codebase contains instances where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to access, modify, or delete data in the database.
* **Access or Modify Sensitive Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful SQL injection attacks can grant attackers direct access to the application's database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Spree Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__spree_specific_.md)

* **Exploit Misconfigured Spree Settings Exposing Sensitive Information [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Incorrectly configured Spree settings (e.g., exposing API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information in configuration files or environment variables) can provide attackers with valuable information for further attacks.
* **Gain Access to Internal Details or Credentials:**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of misconfigurations can reveal sensitive internal details or credentials that can be used to further compromise the application or related systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (Spree API Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__spree_api_specific_.md)

* **Exploit Authentication Bypass in Spree API Endpoints:**
    * Description: Vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanisms for Spree's API endpoints can allow attackers to bypass authentication and access protected resources or perform actions without proper authorization.
* **Access or Modify Data Without Proper Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Successful authentication bypass in the API allows attackers to interact with API endpoints as if they were authorized users, potentially accessing or modifying sensitive data.
