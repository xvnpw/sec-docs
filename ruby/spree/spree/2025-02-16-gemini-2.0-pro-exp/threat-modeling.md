# Threat Model Analysis for spree/spree

## Threat: [Malicious Spree Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_spree_extension_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An administrator is tricked into installing a malicious Spree extension (gem) from an untrusted source, or a legitimate extension repository is compromised. The malicious extension contains code designed to steal data, modify orders, inject malicious scripts, or establish a backdoor for persistent access. The attacker might employ social engineering, phishing, or exploit vulnerabilities in the extension upload/installation process within Spree.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (customer PII, order details, potentially payment tokens if handled insecurely by the extension).
        *   Financial loss (fraudulent orders, refunds initiated by the attacker).
        *   Severe reputational damage.
        *   Complete system compromise (backdoor access, remote code execution).
    *   **Spree Component Affected:** `spree_core` (extension loading and execution mechanism), `spree_backend` (extension management interface), and potentially *any* Spree component that interacts with the malicious extension.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Extension Sourcing:** *Only* install extensions from the official Spree extension directory or highly reputable, thoroughly vetted sources.  Never install extensions from unknown or untrusted websites.
        *   **Mandatory Code Review:** Before installing *any* extension, a qualified developer *must* thoroughly review its source code for suspicious patterns.  Focus on network requests, data handling, authentication/authorization logic, and any system calls.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review all installed extensions and their versions, checking against known vulnerability databases.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Spree application with the least necessary system privileges to limit the damage a compromised extension can cause.

## Threat: [Unauthorized API Access and Data Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_api_access_and_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Spree API (v1 or v2) due to weak authentication (easily guessable API keys), leaked API keys (e.g., accidentally committed to a public repository), or a vulnerability in Spree's API authentication/authorization logic. The attacker can then create, read, update, or delete data, including products, orders, users, and potentially payment information (depending on how the payment gateway is integrated and if tokens are stored insecurely). They might use brute-force attacks, exploit session management flaws, or leverage other vulnerabilities to obtain valid API credentials.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (customer PII, order details, potentially payment data).
        *   Financial loss (fraudulent orders, price manipulation, unauthorized refunds).
        *   Significant reputational damage.
        *   Service disruption (if the attacker deletes data or modifies configurations).
    *   **Spree Component Affected:** `spree_api` (v1 and v2 endpoints), `spree_core` (authentication and authorization mechanisms related to API access).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong, Unique API Keys:** Use strong, randomly generated API keys that are difficult to guess.
        *   **API Key Rotation:** Implement a mandatory process for regularly rotating API keys (e.g., every 90 days).
        *   **Strict Rate Limiting:** Enforce strict rate limiting on *all* API requests to prevent brute-force attacks and mitigate the impact of compromised keys.
        *   **Thorough Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* input received via the API to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
        *   **Granular Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization rules for API access. Different API keys should have different, limited permission sets based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   **HTTPS Only:** *Always* enforce HTTPS for all API communication to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   **API Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor API usage for suspicious activity, such as unusual request patterns, access from unexpected IP addresses, or a high volume of failed authentication attempts. Set up alerts for these events.

## Threat: [Payment Gateway Configuration Tampering](./threats/payment_gateway_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Spree backend (e.g., through a compromised administrator account, a successful phishing attack, or a vulnerability in the backend itself) and maliciously modifies the payment gateway configuration.  They could change the API keys or merchant account details to redirect payments to their own account, disable security features like 3D Secure (increasing the risk of fraudulent transactions), or alter the allowed payment methods to facilitate fraud.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Severe financial loss (stolen payments redirected to the attacker).
        *   Extensive reputational damage.
        *   Potential legal and regulatory consequences (e.g., PCI DSS violations).
    *   **Spree Component Affected:** `spree_backend` (payment method configuration interface), `spree_core` (payment processing logic), and the specific payment gateway integration Spree components (e.g., `spree_gateway`, or third-party gateway extensions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for *all* administrator accounts, without exception.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Require strong, unique passwords for all administrator accounts, and enforce regular password changes.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant administrator accounts only the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Separate roles for managing payment configurations from other administrative tasks.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular, scheduled audits of payment gateway configurations, comparing them against known-good configurations.
        *   **Change Alerting:** Implement real-time alerts for *any* changes made to payment gateway configurations.
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store payment gateway credentials (API keys, secrets) securely, *never* directly in the Spree database or configuration files. Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Spree Core or Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_spree_core_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in Spree's core code, the Ruby on Rails framework itself, or any of Spree's gem dependencies. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to take complete control of the server, steal data, or disrupt service. The attacker might use publicly available exploits (for known vulnerabilities) or develop their own exploits (for zero-day vulnerabilities).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise (full control of the server).
        *   Extensive data breach (all data accessible to the attacker).
        *   Complete service disruption.
        *   Severe reputational damage.
    *   **Spree Component Affected:** Potentially *any* Spree component, depending on the specific vulnerability and its location.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Spree, Rails, and all gem dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools like Bundler Audit, Brakeman, and OWASP Dependency-Check.
        *   **Immediate Patch Management:** Apply security patches for Spree, Rails, and all gems *immediately* upon release. Establish a robust and rapid patch management process.
        *   **Continuous Dependency Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for newly disclosed vulnerabilities in all dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists and use automated tools.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to help mitigate common web application attacks and potentially block exploits targeting known vulnerabilities, providing an additional layer of defense.  However, a WAF is *not* a substitute for patching.
