# Attack Surface Analysis for spree/spree

## Attack Surface: [Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Spree extensions (gems) introduce security risks due to varying code quality, outdated dependencies, and potential logic flaws.
    *   **Spree Contribution:** Spree's core design *actively promotes* extensibility via a large ecosystem of community-developed extensions.  This architectural choice *directly* increases the attack surface. Spree's reliance on the community for functionality means quality control is decentralized.
    *   **Example:** An extension designed to add a new payment method contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in its configuration panel within the Spree admin. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing admin session cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer data, order details, payment information), unauthorized access to the admin panel, complete site takeover, code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Vetting:** *Thoroughly* vet *every* extension before installation.  Examine the source code (if available), check the author's reputation and the extension's update history, and search for any reported security vulnerabilities.  Prioritize well-maintained, actively developed extensions from reputable sources.
        *   **Automated Dependency Auditing:** Use tools like `bundler-audit` to *automatically and regularly* check for vulnerable dependencies within *all* installed extensions. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Least Privilege (for Custom Extensions):** If developing custom extensions, grant them *only* the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting broad database access or administrative privileges.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** For custom extensions, implement *mandatory* code reviews with a strong security focus.  Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Aggressive Update Policy:** Keep Spree and *all* extensions updated to their *latest* versions.  Subscribe to security mailing lists and immediately apply security patches.
        *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor extensions for unusual behavior, errors, or unexpected resource consumption that might indicate a compromise.

## Attack Surface: [API (v2) Security](./attack_surfaces/api__v2__security.md)

*   **Description:** Spree's RESTful API (v2) provides programmatic access to core platform functionality.  Improperly secured API endpoints are a direct attack vector.
    *   **Spree Contribution:** Spree *intentionally* exposes a broad and powerful API to facilitate integrations and custom front-ends.  This design choice *directly* creates a large attack surface that must be meticulously secured. The API's design, while powerful, inherently increases risk.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint that allows updating product inventory does not properly enforce authorization checks.  An attacker with a low-privilege user account (or even an unauthenticated user, if authentication is flawed) could use the API to manipulate inventory levels, potentially causing significant business disruption.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer data, order details, product information), unauthorized modification of data (orders, products, inventory, user accounts), denial-of-service, potential for code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Authentication (Beyond API Keys):** Implement strong authentication using industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.  Do *not* rely solely on API keys for authentication.
        *   **Strict API Key Management:** Generate strong, unique API keys.  Implement a robust key rotation policy.  Store keys *securely* using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  *Never* store keys in code or version control.
        *   **Fine-Grained Authorization (Per Endpoint):** Implement granular authorization checks within *each* API endpoint.  Ensure that users can only access resources and perform actions they are explicitly permitted to.  Leverage Spree's built-in roles and permissions system, but *validate* its effectiveness for each API endpoint.
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* input received through API endpoints.  Use strong typing, parameter whitelisting, and appropriate sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, command injection, etc.).
        *   **Mandatory Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on *all* API endpoints to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service.  Configure rate limits appropriately for each endpoint based on its intended use.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode *all* data returned by the API to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
        *   **Comprehensive API Security Testing:** Thoroughly test API endpoints for security vulnerabilities using a combination of automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) and manual penetration testing.  Focus on authentication, authorization, input validation, and error handling.

## Attack Surface: [Payment Gateway Integration Risks](./attack_surfaces/payment_gateway_integration_risks.md)

*   **Description:** Spree's reliance on external payment gateways for transaction processing introduces risks related to credential theft, data interception, and vulnerabilities in gateway libraries.
    *   **Spree Contribution:** Spree's architecture *requires* integration with third-party payment gateways.  This dependency *directly* introduces an attack surface that is partially outside of Spree's direct control. The choice of gateway and the integration method are critical.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in the Ruby library used to integrate Spree with a specific payment gateway.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to intercept payment data or potentially execute arbitrary code on the Spree server.
    *   **Impact:** Financial losses, reputational damage, legal liability, PCI DSS compliance violations, potential for data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage (Vault):** Store payment gateway credentials *exclusively* in a secure, dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  *Never* store credentials in environment variables, code, or version control.
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement (Strict):** Ensure that *all* communication between Spree and the payment gateway is encrypted using HTTPS with *strong* ciphers and up-to-date TLS protocols.  Regularly verify TLS configuration.
        *   **Immediate Library Updates:** Keep the payment gateway integration libraries updated to the *absolute latest* versions.  Monitor for security advisories related to these libraries and apply patches *immediately*.
        *   **Tokenization (Mandatory):** *Always* utilize tokenization provided by the payment gateway to avoid storing sensitive card data directly on the Spree server.  This significantly reduces the impact of a potential data breach.
        *   **Strict PCI DSS Compliance:** Adhere to *all* applicable PCI DSS requirements.  Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to ensure ongoing compliance.
        *   **Fraud Monitoring and Prevention:** Implement robust fraud monitoring tools and procedures to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.  Work with the payment gateway to leverage their fraud prevention capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Compromise](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The Spree admin panel is a central control point. Compromise grants near-total control.
    *   **Spree Contribution:** Spree *provides* a powerful, centralized admin panel with extensive capabilities. This design, while convenient, *directly* creates a high-value target for attackers. The breadth of functionality within the admin panel amplifies the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker successfully guesses a weak password for an admin user account.  The attacker then logs into the admin panel and exports the entire customer database, including names, addresses, email addresses, and order history.
    *   **Impact:** Complete site takeover, data breaches (customer data, order details, potentially payment information if stored insecurely), financial losses, reputational damage, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Strong Passwords and Password Manager:** Enforce *strong*, unique passwords for *all* admin users.  *Require* the use of a password manager.
        *   **Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement and *enforce* two-factor authentication (2FA) for *all* admin accounts.  This is a *critical* defense against credential theft.
        *   **Secure Session Management:** Use secure session management practices, including short session timeouts, secure cookies (HTTPS-only, HttpOnly), and proper session invalidation after logout.
        *   **IP Whitelisting (If Feasible):** If possible, restrict access to the admin panel to specific, trusted IP addresses or ranges.  This adds a significant layer of defense.
        *   **Mandatory Admin User Security Training:** Provide *mandatory* security training to all admin users.  Cover topics such as recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks, using strong passwords, understanding the importance of 2FA, and reporting suspicious activity.
        *   **Regular Admin Account Audits:** Regularly audit admin user accounts and permissions to ensure they are appropriate and that no unauthorized accounts have been created.  Remove or disable inactive accounts promptly.
        * **Least Privilege for Admins:** Minimize the number of users with full administrative privileges. Grant only the necessary permissions to each admin user.
