# Attack Surface Analysis for simplecov-ruby/simplecov

## Attack Surface: [Instrumentation Code Injection Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/instrumentation_code_injection_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability within SimpleCov's code instrumentation process could allow for the injection of malicious code into the application's execution flow.
    * **How SimpleCov Contributes:** SimpleCov modifies the application's code at runtime to track coverage. A flaw in this modification logic could be exploited.
    * **Example:** A bug in SimpleCov's parsing or code rewriting logic could be leveraged to insert arbitrary Ruby code that gets executed when the instrumented code runs.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain control of the server or application.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review SimpleCov's source code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        * Keep SimpleCov updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes.
        * Limit the environments where SimpleCov is enabled (ideally only development and testing).

## Attack Surface: [Report Generation Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/report_generation_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in SimpleCov's report generation logic could allow for the injection of malicious scripts into the generated HTML reports.
    * **How SimpleCov Contributes:** SimpleCov generates HTML reports that display coverage data. If user-controlled data or code paths are not properly sanitized before being included in the report, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    * **Example:** If file paths or test descriptions containing malicious JavaScript are included in the report without proper encoding, viewing the report in a browser could execute that script.
    * **Impact:** If the reports are accessible to other users (even internal ones), an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browsers, leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure all data used in report generation is properly sanitized and encoded to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
        * Review SimpleCov's report generation code for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        * If possible, restrict access to the generated coverage reports to trusted users.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS attacks.
