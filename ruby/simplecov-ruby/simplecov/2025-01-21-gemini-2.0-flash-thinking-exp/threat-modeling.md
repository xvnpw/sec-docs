# Threat Model Analysis for simplecov-ruby/simplecov

## Threat: [Exposure of Source Code Snippets in Coverage Reports](./threats/exposure_of_source_code_snippets_in_coverage_reports.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to SimpleCov's generated reports (e.g., through a misconfigured web server, accidental commit to a public repository). This allows them to view snippets of uncovered code, potentially revealing sensitive logic, algorithms, or vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Attackers gain insights into the application's internals, making it easier to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Intellectual property could be exposed.

**Affected Component:** Report Generation (specifically the HTML or other report format output).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure coverage reports are generated in secure, non-publicly accessible directories.
*   Implement strict access controls on directories containing coverage reports.
*   Utilize `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to prevent accidental commit of report artifacts to version control.
*   Consider using secure artifact storage solutions for coverage reports.

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Coverage Data](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_sensitive_information_in_coverage_data.md)

**Description:** If tests inadvertently include sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) within the code being executed and measured by SimpleCov, this data could be captured in the coverage data and potentially exposed in reports or temporary files.

**Impact:** High risk of sensitive data exposure. Attackers gaining access to coverage data could directly obtain credentials or other confidential information.

**Affected Component:** Coverage Measurement (the process of tracking executed lines and their context).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review test code to ensure no sensitive information is directly embedded.
*   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for sensitive data in tests.
*   Implement mechanisms to scrub sensitive data from test outputs and logs.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Code via Configuration (Low Probability)](./threats/injection_of_malicious_code_via_configuration__low_probability_.md)

**Description:** While less likely with SimpleCov's design, if vulnerabilities exist in how SimpleCov parses or processes its configuration files (e.g., `.simplecov`), an attacker with write access to these files might be able to inject malicious code that gets executed during the coverage measurement process.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the testing environment.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading and Processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep SimpleCov updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Restrict write access to SimpleCov configuration files.
*   Regularly review SimpleCov's configuration options and ensure they are securely managed.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Report Generation](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_report_generation.md)

**Description:** If SimpleCov's report generation process has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, path traversal), an attacker might be able to craft inputs or manipulate the environment to cause the process to crash, consume excessive resources, or even execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the system generating the reports.

**Affected Component:** Report Generation Modules (e.g., HTML formatter).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep SimpleCov updated to the latest version.
*   Review SimpleCov's issue tracker for known vulnerabilities related to report generation.
*   Run report generation in a sandboxed or isolated environment.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in SimpleCov Itself (Low Probability)](./threats/malicious_code_in_simplecov_itself__low_probability_.md)

**Description:** While highly unlikely for a widely used and reputable gem, there's a theoretical risk of SimpleCov itself being compromised and containing malicious code that could be executed during the testing process.

**Impact:**  Potentially severe, including arbitrary code execution, data theft, or compromise of the development environment.

**Affected Component:** Entire SimpleCov codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Monitor SimpleCov's repository and community for any signs of compromise.
*   Use trusted sources for installing the gem (e.g., rubygems.org).
*   Consider using software composition analysis tools that can detect suspicious code patterns.
