## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit SimpleCov Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Gain File System Access -> Exploit Application Vulnerability (e.g., LFI, Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_simplecov_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_gain_file_system_access_-_exploit_4eaaa538.md)

*   **Exploit SimpleCov Configuration Vulnerabilities:**
    *   An attacker aims to manipulate SimpleCov's behavior by altering its configuration. This could involve changing output directories, including/excluding files, or potentially injecting malicious code if the configuration is processed unsafely.
*   **Gain File System Access (Critical Node):**
    *   This is a pivotal step. The attacker successfully gains access to the server's file system. This could be achieved through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself or the underlying system.
*   **Exploit Application Vulnerability (e.g., LFI, Path Traversal):**
    *   With file system access, the attacker leverages vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Path Traversal to read sensitive files, potentially including SimpleCov's configuration files, or even execute arbitrary code by including malicious files.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit SimpleCov Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables -> Application Uses Environment Variables in Unsafe Ways](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_simplecov_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_configuration_vi_d8f0ff55.md)

*   **Exploit SimpleCov Configuration Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Similar to the previous path, the attacker targets SimpleCov's configuration.
*   **Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables:**
    *   Instead of modifying files directly, the attacker injects malicious configuration values through environment variables. This could involve setting environment variables that SimpleCov reads and uses.
*   **Application Uses Environment Variables in Unsafe Ways (Critical Node):**
    *   This highlights a critical flaw in the application's design. The application unsafely uses environment variables, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or other vulnerabilities based on the attacker-controlled values.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Dependencies of SimpleCov -> Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency -> Dependency has Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_dependencies_of_simplecov_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_a_dependency_-_depende_1d7beb55.md)

*   **Exploit Dependencies of SimpleCov (Critical Node):**
    *   Attackers recognize that SimpleCov relies on other libraries (dependencies). They target vulnerabilities within these dependencies as a way to compromise the application indirectly.
*   **Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency (Critical Node):**
    *   The attacker identifies and exploits a known vulnerability in one of SimpleCov's dependencies. This could be a publicly known vulnerability or a zero-day exploit.
*   **Dependency has Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:**
    *   The exploited dependency has a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the application. This is a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploit SimpleCov's Code Execution During Testing/Development -> Inject Malicious Code into Test Suite -> Modify Test Files -> Gain File System Access](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploit_simplecov's_code_execution_during_testingdevelopment_-_inject_malicious_cod_ff22a1c8.md)

*   **Exploit SimpleCov's Code Execution During Testing/Development:**
    *   Attackers target the development or testing environment where SimpleCov is typically active. They aim to leverage SimpleCov's code instrumentation to execute malicious code.
*   **Inject Malicious Code into Test Suite:**
    *   The attacker's goal is to insert malicious code into the application's test suite. This code will be executed when the tests are run, potentially by SimpleCov during coverage analysis.
*   **Modify Test Files (Critical Node):**
    *   To inject malicious code, the attacker needs to modify the test files. This requires access to the development environment's file system.
*   **Gain File System Access (Critical Node):**
    *   As seen in other paths, gaining file system access is a crucial step. In this context, it allows the attacker to modify the test files and inject their malicious code.
