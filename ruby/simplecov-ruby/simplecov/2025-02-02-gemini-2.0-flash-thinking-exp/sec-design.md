# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `simplecov-ruby/simplecov`, provides a code coverage tool for Ruby projects. Code coverage is a metric used in software testing to measure the percentage of code that is executed when running automated tests. By using `simplecov`, development teams can gain insights into how well their tests cover the codebase, identify areas that are not adequately tested, and improve the overall quality and reliability of their Ruby software.

Business priorities and goals for using `simplecov` include:
- Improving software quality: By identifying untested code, `simplecov` helps ensure that a larger portion of the codebase is exercised by tests, reducing the likelihood of bugs and defects in production.
- Reducing technical debt: Identifying and addressing gaps in test coverage can prevent the accumulation of technical debt related to untested or poorly tested code.
- Enhancing developer productivity: Code coverage metrics can guide developers in writing more effective tests and focusing their testing efforts on critical areas of the application.
- Supporting compliance and regulatory requirements: In some industries, code coverage metrics may be required for compliance or regulatory purposes to demonstrate software quality and testing rigor.

Most important business risks related to using `simplecov` include:
- Misinterpretation of coverage metrics: High code coverage does not guarantee the absence of bugs. It's possible to have high coverage with ineffective tests that do not adequately test the functionality or edge cases. Over-reliance on coverage metrics without considering the quality of tests can lead to a false sense of security.
- Performance overhead: Running code coverage analysis can introduce performance overhead during testing, potentially slowing down development cycles.
- Security vulnerabilities in `simplecov` itself: Like any software, `simplecov` could potentially have security vulnerabilities. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could impact the development process or the security of projects using `simplecov`.
- Incorrect coverage reporting: Bugs in `simplecov` could lead to inaccurate coverage reports, providing misleading information to developers and potentially undermining the benefits of using the tool.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the `simplecov` project and its usage are primarily focused on general software development best practices and the Ruby ecosystem.

Security controls:
- security control: Using publicly available GitHub repository for source code, allowing community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Relying on RubyGems.org for distribution of the gem, which provides some level of package integrity and versioning. (Implemented: RubyGems.org)
- security control: Utilizing standard Ruby testing frameworks (e.g., RSpec, Minitest) for testing `simplecov` itself. (Implemented: Test suite within the repository)
- security control: Following general secure coding practices in Ruby development. (Implemented: Implicit in development process)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by `simplecov`.
- accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities in `simplecov` code itself, requiring community vigilance and timely security updates.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the RubyGems.org platform.
- accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service if coverage analysis significantly slows down test suites in development or CI environments.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in `simplecov`'s dependencies.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the `simplecov` development pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in `simplecov`, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Consider code signing releases of the `simplecov` gem to enhance trust and integrity.

Security requirements for `simplecov` and projects using it:

Authentication:
- Not directly applicable to `simplecov` itself as it is a library.
- For projects using `simplecov`, standard authentication mechanisms for development environments and CI/CD pipelines should be in place.

Authorization:
- Not directly applicable to `simplecov` itself.
- Access control to development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and code repositories should be properly configured for projects using `simplecov`.

Input validation:
- `simplecov` takes configuration options as input. Input validation should be performed to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities due to malicious or malformed configurations. This includes validating file paths, regular expressions, and other configuration parameters.

Cryptography:
- Cryptography is not a core requirement for `simplecov`. However, if `simplecov` were to handle sensitive data (which is not the current case), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently collected or exposed by `simplecov`.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) for projects using `simplecov`. Ensuring the integrity and reliability of code coverage analysis as part of the testing process.
- Distribution of `simplecov` gem to the Ruby community, maintaining trust and preventing supply chain attacks.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- `simplecov` source code: Sensitivity: Medium. Confidentiality is less critical as it's open source, but integrity and availability are important to prevent malicious modifications.
- Coverage data generated by `simplecov`: Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Coverage data itself is generally not highly sensitive, but it can reveal information about the structure and logic of the codebase. In some cases, this might be considered sensitive.
- Build artifacts (gem files): Sensitivity: Medium. Integrity is critical to prevent distribution of compromised or malicious versions of `simplecov`.

- The development and distribution of `simplecov` follow standard open-source practices and rely on the security of platforms like GitHub and RubyGems.org.
- Code coverage data generated by `simplecov` is generally considered to be of low to medium sensitivity.
- The focus of security controls is on preventing supply chain attacks, ensuring code integrity, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in `simplecov` itself.
