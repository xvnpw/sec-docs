## Attack Tree Path: [[2.0] Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of SimpleCov](./attack_tree_paths/_2_0__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_simplecov.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how SimpleCov is set up and used within the application, specifically focusing on insecure configurations rather than library vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Misconfigurations are a common occurrence in web application deployments due to human error, rushed deployments, or lack of security awareness.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Information Disclosure primarily. While not direct code execution, leaked information can significantly aid further, more impactful attacks.
*   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting misconfigurations often requires minimal effort, relying on standard web reconnaissance techniques.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of web requests and common web paths is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Standard web traffic, might be missed without specific monitoring for coverage report access attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Exploit Insecure Report Storage or Access](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__exploit_insecure_report_storage_or_access.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities related to how coverage reports are stored and accessed, focusing on scenarios where access controls are insufficient or misconfigured.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might overlook the security implications of coverage reports, especially in internal or staging environments, leading to insecure storage or access configurations.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Information Disclosure. Access to reports reveals internal application details, code structure, and potentially uncovered code areas.
*   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting insecure storage often involves standard web requests or basic file system access if system access is gained through other means.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic web request skills or system access knowledge if file system permissions are targeted.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium - Depends on the specific misconfiguration. Publicly accessible web reports are easier to detect in logs, while file system permission issues might be harder to spot without specific monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1] Access Publicly Accessible Coverage Reports](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1__access_publicly_accessible_coverage_reports.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the scenario where coverage reports are unintentionally made accessible to the public via the web server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium -  Accidental public exposure can happen due to incorrect web server configuration, default settings, or developers forgetting to restrict access before deployment.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Information Disclosure. Publicly accessible reports are easily discoverable and provide immediate access to sensitive application information.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires only standard web browsing or automated tools to discover and access publicly available resources.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - No specialized skills are needed.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low -  Standard web traffic, might be missed unless specifically monitoring for access to known coverage report paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1.1] Discover Publicly Accessible Report Path](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1_1__discover_publicly_accessible_report_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Identifying the URL or file path where coverage reports are located when they are unintentionally exposed publicly.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common paths like `/coverage`, `/reports`, `/simplecov` are often tried by attackers. `robots.txt` or directory listing misconfigurations can also inadvertently reveal paths.
*   **Impact:** Low - Path discovery itself is a preliminary step, but confirms the potential for information disclosure.
*   **Effort:** Low - Simple tools like web browsers, `curl`, or directory brute-forcers can be used.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic web reconnaissance skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Standard web traffic, path discovery attempts might be mixed with normal browsing or automated scans.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1.2] Access and Analyze Coverage Reports](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1_2__access_and_analyze_coverage_reports.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once the report path is discovered, accessing the reports using standard web requests (e.g., HTTP GET) and then analyzing the content of the reports.
*   **Likelihood:** High - If the path is discovered to be publicly accessible, accessing the reports is usually straightforward.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Information Disclosure. Access to reports allows for detailed analysis of code structure, internal paths, and potentially uncovered code areas.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires a web browser or simple scripting to download and view the reports.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic web browsing and file handling skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Standard web traffic, accessing static files might not be flagged as suspicious unless specific monitoring is in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1.2.1] Extract Sensitive Information from Coverage Reports](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1_2_1__extract_sensitive_information_from_coverage_reports.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Analyzing the content of the accessed coverage reports to extract sensitive information that can be used for further attacks or understanding the application's internals.
*   **Likelihood:** High - If reports are accessible, extracting information is a logical next step and relatively easy.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Information Disclosure. Extracted information (internal paths, code structure, uncovered areas) significantly aids in reconnaissance and planning subsequent attacks.
*   **Effort:** Low - Manual review of reports or simple scripts to parse and extract specific data.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of code and file formats.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low - Analyzing the content of downloaded files is an off-system activity and not directly detectable by the application.
