# Threat Model Analysis for simplecov-ruby/simplecov

## Threat: [Threat 2: Supply Chain Vulnerability - Compromise of SimpleCov Gem](./threats/threat_2_supply_chain_vulnerability_-_compromise_of_simplecov_gem.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Vulnerability - Compromise of SimpleCov Gem
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `simplecov` gem itself, either by injecting malicious code into a release on RubyGems.org or by gaining control of a maintainer account. If successful, the attacker could distribute a compromised version of SimpleCov. When developers install or update to this compromised version, the malicious code is executed within their development environments. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive data like environment variables, source code, or even modify the application's code during the instrumentation process.
*   **Impact:** High. A compromised SimpleCov gem could have severe consequences, potentially leading to data breaches, code tampering, and the introduction of backdoors into applications. It could compromise the entire development pipeline and potentially production deployments if malicious code persists.
*   **Affected SimpleCov Component:** All components of the gem are potentially affected as malicious code could be injected anywhere within the gem's codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management and Security Scanning:** Use dependency management tools like Bundler with `bundle audit` to track gem dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities in SimpleCov and its dependencies.
    *   **Verify Gem Checksums:** When installing or updating SimpleCov, verify the gem's checksum against known good values to detect potential tampering during download or distribution.
    *   **Use Reputable Gem Sources:** Only install gems from trusted sources like RubyGems.org. Be wary of installing gems from unofficial or less reputable sources.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep SimpleCov and all other gem dependencies updated to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Consider Gem Pinning:** In sensitive environments, consider pinning specific versions of SimpleCov to control updates and ensure consistency. Thoroughly test updates in a non-production environment before deploying them.
    *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for Ruby and RubyGems to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities affecting SimpleCov or its dependencies.
