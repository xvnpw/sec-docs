## Attack Tree Path: [1. Access Coverage Reports [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__access_coverage_reports__high_risk_.md)

This is the primary high-risk path, focusing on gaining unauthorized access to the generated coverage reports.

*   **1. Unprotected Report Directory [HIGH RISK]**: The reports are stored in a directory accessible without proper authentication or authorization.

    *   **1a. Default Directory (e.g., 'coverage') [CRITICAL]**:
        *   **Description:** SimpleCov, by default, often stores reports in a directory named "coverage". If this directory is within the web root and lacks access controls, an attacker can directly access the reports by browsing to a predictable URL (e.g., `https://example.com/coverage`).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1b. Insufficient Auth/Access Control [CRITICAL]**:
        *   **Description:** Even if a non-default directory is used, it might have weak permissions or lack proper authentication mechanisms.  This allows unauthorized users to access the reports.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Coverage Data/Reports](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_coverage_datareports.md)

* **5. Alter Config [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Description:** This involves modifying SimpleCov's configuration, typically by gaining unauthorized access to configuration files or environment variables. The goal is to make SimpleCov more vulnerable.
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low
    * **Impact:** Very High
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        * **5a. Change output directory to web-accessible location [CRITICAL]:**
            * **Description:** The attacker modifies the SimpleCov configuration to store the coverage reports in a directory that is directly accessible via the web server (e.g., within the web root). This makes the reports publicly available.
            * **Likelihood:** Very Low
            * **Impact:** Very High
            * **Effort:** High
            * **Skill Level:** Advanced
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
