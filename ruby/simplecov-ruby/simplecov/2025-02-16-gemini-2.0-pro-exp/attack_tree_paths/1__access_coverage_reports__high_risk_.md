# Deep Analysis of SimpleCov Attack Tree Path: Access Coverage Reports

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path leading to unauthorized access of SimpleCov coverage reports. We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to prevent attackers from leveraging these weaknesses.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that sensitive code coverage data remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized parties.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

**1. Access Coverage Reports [HIGH RISK]**
   * **1. Unprotected Report Directory [HIGH RISK]**
      * **1a. Default Directory (e.g., 'coverage') [CRITICAL]**
      * **1b. Insufficient Auth/Access Control [CRITICAL]**

The scope includes:

*   **Technical Vulnerabilities:**  Analyzing the configuration and deployment aspects of SimpleCov that could lead to exposed reports.
*   **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describing how an attacker might discover and exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Providing specific, actionable recommendations to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Detection Methods:** Suggesting ways to identify if an attack has occurred or is in progress.

The scope *excludes* other potential attack vectors against the application itself, focusing solely on the security of the SimpleCov reports.  It also excludes vulnerabilities within SimpleCov's code itself, assuming the library is functioning as designed.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it with realistic attack scenarios.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will examine the technical details of how SimpleCov generates and stores reports, focusing on potential misconfigurations and weaknesses.
3.  **Exploitability Assessment:**  We will evaluate the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty of each vulnerability, as provided in the initial attack tree, and provide further justification.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, prioritizing those with the highest impact and lowest implementation effort.
5.  **Detection Strategy:** We will outline methods for detecting attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities, including log analysis and intrusion detection system (IDS) rules.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 1. Access Coverage Reports [HIGH RISK]

This is the overarching goal of the attacker: to gain access to the code coverage reports generated by SimpleCov.  These reports contain valuable information about the application's codebase, including:

*   **Code Structure:**  The reports reveal the organization of the code, including file names, class names, and method names.
*   **Untested Code:**  The reports highlight areas of the code that are not covered by tests.  This is particularly valuable to an attacker, as it indicates potential areas of weakness or vulnerabilities that have not been thoroughly vetted.
*   **Logic Flow:**  By analyzing the coverage data, an attacker can gain insights into the application's logic and identify potential attack vectors.

The confidentiality of this information is crucial.  Exposure can significantly aid an attacker in understanding the application's inner workings and crafting targeted attacks.

#### 1. Unprotected Report Directory [HIGH RISK]

This vulnerability stems from the reports being stored in a location that is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.  This is a common misconfiguration, especially in development or staging environments.

##### 1a. Default Directory (e.g., 'coverage') [CRITICAL]

*   **Description:** SimpleCov, by default, places generated HTML reports in a directory named `coverage` within the project's root directory. If this directory is inadvertently placed within the web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/`, `public_html/`, or a similar directory served by the web server), and directory listing is not explicitly disabled, an attacker can simply navigate to `https://example.com/coverage/` to access the reports.  This is a classic example of information disclosure due to misconfiguration.

*   **Likelihood: Medium**  While developers *should* be aware of this risk, it's common for this directory to be accidentally exposed, especially during development or in less mature deployment pipelines.  Automated deployments might inadvertently copy the `coverage` directory to the web root.

*   **Impact: High**  Exposure of the coverage reports provides the attacker with significant insights into the application's codebase, as described above. This can drastically reduce the effort required to find and exploit other vulnerabilities.

*   **Effort: Very Low**  The attacker simply needs to try a predictable URL.  No specialized tools or techniques are required.

*   **Skill Level: Novice**  This attack requires minimal technical skill.  Anyone with basic web browsing knowledge can attempt it.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium**  While web server logs will record access to the `coverage` directory, these requests might be indistinguishable from legitimate traffic if the application itself serves content from that directory (which it shouldn't).  Specific IDS rules or web application firewall (WAF) rules could be configured to detect and block access to this directory.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  An attacker, performing reconnaissance on the target application (`https://example.com`), attempts to access common directories associated with development tools.
    2.  The attacker tries `https://example.com/coverage/`.
    3.  If the directory is exposed, the attacker sees a directory listing or the SimpleCov HTML report index.
    4.  The attacker downloads the entire report set and analyzes it offline.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Store Reports in Web Root:** The most crucial mitigation is to *never* store the `coverage` directory (or any directory containing sensitive reports) within the web server's document root.  Configure SimpleCov to output reports to a directory outside the web root (e.g., `/var/reports/simplecov/`).
    *   **Configure Web Server to Deny Access:**  Even if the reports are accidentally placed in the web root, configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to explicitly deny access to the `coverage` directory.  This can be done using `.htaccess` files (Apache) or server configuration blocks (Nginx).  Example (Apache .htaccess):
        ```apache
        <Directory "/var/www/html/coverage">
            Require all denied
        </Directory>
        ```
        Example (Nginx):
        ```nginx
        location /coverage {
            deny all;
        }
        ```
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:** Ensure that directory listing is disabled on the web server.  This prevents attackers from seeing a list of files if they access a directory without an index file.  This is a general security best practice.
    *   **Automated Security Scans:**  Integrate automated security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect exposed directories and other misconfigurations.  Tools like OWASP ZAP, Nikto, and others can be used for this purpose.
    * **Review Deployment Scripts:** Carefully review deployment scripts and processes to ensure that the `coverage` directory is not inadvertently copied to the web root.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Web Server Logs:** Monitor web server access logs for requests to `/coverage/` (or the configured report directory).  Unexpected or frequent access from unknown IP addresses should be investigated.
    * **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Configure IDS rules to alert on or block access to the `/coverage/` directory.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to monitor the web root for unexpected files or directories.  The creation of a `coverage` directory within the web root should trigger an alert.

##### 1b. Insufficient Auth/Access Control [CRITICAL]

*   **Description:** Even if the reports are stored in a non-default directory, or behind some form of access control, the authentication or authorization mechanisms might be weak or misconfigured.  This could allow unauthorized users to bypass the intended security measures.  Examples include:
    *   **Weak Passwords:**  If basic authentication is used, weak or default passwords could be easily guessed or brute-forced.
    *   **Broken Authentication:**  Flaws in the authentication logic could allow attackers to bypass authentication entirely.
    *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  Incorrect file system permissions might allow any user on the system to read the report files, even if web-based authentication is in place.
    *   **Exposure via Shared Hosting:** In shared hosting environments, other users on the same server might be able to access the report files if permissions are not properly restricted.

*   **Likelihood: Low** This is less likely than the default directory exposure, as it requires a more specific misconfiguration or a flaw in the authentication mechanism. However, it's still a critical vulnerability if present.

*   **Impact: High**  The impact is the same as with the default directory exposure: the attacker gains access to sensitive code coverage information.

*   **Effort: Low**  The effort depends on the specific weakness.  Brute-forcing a weak password is low effort, while exploiting a broken authentication mechanism might require more effort.

*   **Skill Level: Intermediate**  The required skill level varies depending on the vulnerability.  Brute-forcing requires basic scripting skills, while exploiting a broken authentication mechanism might require more advanced web application security knowledge.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium**  Detecting this type of attack can be challenging, as it might resemble legitimate access attempts.  Failed login attempts in web server logs or authentication logs could indicate brute-force attacks.  More sophisticated attacks might require deeper analysis of application logs and behavior.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  An attacker discovers that the coverage reports are accessible at a non-standard URL (e.g., `https://example.com/reports/coverage/`).
    2.  The attacker encounters a basic authentication prompt.
    3.  The attacker attempts to guess common usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, admin/password, test/test).
    4.  If successful, the attacker gains access to the reports.
    5.  Alternatively, if there's a flaw in the authentication mechanism, the attacker might be able to bypass the authentication prompt entirely.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  If authentication is required to access the reports, use strong, unique passwords.  Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
    *   **Secure Authentication Mechanisms:**  Use well-vetted and secure authentication libraries and frameworks.  Avoid implementing custom authentication logic, as this is prone to errors.
    *   **Proper File Permissions:**  Ensure that the report files and directories have the correct file system permissions.  Only the user account that needs to access the reports (e.g., the web server user) should have read access.  Other users on the system should not have access. Use `chmod` and `chown` to set appropriate permissions.
        *   Example: `chmod 600 /var/reports/simplecov/*` (only the owner can read and write)
        *   Example: `chown www-data:www-data /var/reports/simplecov/` (set owner and group to the web server user)
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege.  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * **Isolate in Dedicated Environment:** If possible, host sensitive reports on a separate, dedicated server or virtual machine with restricted access.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Authentication Logs:** Monitor authentication logs for failed login attempts, unusual login patterns, or successful logins from unexpected IP addresses.
    * **Web Server Logs:** Monitor web server logs for access to the report directory, paying attention to the HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).
    * **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Configure IDS rules to detect brute-force attacks and other suspicious activity related to authentication.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor the report directory for unauthorized access or modification.
