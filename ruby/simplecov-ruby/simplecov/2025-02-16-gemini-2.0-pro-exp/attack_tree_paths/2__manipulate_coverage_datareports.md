## Deep Analysis of SimpleCov Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Coverage Data/Reports -> Alter Config -> Change Output Directory

### 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the attack path: **Manipulate Coverage Data/Reports -> Alter Config -> Change output directory to web-accessible location**.  We will dissect the technical details, potential attack vectors, mitigation strategies, and detection methods related to this specific vulnerability within the context of a Ruby application using the SimpleCov library.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent this attack.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where an attacker successfully alters the SimpleCov configuration to change the output directory of coverage reports to a publicly accessible location.  We will consider:

*   **Target Application:**  A Ruby application utilizing SimpleCov for code coverage analysis.  We assume the application is deployed in a production environment.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  An external attacker with advanced technical skills and potentially prior knowledge of the target system's configuration.  We assume the attacker has *not* already gained root access to the server.
*   **SimpleCov Configuration:**  We will examine how SimpleCov's configuration is managed (e.g., `.simplecov` file, environment variables) and how an attacker might exploit these mechanisms.
*   **Web Server Configuration:** We will consider how the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Puma, Passenger) is configured and how this configuration interacts with the attacker's actions.
*   **Exclusion:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors against SimpleCov, such as manipulating the coverage data itself or exploiting vulnerabilities within the SimpleCov library's code.  It also does not cover general server hardening practices unrelated to SimpleCov.

### 3. Methodology

This analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Technical Background:**  Provide a brief overview of how SimpleCov configuration works, focusing on output directory settings.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Detail the specific steps an attacker might take to achieve the objective, including potential vulnerabilities and exploits.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage resulting from successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose concrete, actionable steps to prevent the attack, including configuration changes, code modifications, and security best practices.
5.  **Detection Methods:**  Describe how to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability, including log analysis, intrusion detection system (IDS) rules, and security monitoring.
6.  **Recommendations:** Summarize the key findings and provide prioritized recommendations for the development team.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Technical Background

SimpleCov's output directory is typically configured in one of two ways:

*   **`.simplecov` file:**  A configuration file, usually located at the root of the project, can contain a `SimpleCov.coverage_dir` setting.  For example:

    ```ruby
    # .simplecov
    SimpleCov.coverage_dir 'coverage' # Default location
    ```

*   **Environment Variable:** The `COVERAGE_DIR` environment variable can override the `.simplecov` setting.  This is often used in CI/CD pipelines.  For example:

    ```bash
    export COVERAGE_DIR=/path/to/coverage
    ```

SimpleCov, by default, places the coverage reports in a `coverage` directory relative to the project root.  This directory is *not* intended to be web-accessible.

#### 4.2 Attack Vector Analysis

An attacker could change the output directory to a web-accessible location through several potential attack vectors:

1.  **Configuration File Modification:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the attacker gains write access to the `.simplecov` file (e.g., through a file inclusion vulnerability, a compromised developer account, or a misconfigured version control system), they can directly modify the `SimpleCov.coverage_dir` setting.
    *   **Exploit:** The attacker changes the setting to a directory within the web root, such as `/var/www/html/my_app/public/coverage_reports`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        # .simplecov (modified by attacker)
        SimpleCov.coverage_dir 'public/coverage_reports'
        ```

2.  **Environment Variable Manipulation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** If the attacker can modify environment variables accessible to the application process (e.g., through a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, a compromised CI/CD pipeline, or a misconfigured server), they can set the `COVERAGE_DIR` variable.
    *   **Exploit:** The attacker sets `COVERAGE_DIR` to a web-accessible path.
    *   **Example:**
        ```bash
        # Attacker sets this via a compromised CI/CD pipeline or SSRF
        export COVERAGE_DIR=/var/www/html/my_app/public/coverage_reports
        ```

3.  **Exploiting Server Misconfigurations:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  A misconfigured web server might inadvertently expose the default `coverage` directory.  For example, an overly permissive `Alias` or `Directory` directive in Apache could make the directory accessible.
    *   **Exploit:** While this doesn't involve *changing* the SimpleCov configuration, it achieves the same result.  The attacker doesn't need to modify any files; they simply exploit the existing misconfiguration.

4. **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack:**
    * **Vulnerability:** While less direct, an attacker could publish a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency, and this malicious package could modify the SimpleCov configuration during installation or runtime.
    * **Exploit:** The malicious package includes a post-install script that modifies the `.simplecov` file or sets the `COVERAGE_DIR` environment variable.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of this attack is **Very High** because:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Coverage reports can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal structure, including:
    *   **Source Code Snippets:**  SimpleCov reports often include snippets of the source code, highlighting covered and uncovered lines.  This can expose proprietary algorithms, business logic, and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **File Paths:**  The reports reveal the directory structure and file names of the application, aiding attackers in further reconnaissance.
    *   **Test Data:**  If tests use sensitive data (which is a bad practice but sometimes happens), this data might be indirectly exposed through the coverage reports.
*   **Facilitates Further Attacks:**  The exposed information can be used to craft more targeted attacks against the application.  For example, an attacker could identify untested code paths and focus their efforts on exploiting vulnerabilities in those areas.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Publicly exposing source code and internal application details can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the nature of the application and the data it handles, exposing coverage reports could violate data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

Multiple layers of defense are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability:

1.  **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **File Permissions:**  Ensure that the `.simplecov` file has restrictive permissions (e.g., `600` or `640`) and is owned by a user with minimal privileges.  Prevent write access to this file from the web server user.
    *   **Version Control:**  Store the `.simplecov` file in a secure version control system (e.g., Git) and implement strict access controls and code review processes.
    *   **Environment Variable Security:**  Avoid storing sensitive configuration values directly in environment variables that are broadly accessible.  Use a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment-specific configuration files with restricted access) to manage environment variables.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**  Secure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modification of environment variables or build scripts.  Implement strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.

2.  **Web Server Hardening:**
    *   **Restrict Access:**  Configure the web server to explicitly deny access to the default `coverage` directory and any other directories that should not be publicly accessible.  Use `Deny from all` directives in Apache or equivalent configurations in other web servers.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the web server process with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running it as root.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the web server configuration to identify and remediate misconfigurations.

3.  **Code Review and Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Code Review:**  Include SimpleCov configuration review as part of the code review process.  Ensure that the output directory is not set to a web-accessible location.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Tests:**  Do not use real, sensitive data in tests.  Use mock data or anonymized data instead.

4.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `gemnasium` to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Package Verification:** Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures.
    *   **Private Package Repositories:** Consider using a private package repository to control the dependencies used in the project and reduce the risk of dependency confusion attacks.

5. **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):**
    * Ensure that the application process itself runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  If the application doesn't need to write to the SimpleCov output directory after initialization, consider making that directory read-only for the application user.

#### 4.5 Detection Methods

Detecting this attack requires a combination of techniques:

1.  **Log Analysis:**
    *   **Web Server Logs:** Monitor web server access logs for requests to the `coverage` directory or any other unusual directories containing HTML files.  Look for unexpected IP addresses or user agents accessing these resources.
    *   **Application Logs:**  If SimpleCov logs any configuration changes (which it may not by default), monitor these logs for modifications to the `coverage_dir` setting.

2.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Rules:**
    *   Create IDS rules to detect attempts to access the `coverage` directory or any directory containing SimpleCov reports.  These rules can trigger alerts based on URL patterns or HTTP response codes.

3.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   Use a FIM tool (e.g., OSSEC, Tripwire, Samhain) to monitor the `.simplecov` file for unauthorized modifications.  The FIM tool should alert on any changes to the file's contents or permissions.

4.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   Aggregate logs from various sources (web server, application, IDS, FIM) into a SIEM system.  Create correlation rules to detect suspicious patterns of activity, such as a file modification followed by web access to the modified file's output.

5.  **Regular Security Scans:**
    *   Perform regular vulnerability scans of the web application and server infrastructure.  These scans can identify misconfigurations and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to the SimpleCov configuration.

6. **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**
    *  A RASP solution could potentially detect and block attempts to modify the SimpleCov configuration at runtime, even if the attacker has gained some level of access to the system.

#### 4.6 Recommendations

The following recommendations are prioritized based on their impact and ease of implementation:

1.  **High Priority:**
    *   **Immediately review and secure the `.simplecov` file permissions.** Ensure it is not writable by the web server user.
    *   **Configure the web server to explicitly deny access to the default `coverage` directory.**
    *   **Implement a secure secrets management solution for environment variables.**
    *   **Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.**

2.  **Medium Priority:**
    *   **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) for the `.simplecov` file.**
    *   **Set up log analysis and alerting for suspicious web server access patterns.**
    *   **Conduct a thorough security audit of the web server and application configuration.**

3.  **Low Priority:**
    *   **Consider implementing a RASP solution.**
    *   **Explore using a private package repository.**

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and protect sensitive information exposed by SimpleCov coverage reports. The key is a layered defense approach, combining secure configuration, web server hardening, secure coding practices, and robust monitoring.
