# Threat Model Analysis for simplecov-ruby/simplecov

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Modification](./threats/malicious_configuration_modification.md)

### Threat: Malicious Configuration Modification

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the project's repository or development environment and modifies the `.simplecov` configuration file. This could involve disabling coverage, excluding specific files or directories from analysis (potentially hiding malicious code). In a more critical scenario, if vulnerabilities exist in SimpleCov's configuration loading mechanism, an attacker might attempt to leverage this to execute arbitrary code within the testing environment.
    - **How:** This could be achieved through compromised developer credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in development infrastructure, or insider threats.
- **Impact:**
    - **Impact:**  Inaccurate or incomplete code coverage reports, leading to a false sense of security and potentially masking vulnerabilities. If critical files are excluded, vulnerabilities within those files might go undetected. In the critical scenario involving configuration loading vulnerabilities, it could lead to arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, potentially compromising the development system.
- **Affected Component:**
    - **Component:** SimpleCov's configuration loading mechanism, specifically the code responsible for parsing and applying the settings from the `.simplecov` file.
- **Risk Severity:** High (escalates to Critical if arbitrary code execution is possible)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure access to the project repository and development environments using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Implement code review processes for all changes, including modifications to the `.simplecov` file.
    - Consider storing the `.simplecov` file in a more protected location or using environment variables for sensitive configuration if feasible within the project structure.
    - Regularly audit the `.simplecov` file for unexpected or unauthorized changes.
    - Implement file integrity monitoring for the `.simplecov` file.
    - **For preventing arbitrary code execution:** Ensure SimpleCov's configuration loading logic is robust and avoids using unsafe methods like `eval` directly on configuration values.

## Threat: [Malicious Output Report Injection](./threats/malicious_output_report_injection.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious Output Report Injection
    - **Description:**
        - **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates data that SimpleCov uses to generate its HTML reports, injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into elements that appear in the report (e.g., test descriptions, file paths). This exploits a lack of proper output sanitization within SimpleCov's report generation.
        - **How:** This could happen if an attacker can influence the test execution environment or the data provided to the testing framework. The vulnerability lies in SimpleCov's failure to sanitize this input before embedding it in the HTML report.
    - **Impact:**
        - **Impact:** If the generated HTML reports are hosted on a web server and viewed by other users, the injected malicious code could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions in the context of the victim's browser. This is a high severity issue as it directly stems from SimpleCov's output generation.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - **Component:** SimpleCov's HTML report generation module, specifically the parts responsible for rendering data into HTML without proper sanitization.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Crucially:** Ensure SimpleCov uses proper output encoding and sanitization techniques when generating HTML reports to prevent the execution of injected scripts. This is a responsibility of the SimpleCov developers.
        - If hosting the reports, implement standard web security practices such as Content Security Policy (CSP) as an additional layer of defense.
        - Be cautious about viewing SimpleCov reports from untrusted or potentially compromised sources.
