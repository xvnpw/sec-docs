## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Coverage Data leading to Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_coverage_data_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Gain Access to Coverage Data Files [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the initial critical step in this attack path.
    * **Exploit Insecure Storage Location [HIGH RISK - L:M, I:H, E:L, S:B]:**
        * Attack Vector: The attacker identifies that SimpleCov's coverage data files (typically within a `.coverage` directory) are stored in a publicly accessible location, such as within the web application's document root or a shared directory with weak permissions.
        * Consequence: This allows the attacker to directly read and potentially modify the coverage data files.
    * **Exploit Insufficient File Permissions [HIGH RISK - L:M, I:H, E:M, S:I]:**
        * Attack Vector:  Even if the storage location isn't public, the attacker discovers that the file permissions on the coverage data files or the directory are too permissive. This could be due to misconfiguration or inadequate deployment practices.
        * Consequence: An attacker who has gained some level of access to the server (through other means or vulnerabilities) can read and modify these files.

* **Inject Malicious Code into Coverage Data [CRITICAL NODE - L:L, I:C, E:H, S:A]:**
    * Attack Vector: Having gained access to the coverage data files, the attacker crafts malicious content within these files. This requires understanding the format of SimpleCov's data files.
    * Consequence: If the application processes this coverage data in an unsafe manner (e.g., by directly interpreting file paths or content within the coverage data), the injected malicious code could be executed by the application, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is heavily dependent on the application's specific implementation and how it interacts with SimpleCov's output beyond basic report generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Report Generation for XSS/RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_report_generation_for_xssrce.md)

**Inject Malicious Content into Reports [CRITICAL NODE]:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities within the report generation process.
    * **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Filenames/Paths [HIGH RISK - L:M, I:M, E:L, S:B-I]:**
        * Attack Vector: SimpleCov uses filenames and paths from the tested code in its reports. The attacker crafts filenames containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
        * Consequence: When the report is generated and viewed in a web browser, the unsanitized malicious code is included in the HTML output and executed by the browser. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface the application interface.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Report Template Engine [HIGH RISK - L:L, I:H, E:H, S:A]:**
        * Attack Vector: SimpleCov utilizes a templating engine (likely ERB in Ruby) to generate its reports. The attacker identifies and exploits a known security vulnerability within the specific version of the templating engine used by SimpleCov.
        * Consequence: By manipulating the input or context provided to the templating engine during report generation, the attacker can inject arbitrary code that is executed on the server during the report generation process, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
