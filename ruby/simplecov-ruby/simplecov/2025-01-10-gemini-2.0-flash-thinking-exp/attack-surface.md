# Attack Surface Analysis for simplecov-ruby/simplecov

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Code Coverage Reports](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_code_coverage_reports.md)

* **Description:** SimpleCov generates HTML reports detailing code coverage, which can reveal sensitive information about the application's structure and untested areas.
    * **How SimpleCov Contributes:** SimpleCov's primary function is to create these reports and store them in the file system, often within the application's directory structure. If not properly secured, these reports can become accessible.
    * **Example:**  A developer accidentally deploys the entire application directory, including the `coverage/` folder, to a public-facing web server. An attacker can then browse to `https://example.com/coverage/index.html` and view the coverage report.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Information Disclosure:** Attackers gain insights into untested code paths, potential vulnerabilities, and the overall structure of the application.
        * **Reverse Engineering:**  Understanding the code coverage can aid in reverse engineering efforts.
        * **Identification of Weaknesses:**  Highlighting areas with low coverage can pinpoint potential targets for exploitation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Deployment Practices:** Ensure the `coverage/` directory and its contents are explicitly excluded from deployment packages and configurations for production environments.
        * **`.gitignore` Configuration:** Add the `coverage/` directory to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental committing of coverage reports to version control.
        * **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls on the server where the application is deployed, preventing unauthorized access to the file system.
        * **Report Storage Location:**  Store coverage reports in a location outside the web server's document root or behind authentication if they need to be accessible for internal review.
