## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise Application by Exploiting SimpleCov Weaknesses

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt the application's functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the SimpleCov library.

    * AND - Exploit SimpleCov Functionality
        * OR - Manipulate Coverage Data [HIGH RISK PATH]

                        * Inject malicious content into reports (e.g., XSS in HTML reports) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Indirect via Configuration Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]

                    * Change output path to overwrite sensitive files [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * OR - Exploit Report Generation Process
            * Code Injection via Report Templates (if applicable) [HIGH RISK PATH]

        * OR - Exploit Dependencies of SimpleCov [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Identify Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]
                * Exploit the vulnerability in the dependency [HIGH RISK PATH]
                    * Achieve application compromise through the dependency [CRITICAL NODE]

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via SimpleCov:**
    * This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate successful exploitation of SimpleCov vulnerabilities.

* **Direct File Access:**
    * This node represents the point where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the directory where SimpleCov stores its coverage data. This access is a prerequisite for further malicious actions like modifying the data.

* **Modify coverage data files:**
    * At this node, the attacker has successfully accessed the coverage data files and can now manipulate their content. This manipulation can lead to injecting malicious scripts or corrupting the data.

* **Modify SimpleCov Configuration:**
    * This critical node signifies the attacker's ability to alter the SimpleCov configuration. This control allows them to redirect output, potentially overwriting sensitive files, or disable any safeguards.

* **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) during report generation:**
    * This node represents a highly critical outcome where the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server during the report generation process. This typically stems from vulnerabilities in report templating engines.

* **Identify Vulnerable Dependencies:**
    * This node highlights the critical step where an attacker successfully identifies that SimpleCov relies on a vulnerable version of another library. This knowledge is the key to exploiting those vulnerabilities.

* **Achieve application compromise through the dependency:**
    * This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability in a SimpleCov dependency, leading to the compromise of the main application.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Manipulate Coverage Data -> Inject malicious content into reports (e.g., XSS in HTML reports):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the SimpleCov output directory has insecure permissions, an attacker can access and modify the coverage data files. By injecting malicious scripts into the data, which is then used to generate HTML reports, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of developers viewing these reports. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or further attacks on the development environment.

* **Manipulate Coverage Data -> Modify SimpleCov Configuration -> Change output path to overwrite sensitive files:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  If the SimpleCov configuration file is accessible and modifiable, an attacker can change the output path setting. By setting the output path to a location where sensitive application files reside, the attacker can overwrite these files when SimpleCov generates its reports. This can lead to denial of service, application malfunction, or even the introduction of malicious code.

* **Code Injection via Report Templates (if applicable) -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) during report generation:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If SimpleCov uses a templating engine to generate reports and the data used to populate these templates is influenced by attacker-controlled input (potentially through manipulated coverage data), it might be possible to inject malicious code into the template. When the report is generated, the templating engine executes this injected code on the server, leading to Remote Code Execution.

* **Exploit Dependencies of SimpleCov -> Identify Vulnerable Dependencies -> Exploit the vulnerability in the dependency -> Achieve application compromise through the dependency:**
    * **Attack Vector:** SimpleCov relies on other Ruby gems (libraries). If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This often involves identifying the vulnerable dependency, finding an existing exploit, and leveraging it to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within the application's context.
