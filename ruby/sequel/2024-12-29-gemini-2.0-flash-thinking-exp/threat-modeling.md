Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the Sequel library:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via String Interpolation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating user-provided input that is directly embedded into SQL queries using Sequel's string interpolation features. For example, if the code uses `db["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{params[:username]}'"].all`, an attacker could provide a `params[:username]` value like `' OR '1'='1'` to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data. This vulnerability stems directly from how Sequel allows raw SQL construction.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers could potentially gain full control of the database server in severe cases.
    *   **Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Database` methods that execute raw SQL queries or use string interpolation for query construction (e.g., `[]`, `fetch`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries (placeholders):** Utilize Sequel's placeholder syntax (e.g., `db["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", params[:username]].all`) or prepared statements.
        *   **Avoid string interpolation for user input:** Never directly embed user-provided data into SQL strings when using Sequel's query building features.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Unsafe `where` Clause Arguments
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through certain forms of the `where` clause if user input is not properly handled within Sequel's Dataset API. For instance, using a raw string directly in `dataset.where("username = '#{params[:username]}'")` is vulnerable due to Sequel's interpretation of this input.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to string interpolation, this can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Dataset` methods, specifically the `where` method when used with raw string arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use hash conditions in `where`:** Prefer using hash-based conditions (e.g., `dataset.where(username: params[:username])`). Sequel handles escaping correctly in this case.
        *   **Use array conditions with placeholders:** Utilize array-based conditions with placeholders (e.g., `dataset.where("username = ?", params[:username])`).
        *   **Use `Sequel.lit` with extreme caution:** If using `Sequel.lit` for raw SQL fragments, ensure thorough sanitization and validation of any user-provided data before embedding it. Understand the implications of using raw SQL within Sequel.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Models
    *   **Description:** An attacker could modify unintended model attributes by providing extra parameters during record creation or updates if Sequel's model layer mass assignment features are not properly configured. For example, if a user model has an `is_admin` attribute, an attacker might try to set it to `true` by including `is_admin=true` in the request parameters, exploiting Sequel's default behavior of allowing mass assignment.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other unintended changes to application state.
    *   **Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Model` methods like `create`, `update`, `set`, and `set_fields`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use `set_allowed_columns`:** Define explicitly which attributes are allowed to be set during mass assignment in your Sequel model definitions.
        *   **Use `set_restricted_columns`:** Define explicitly which attributes are *not* allowed to be set during mass assignment in your Sequel model definitions.
        *   **Whitelist attributes in controllers:** Filter parameters in your controllers to only allow specific attributes to be passed to Sequel model creation or update methods, providing an additional layer of defense.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Database Connection String Handling
    *   **Description:**  While not a vulnerability *within* Sequel's code, the way developers configure Sequel's database connection can introduce high risks. Storing database credentials directly in code or easily accessible configuration files (without proper encryption or secure storage) makes the application vulnerable if compromised. Sequel relies on the provided connection string.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers gaining access to database credentials used by Sequel can directly access and manipulate the database, bypassing application security measures enforced by Sequel at a higher level.
    *   **Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Database.connect` and related methods for establishing database connections, specifically the handling of the connection string.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use environment variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables that are not directly part of the codebase and are managed by the operating system or container environment.
        *   **Utilize secure secrets management systems:** Employ dedicated tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar services to manage and access database credentials securely, and configure Sequel to retrieve credentials from these sources.
        *   **Encrypt configuration files:** If storing credentials in configuration files used by Sequel, ensure they are properly encrypted.
