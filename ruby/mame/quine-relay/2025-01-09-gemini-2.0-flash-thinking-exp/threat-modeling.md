# Threat Model Analysis for mame/quine-relay

## Threat: [Code Injection through Malicious Relay Stage](./threats/code_injection_through_malicious_relay_stage.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or modifies a stage within the quine-relay sequence to contain malicious code. When this stage is executed by the corresponding interpreter, the attacker's code runs on the server. This directly leverages the code execution nature of the `quine-relay`.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, installation of malware, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Relay Stage (the content of the code for a specific stage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store relay stages in read-only locations or with strict access controls.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for relay stages before execution.
*   If relay stages are dynamically generated or fetched, strictly validate the source and content.
*   Run relay execution within a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.

## Threat: [Exploiting Interpreter/Compiler Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_interpretercompiler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a relay stage that exploits a known vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, remote code execution) in the specific interpreter or compiler used to execute that stage. This is a direct consequence of `quine-relay`'s reliance on multiple interpreters.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potential privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Interpreter/Compiler (the program executing a specific relay stage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep all interpreters and compilers used by the relay up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the relay stages to identify potential vulnerabilities before execution.
*   Run relay execution within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of exploits.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Relay Stage](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_relay_stage.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects a relay stage that is designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) when executed by its interpreter. This directly exploits the execution of code within the `quine-relay` framework.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime, performance degradation for other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** Relay Stage (the code causing excessive resource consumption).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage, disk I/O) for the execution of each relay stage.
*   Monitor resource usage during relay execution and implement timeouts.
*   Sanitize or validate any input that influences the relay's execution path or the content of stages.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Relay Stages](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_relay_stages.md)

**Description:** If the relay stages are sourced from an external repository or are modifiable by unauthorized parties, an attacker could compromise the source and inject malicious code into a seemingly legitimate stage. The application, by using `quine-relay`, would then execute this malicious code.

**Impact:** Code injection, full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Relay Stage Source (where the relay stage code is stored or retrieved from).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Source relay stages from trusted and verified sources.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for relay stages upon retrieval.
*   Regularly audit the sources of relay stages for potential compromises.
