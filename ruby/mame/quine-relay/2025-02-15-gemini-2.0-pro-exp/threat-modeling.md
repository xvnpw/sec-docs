# Threat Model Analysis for mame/quine-relay

## Threat: [Chain Modification (Injection)](./threats/chain_modification__injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the process of generating or storing the next program in the quine-relay sequence. They replace a legitimate program with a malicious one, or insert a new malicious program into the chain.  This leverages the *core functionality* of the quine-relay – the generation and execution of the next program in the sequence. The attacker exploits the handoff between stages.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the quine-relay application. The attacker can potentially steal data, modify system behavior, launch further attacks, or cause a denial of service. The integrity of the quine-relay is completely compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** The program storage mechanism (file system, database, network transit – *if used by the quine-relay for program transfer*), and the program loading/execution function (e.g., `exec()`, `eval()`, or language-specific equivalents) *as used within the quine-relay's program transition logic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cryptographic Hashing:** Before executing *any* program in the chain, calculate its cryptographic hash (SHA-256 or stronger) and compare it to a pre-calculated, securely stored "known good" hash. Reject execution if the hashes don't match. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Secure Storage (if applicable):** If the quine-relay design *itself* uses file system or database storage for intermediate programs, use strong access controls.
        *   **Secure Transmission (if applicable):** If the quine-relay design *itself* transmits programs over a network, use TLS/SSL with strong ciphers and certificate validation.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** Even if there's no direct user input, validate any data *used internally by the quine-relay* to construct the next program in the chain.

## Threat: [Core Logic Tampering](./threats/core_logic_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the code of the `quine-relay` itself (not a program *within* the chain, but the code that *generates* the chain). This involves altering the logic that determines how the next program is created, potentially introducing subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors *into the generation process*. This is a direct attack on the quine-relay's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can subtly alter the behavior of the entire quine-relay, potentially leading to future code execution vulnerabilities, information disclosure, or denial of service. The attacker gains control over the *evolution* of the chain, making future attacks easier.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core `quine-relay` code, specifically the functions responsible for generating the next program in the sequence. This is language-agnostic, affecting the overall logic of program generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Reviews:** Rigorous code reviews of the `quine-relay` implementation, with a *specific focus* on the code generation logic and any potential for injection or manipulation.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code generation process, particularly those related to code injection or unsafe string handling.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deploy the `quine-relay` in an immutable environment (e.g., a container) to prevent modification after deployment. This makes it harder to tamper with the core logic.
        *   **Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor the integrity of the `quine-relay` code itself (e.g., using file integrity monitoring tools or checksums) to detect unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) *via Quine Amplification*](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__via_quine_amplification.md)

*   **Description:**  While resource exhaustion is a general threat, the *quine-relay* introduces a specific amplification risk.  A malicious program within the chain could be designed to consume resources, and *because it generates the next program*, it can ensure that the next program *also* consumes resources, creating a cascading or exponential resource exhaustion attack.  This is distinct from a simple DoS; it's a DoS *amplified by the quine mechanism*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service. The `quine-relay` application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate use. The cascading nature can make recovery more difficult.
    *   **Affected Component:** The execution environment of each program in the chain, *but the vulnerability is triggered and amplified by the quine-relay's program generation logic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits on *each* program's execution. This is crucial, and the limits must be low enough to prevent cascading effects.
        *   **Timeouts:** Impose strict timeouts on the execution of each program. Terminate any program that exceeds the timeout.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Use a sandboxing solution that provides *robust* resource control capabilities, specifically designed to prevent runaway processes.
        * **Generation Logic Review:** Specifically review the quine generation logic to ensure it cannot be abused to create an exponentially resource-consuming chain. This might involve limiting the "complexity" or "size" of generated programs.
