# Attack Surface Analysis for mame/quine-relay

## Attack Surface: [1. Code Injection via Generation Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__code_injection_via_generation_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into the program generation sequence of the quine-relay.
*   **How Quine-Relay Contributes:** This is the *defining* attack vector of `quine-relay`.  The entire purpose of the project is to generate code, making it inherently vulnerable to injection if *any* part of the generation process is influenced by external input.
*   **Example:** If a user-supplied string is used as part of the initial seed program, an attacker could inject a string like `"; system("rm -rf /"); //` to execute arbitrary commands.  Even seemingly harmless input could be crafted to alter the generated code in unexpected ways.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the quine-relay.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate External Influence:** The *only* truly effective mitigation is to have a completely static, pre-defined quine-relay sequence with *absolutely no* external input influencing the generation.  This is the most important recommendation.
    *   **Strict Input Validation (If Necessary):** If external input *must* be used (strongly discouraged), implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization. This is a *defense-in-depth* measure, not a primary solution.  Use whitelisting, length limits, and context-specific validation.
    *   **Input Encoding:** Encode any user input before incorporating it, using appropriate encoding for the target language.  This is also a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the quine-relay process with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft input or manipulate the execution environment to cause one or more of the generated programs to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service.
*   **How Quine-Relay Contributes:** `Quine-relay`'s sequential execution of multiple programs, potentially in different languages, creates a direct pathway for resource exhaustion attacks.  The attacker doesn't need full code execution; they just need to trigger resource-intensive behavior in *one* of the generated programs.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects code that creates an infinite loop or allocates a large amount of memory within one of the generated programs.  A program that repeatedly forks (if process creation isn't limited) is another example.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict resource limits on the execution of *each* program in the chain. This is *essential*.  Include CPU time limits, memory limits, process limits, and file size limits.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts to terminate programs that run for too long.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Execute each program in an isolated environment (e.g., a container) to prevent it from affecting the host system or other processes.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage and terminate programs that exceed predefined thresholds.

## Attack Surface: [3. Interpreter/Compiler Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/3__interpretercompiler_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the language interpreters or compilers used by the quine-relay to gain control of the system.
*   **How Quine-Relay Contributes:** Because `quine-relay` executes code in multiple programming languages, it directly exposes the system to vulnerabilities in *any* of those languages' interpreters or compilers.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a program in the chain that exploits a known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of a Ruby interpreter.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the interpreter/compiler process, leading to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Interpreters/Compilers Updated:** This is *absolutely critical*. Ensure all language interpreters and compilers are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Use Minimal Set of Languages:** Reduce the number of different programming languages used in the relay to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the execution of each program in a separate sandbox or container.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. System Call Abuse](./attack_surfaces/4__system_call_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Generated code attempts to execute unauthorized or dangerous system calls.
*   **How Quine-Relay Contributes:** The generated code, if compromised via injection, could contain arbitrary system calls. The quine-relay's nature of generating and executing code makes this a direct risk.
*   **Example:** A compromised program in the relay attempts to execute `execve` to run a malicious binary, or `unlink` to delete critical system files.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data loss, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode):** Use seccomp or a similar system call filtering mechanism to restrict the system calls that can be made by the generated code. Create a whitelist of allowed system calls.
    *   **AppArmor/SELinux:** Use mandatory access control systems like AppArmor or SELinux.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Containerization provides a layer of isolation.
