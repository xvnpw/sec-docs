# Attack Tree Analysis for mame/quine-relay

Objective: Compromise application utilizing the `quine-relay` project by exploiting its inherent weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   AND: Inject Malicious Code Directly **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   OR: Craft Payload for Final Interpreter **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            *   Example: Inject shell commands in the final language (e.g., `system("malicious_command")` in PHP if PHP is the last stage).
            *   Example: Inject code to read sensitive files (e.g., `open('/etc/passwd', 'r').read()` in Python).
    *   AND: Exploit Language-Specific Vulnerabilities in Relay Stages **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   OR: Command Injection in Intermediate Stage **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            *   Example: Inject code in an early stage that, when processed by a later stage, executes shell commands.
*   OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Interpreters/Libraries **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   AND: Target Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Language Interpreters **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   OR: Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) in the versions of Python, Ruby, etc., used in the relay.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the application's entry point to inject malicious code that is processed by the `quine-relay`. This path is high-risk because it's a direct and often easily accessible point of interaction with the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code Directly](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_directly.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts input that, when it reaches the final interpreter in the relay, executes arbitrary code. This is a critical node because it directly achieves the attacker's goal of gaining control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Craft Payload for Final Interpreter](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_craft_payload_for_final_interpreter.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This involves creating the specific malicious code tailored to the final interpreter's language and capabilities. This is critical because it's the step where the attacker weaponizes their input to achieve a malicious outcome, such as executing system commands or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Language-Specific Vulnerabilities in Relay Stages](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_language-specific_vulnerabilities_in_relay_stages.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities specific to the programming languages used in the intermediate stages of the `quine-relay`. This path is high-risk because it introduces multiple potential points of failure and can be harder to detect due to the multi-stage nature of the attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Command Injection in Intermediate Stage](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_command_injection_in_intermediate_stage.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker injects code into an earlier stage of the relay that, when processed by a subsequent stage, results in the execution of arbitrary system commands. This is critical because it allows the attacker to gain control of the server even if the final stage is well-protected.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Interpreters/Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_interpreterslibraries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security flaws in the specific versions of the programming language interpreters (like Python, Ruby, etc.) or their associated libraries used by the `quine-relay`. This path is high-risk because it bypasses the application's code and directly exploits weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Target Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Language Interpreters](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_target_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_language_interpreters.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This involves identifying and exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the interpreters used by the `quine-relay`. This is critical because successful exploitation can grant the attacker immediate and significant control over the server, potentially without even needing to interact with the `quine-relay` logic directly.
