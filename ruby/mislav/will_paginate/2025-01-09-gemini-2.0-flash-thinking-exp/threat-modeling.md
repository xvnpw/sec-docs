# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/will_paginate

## Threat: [Unvalidated Page Parameter Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unvalidated_page_parameter_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large integer values for the `page` parameter. `will_paginate` attempts to calculate the offset based on this large value, potentially leading to the application querying a huge number of records from the database (even if they don't exist). This consumes significant server resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing the server or affecting other users.
*   **Affected Component:** `will_paginate`'s parameter parsing and offset calculation logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on the `page` parameter within the application before it reaches `will_paginate`. Ensure it's a positive integer within a reasonable range.
    *   Consider setting a maximum allowed page number based on the total number of items and items per page, and enforce this limit before or within `will_paginate`'s context.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Offset Calculation](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_offset_calculation.md)

*   **Description:** With extremely large datasets and very high page numbers, `will_paginate`'s internal calculations for determining the `OFFSET` in the database query could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow. This could lead to the database returning unexpected data or encountering errors.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity issues (incorrect data being displayed), application errors, potential for unexpected data access.
*   **Affected Component:** `will_paginate`'s internal offset calculation logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   While less direct control is available within `will_paginate` itself, ensure the underlying Ruby environment and database system are configured to handle large integers appropriately.
    *   Implement a reasonable maximum page limit in the application to prevent excessively large numbers from being passed to `will_paginate`.
    *   Consider the data types used for offset calculations within the application's interaction with `will_paginate` to ensure they can accommodate the expected range.
