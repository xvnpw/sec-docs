## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parameter Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Per Page Value -> Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parameter_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_per_page_value_-_attempt_extremely_large_per_page__5d1c23cb.md)

* Attack Vector: Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value
    * Description: The attacker crafts requests with an extremely large value for the `per_page` parameter.
    * Objective: To force the application to attempt to retrieve and process an excessive number of records.
    * Potential Impact: Can lead directly to Database Overload or Memory Exhaustion.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Significant to Critical
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parameter Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Per Page Value -> Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value -> Database Overload](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parameter_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_per_page_value_-_attempt_extremely_large_per_page__967a35be.md)

* Attack Vector: Database Overload
    * Description: By requesting a very large number of records, the attacker aims to overwhelm the database server with a resource-intensive query.
    * Objective: To degrade database performance, potentially leading to application slowdowns or complete database unavailability.
    * Potential Impact: Application slowdowns, errors, and potential outages.
    * Likelihood: Medium (conditional on successful "Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value")
    * Impact: Significant
    * Effort: Low (after initial parameter manipulation)
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parameter Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Per Page Value -> Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value -> Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parameter_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_per_page_value_-_attempt_extremely_large_per_page__7749e4d8.md)

* Attack Vector: Memory Exhaustion
    * Description: The attacker aims to force the application server to load a massive number of records into its memory, exceeding available resources.
    * Objective: To cause the application server to crash or become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.
    * Potential Impact: Application crashes and denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium (conditional on successful "Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value")
    * Impact: Significant
    * Effort: Low (after initial parameter manipulation)
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) -> Send Repeated Requests with Expensive Pagination Operations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_potential_for_denial_of_service__dos__-_send_repeated_requests_with_expensive_pagination_ope_b4f296af.md)

* Attack Vector: Send Repeated Requests with Expensive Pagination Operations
    * Description: The attacker sends a high volume of requests with pagination parameters designed to trigger resource-intensive operations (e.g., very large offsets, complex sorting combined with large page sizes).
    * Objective: To exhaust application server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) and render the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    * Potential Impact: Application slowdowns, errors, and complete unavailability (Denial of Service).
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Significant
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via will_paginate Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_will_paginate_vulnerabilities.md)

* Description: The attacker's ultimate goal.
    * Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the application and potentially underlying systems and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attempt Extremely Large Per Page Value](./attack_tree_paths/attempt_extremely_large_per_page_value.md)

* Description: The point at which the attacker attempts to retrieve an excessive amount of data.
    * Potential Impact: Direct trigger for Database Overload or Memory Exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Database Overload](./attack_tree_paths/database_overload.md)

* Description: The state where the database server is overwhelmed by the request, leading to performance degradation or failure.
    * Potential Impact: Application slowdowns, errors, and potential outages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/memory_exhaustion.md)

* Description: The state where the application server runs out of memory due to attempting to process too much data.
    * Potential Impact: Application crashes and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Repeated Requests with Expensive Pagination Operations](./attack_tree_paths/send_repeated_requests_with_expensive_pagination_operations.md)

* Description: The action of sending a high volume of resource-intensive pagination requests.
    * Potential Impact: Direct trigger for Denial of Service.
