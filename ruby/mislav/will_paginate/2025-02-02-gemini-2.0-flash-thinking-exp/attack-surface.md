# Attack Surface Analysis for mislav/will_paginate

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Tampering for Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive `per_page`](./attack_surfaces/parameter_tampering_for_denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive__per_page_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the `per_page` parameter to request an extremely large number of records per page, overwhelming the application and database, leading to a Denial of Service.

    *   **How will_paginate contributes to the attack surface:** `will_paginate` directly uses the `per_page` parameter to determine the number of records fetched in each paginated query.  Without proper limits, it allows users to request arbitrarily large datasets.

    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/?per_page=999999999`. When the application processes this request using `will_paginate`, it attempts to retrieve and render nearly a billion records. This can exhaust database resources, application server memory, and significantly slow down or crash the application for all users.

    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application downtime, severe performance degradation, potential server instability and crashes.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict `per_page` Limit:** Implement a **hard limit** on the maximum allowed value for the `per_page` parameter within your application. This limit should be set to a reasonable value that balances user experience with server capacity. Enforce this limit before passing the `per_page` value to `will_paginate`.
        *   **Input Validation and Rejection:**  Validate the `per_page` parameter to ensure it is a positive integer and within the defined acceptable range. Reject requests with `per_page` values exceeding the limit, returning an error to the user.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring for database and application server resource usage (CPU, memory, connections). Set up alerts to notify administrators of unusual spikes in resource consumption, which could indicate a DoS attack via `per_page` manipulation.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Aggressive):**  Consider implementing aggressive rate limiting specifically for requests involving pagination parameters, especially if DoS attacks via `per_page` are a significant concern.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect SQL Injection through Unsafe Dynamic Query Construction with Pagination](./attack_surfaces/indirect_sql_injection_through_unsafe_dynamic_query_construction_with_pagination.md)

*   **Description:**  While `will_paginate` itself doesn't directly cause SQL injection, it can become a component in an attack if developers incorrectly construct dynamic SQL queries *in conjunction with* `will_paginate` and fail to sanitize user-provided inputs used in those dynamic parts.

    *   **How will_paginate contributes to the attack surface:** `will_paginate` generates the base SQL query structure for pagination (LIMIT and OFFSET clauses). If the application then *adds* to this query dynamically using unsanitized user input (e.g., for filtering or ordering), the pagination context can become part of a larger SQL injection vulnerability.

    *   **Example:** An application allows users to sort paginated results by a column specified in a `sort_by` parameter. If the application naively inserts the `sort_by` parameter value directly into the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL query *alongside* `will_paginate`'s query generation, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code via the `sort_by` parameter. For instance, `?sort_by=id; DELETE FROM users; --`.

    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential complete takeover of the database server and potentially the application.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Use Parameterized Queries/ORM:**  **Never** construct dynamic SQL queries by directly concatenating user input strings.  Always use parameterized queries or your ORM's (like ActiveRecord in Rails) built-in features for safe query construction. These methods automatically handle input sanitization and prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Input Validation and Whitelisting for Dynamic Elements:** If dynamic query elements (like sort columns) are absolutely necessary, strictly validate and whitelist allowed values.  Ensure that user input is checked against a predefined set of safe options and rejected if it doesn't match.
        *   **Code Review and Static Analysis (SQL Injection Focus):** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically looking for dynamic SQL construction, especially in areas involving pagination and user-controlled parameters. Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Access):**  Grant the application database user only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Restrict write, delete, and administrative privileges to minimize the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
