# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the `will_paginate` Github repository, provides a Ruby gem that simplifies the implementation of pagination in Ruby on Rails applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - To provide a reusable and efficient solution for paginating data in web applications.
  - To improve user experience by allowing users to navigate large datasets in a structured and performant manner.
  - To reduce development time and effort required to implement pagination functionality in Rails projects.
  - To maintain a stable and reliable gem that is widely adopted and supported by the Ruby on Rails community.

- Business Risks:
  - Bugs in the pagination logic could lead to incorrect data display or application errors, impacting user experience and data integrity.
  - Performance issues in the pagination implementation could slow down applications and degrade user experience, especially with large datasets.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the gem could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or disrupt application functionality.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the gem becoming outdated or incompatible with newer versions of Rails, hindering its usability and adoption.
  - Dependency on this gem introduces a supply chain risk, where vulnerabilities in the gem itself or its dependencies could affect applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the gem (Implicit in open-source development on GitHub).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure the gem functions as expected (Implicit in good software development practices).
  - security control: Version control using Git (GitHub repository).
  - security control: Publicly accessible issue tracker on GitHub for reporting bugs and security vulnerabilities.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies of the gem.
  - accepted risk: Risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the gem code itself.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes and updates.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in gem dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development process to identify potential security flaws in the gem code.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including response time and communication strategy.
  - security control: Consider signing gem releases to ensure authenticity and integrity.
  - security control: Promote and encourage security audits of the gem by independent security researchers.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the `will_paginate` gem itself, as it is a library for pagination. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using the gem.
  - Authorization:
    - Authorization logic is the responsibility of the application using `will_paginate`. The gem should not bypass or interfere with application-level authorization controls. Pagination should only apply to data that the user is already authorized to access.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: The gem should validate input parameters related to pagination, such as page numbers and per-page limits, to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities. Input validation should be implemented within the gem to ensure robustness.
  - Cryptography:
    - Not directly applicable to the `will_paginate` gem itself. Cryptography is the responsibility of the application using the gem for securing sensitive data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Displaying paginated lists of data to users in Ruby on Rails applications. While seemingly simple, this is crucial for user experience in applications dealing with large datasets. Failure in this process can lead to usability issues, user frustration, and potentially impact business workflows that rely on accessing and navigating data.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The `will_paginate` gem itself does not handle or store any application-specific data. It is a library that assists in the presentation of data. The sensitivity of the data being paginated depends entirely on the application using the gem. It could range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data. The security risks associated with paginating data are therefore dependent on the context of the application where `will_paginate` is used. If the application handles sensitive data, then ensuring secure pagination is important to prevent information leakage or unauthorized access through pagination vulnerabilities (though unlikely in this gem itself, more in application logic around it).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What types of applications are most commonly using `will_paginate`? (e.g., e-commerce, content management systems, dashboards).
  - What is the typical size of datasets being paginated using this gem?
  - Are there any known security vulnerabilities reported or fixed in `will_paginate` in the past?
  - What is the process for reporting and fixing security vulnerabilities in `will_paginate`?
  - Is there a dedicated security team or person responsible for the security of `will_paginate`?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a stable, reliable, and easy-to-use pagination solution for Ruby on Rails applications. The project prioritizes community adoption and maintainability.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but the project relies on standard open-source development security practices. There is no dedicated security team, and security is addressed through community contributions and general software development best practices. Input validation within the gem is assumed to be present for core pagination parameters.
  - DESIGN: The gem is designed as a library to be integrated into Rails applications. It is deployed as part of the application deployment. The build process involves standard Ruby gem development and publishing practices, potentially using CI/CD for automation.
