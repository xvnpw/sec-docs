# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/will_paginate

## Threat: [No High or Critical Threats Directly from will_paginate](./threats/no_high_or_critical_threats_directly_from_will_paginate.md)

Based on the previous analysis, there are **no threats with High or Critical severity that are directly and solely introduced by the `will_paginate` gem itself.**

## Threat: [Application-level implementation flaws](./threats/application-level_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Application-level implementation flaws:**  Specifically, how developers handle user input (page parameters) and integrate pagination logic into their application.

## Threat: [General web application security concerns](./threats/general_web_application_security_concerns.md)

*   **General web application security concerns:** Such as authorization and DoS vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated but not directly caused by pagination libraries like `will_paginate`.

## Threat: [Parameter manipulation related to pagination can lead to Denial of Service](./threats/parameter_manipulation_related_to_pagination_can_lead_to_denial_of_service.md)

While parameter manipulation related to pagination can lead to Denial of Service, these are generally considered **Medium severity** as they are often mitigatable with standard input validation and rate limiting practices at the application level, and are not inherent critical vulnerabilities within the `will_paginate` gem's code.

## Threat: [Misuse of `will_paginate`](./threats/misuse_of__will_paginate_.md)

*   **Misuse of `will_paginate`:**  Incorrect implementation or lack of input validation in the application code that *uses* `will_paginate`.

## Threat: [Broader application security weaknesses](./threats/broader_application_security_weaknesses.md)

*   **Broader application security weaknesses:**  Unrelated to `will_paginate` but potentially exposed or amplified by pagination functionality.

## Threat: [Focus on overall application security posture](./threats/focus_on_overall_application_security_posture.md)

For a comprehensive security assessment, focus should be placed on the overall application security posture, including input validation, authorization, rate limiting, and general web application security best practices, rather than solely on the `will_paginate` gem itself.
