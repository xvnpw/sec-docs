## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Attack Goal: **Compromise Application using will_paginate** (Critical Node)

    └─── **1. Exploit Pagination Logic Vulnerabilities** (Critical Node)
        ├─── **1.1. Parameter Manipulation** (Critical Node)
        │   ├─── **1.1.1. Large Page Number Attack (DoS)** (Critical Node) - **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   │   └─── 1.1.1.1. Send requests with extremely high page numbers
        │   │       └─── Insight: Application might attempt to calculate offsets based on excessively large numbers, leading to performance degradation or resource exhaustion.
        │   └─── **1.1.5. Parameter Overflow/Integer Overflow (DoS/Error)** (Critical Node) - **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │       └─── 1.1.5.1. Send requests with extremely large integer page numbers exceeding system limits
        │           └─── Insight:  Could lead to integer overflow issues in backend calculations, potentially causing errors, crashes, or DoS.
        └─── **1.2. Inefficient Query Generation (DoS)** (Critical Node) - **HIGH-RISK PATH**
            ├─── **1.2.1. Exploit Complex Queries with Large Datasets** (Critical Node) - **HIGH-RISK PATH**
            │   └─── 1.2.1.1. Trigger pagination on endpoints with very large datasets and potentially complex filtering/sorting
            │       └─── Insight: `will_paginate` generates SQL queries with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.  For very large datasets and deep pagination (high page numbers), `OFFSET` can become inefficient in some database systems, leading to slow query execution and DoS.
            └─── **1.2.3. Pagination on Resource-Intensive Operations** (Critical Node) - **HIGH-RISK PATH**
                └─── 1.2.3.1. Trigger pagination on endpoints that perform resource-intensive operations beyond simple database queries (e.g., complex calculations, external API calls per item).
                    └─── Insight:  If each paginated item retrieval involves significant processing, even with efficient pagination queries, attackers can overload the server by requesting many pages, triggering these resource-intensive operations repeatedly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Large Page Number Attack (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/large_page_number_attack__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending requests with extremely high page numbers (e.g., `page=999999999`).
*   **Mechanism:**  Application attempts to calculate large `OFFSET` values in database queries, leading to performance degradation.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Availability loss) due to slow queries and resource exhaustion.
*   **Likelihood:** High - trivial to execute.
*   **Effort:** Low - minimal effort required.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - script kiddie level.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - easily detectable through web logs and performance monitoring.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement input validation to limit maximum page number.
    *   Consider efficient pagination techniques like cursor-based pagination for large datasets.
    *   Implement rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Overflow/Integer Overflow (DoS/Error)](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_overflowinteger_overflow__doserror_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending requests with extremely large integer page numbers that might exceed system limits.
*   **Mechanism:** Integer overflow in backend calculations related to page numbers and limits, potentially causing errors or crashes.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Availability loss), potential errors and unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - depends on system architecture and handling of large integers.
*   **Effort:** Low - easy to send large integer values.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - basic understanding of integer limits.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - errors and crashes might be logged, performance monitoring can reveal issues.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input validation to limit maximum page number to a safe range.
    *   Use appropriate data types in backend calculations to prevent integer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inefficient Query Generation (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/inefficient_query_generation__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the `OFFSET`-based pagination generated by `will_paginate` when used with large datasets and complex queries.
*   **Mechanism:**  `OFFSET` becomes inefficient for deep pagination, leading to slow database queries and increased load.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Availability loss) due to slow response times and database overload.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - depends on application's data volume and query complexity.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - requires identifying vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - basic understanding of database performance.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - might be initially mistaken for normal slow queries, requires performance monitoring.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   For large datasets, consider cursor-based pagination or other efficient methods.
    *   Optimize database queries and indexes.
    *   Implement caching for paginated results.
    *   Limit page size (`per_page`).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Complex Queries with Large Datasets](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_complex_queries_with_large_datasets.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting pagination on endpoints that retrieve very large datasets and involve complex filtering or sorting.
*   **Mechanism:** Combination of large datasets, complex queries, and `OFFSET`-based pagination exacerbates performance issues.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Availability loss) - severe performance degradation and potential database crash.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - requires identifying specific vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Effort:** Medium - requires some endpoint analysis.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - understanding of database query performance and application endpoints.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - requires monitoring of slow queries and database performance.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on efficient pagination strategies for these specific endpoints.
    *   Optimize complex queries and database indexes.
    *   Consider data partitioning or sharding for very large datasets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pagination on Resource-Intensive Operations](./attack_tree_paths/pagination_on_resource-intensive_operations.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering pagination on endpoints that perform resource-intensive operations for each paginated item.
*   **Mechanism:** Repeatedly executing resource-intensive operations for each page request, leading to server overload.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Availability loss) - server overload and slow response times.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - depends on application design and resource intensity of operations.
*   **Effort:** Low - easy to send multiple page requests once identified.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - basic understanding of web requests.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - might be harder to distinguish from legitimate heavy load initially, requires monitoring resource usage per endpoint.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Optimize resource-intensive operations (caching, background processing).
    *   Limit or disable pagination for such endpoints.
    *   Implement stricter rate limiting.
    *   Consider asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks.
