### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Application Directly Uses Unsanitized 'page' or 'per_page' in Raw SQL

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Description

This attack path highlights a critical security flaw where the application developers directly embed user-supplied values for the `page` or `per_page` parameters into raw SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

The `will_paginate` gem is designed to handle pagination logic, often involving database queries. While the gem itself provides mechanisms for safe query construction (e.g., through ActiveRecord or similar ORM methods), developers might bypass these and construct raw SQL strings, directly concatenating user input.

**The core problem is the lack of input validation and sanitization before incorporating user-controlled data into SQL queries.** This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code disguised as legitimate pagination parameters.

#### 4.2 Technical Explanation

Consider a scenario where the application fetches paginated data using a raw SQL query:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code Example (Illustrative)
def fetch_paginated_data(page, per_page)
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users LIMIT #{per_page} OFFSET #{(page.to_i - 1) * per_page.to_i}")
end

# Usage with user input (e.g., from query parameters)
user_page = params[:page]
user_per_page = params[:per_page]
results = fetch_paginated_data(user_page, user_per_page)
```

In this vulnerable example, if a user provides a malicious value for `params[:page]` or `params[:per_page]`, it will be directly inserted into the SQL query.

**Example Attack:**

An attacker could provide the following value for `params[:per_page]`:

```
10; DROP TABLE users; --
```

The resulting SQL query would become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10; DROP TABLE users; -- OFFSET ...
```

The database would execute the `SELECT` statement and then, critically, execute the `DROP TABLE users` command, potentially deleting the entire user table. The `--` comments out the rest of the intended query, preventing errors.

Similarly, malicious input in the `page` parameter can be used for various SQL injection attacks.

#### 4.3 Attack Scenario Analysis

Several attack scenarios can exploit this vulnerability:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can inject SQL to extract sensitive data from the database. For example, they could use `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database using `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `INSERT` statements.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some database configurations, attackers might be able to execute stored procedures or gain access to higher privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could inject queries that consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**  In certain scenarios, attackers might be able to manipulate the query to bypass authentication or authorization checks.

**Example Attack using `page` parameter:**

An attacker could provide the following value for `params[:page]`:

```
1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM admin_users --
```

Assuming the application displays the results of the query, the attacker could potentially retrieve usernames and passwords from the `admin_users` table.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack through unsanitized pagination parameters can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive user data, financial information, or other confidential data could be exposed.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise:**  Data could be modified or deleted, leading to inaccurate information and potential business disruption.
*   **Loss of Availability:**  The database or the entire application could become unavailable due to resource exhaustion or malicious data manipulation.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Recovery from a data breach, legal fees, and regulatory fines can result in significant financial losses.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, a data breach could lead to legal penalties and non-compliance issues (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

#### 4.5 Likelihood and Severity Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited is **high** if the application directly uses unsanitized input in raw SQL queries. Pagination parameters are often directly exposed in URLs, making them easily targetable. Automated tools and manual testing can readily identify such flaws.
*   **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is **critical**. Successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise, resulting in significant damage and potential business failure.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies

The development team must implement the following mitigation strategies to prevent this vulnerability:

1. **Avoid Raw SQL Construction with User Input:**  The most effective solution is to avoid constructing raw SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. This prevents SQL injection by separating the SQL structure from the user-provided values. Most database libraries and ORMs (like ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails) support parameterized queries.

    ```ruby
    # Secure Code Example using Parameterized Queries with ActiveRecord
    def fetch_paginated_data_secure(page, per_page)
      User.limit(per_page).offset((page.to_i - 1) * per_page.to_i)
    end
    ```

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation provides an additional layer of security. Validate that `page` and `per_page` are positive integers within acceptable ranges. Sanitize input by escaping potentially harmful characters if raw SQL construction is absolutely necessary (which is generally discouraged).

4. **Leverage ORM Features:**  Utilize the features provided by the ORM (like ActiveRecord) to handle pagination safely. Methods like `limit()` and `offset()` automatically handle parameterization and prevent SQL injection.

5. **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews to identify instances where raw SQL is being constructed with user input.

6. **Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and static/dynamic code analysis, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts, providing an additional layer of defense. However, it should not be considered a replacement for secure coding practices.

8. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. This limits the potential damage if an SQL injection attack is successful.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack tree path highlighting the direct use of unsanitized `page` or `per_page` parameters in raw SQL represents a significant security risk. This vulnerability can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate data, or disrupt the application's functionality.

The development team must prioritize implementing robust mitigation strategies, primarily focusing on using parameterized queries and avoiding the direct construction of raw SQL with user-provided input. Regular security testing and code reviews are crucial to ensure the application remains secure against SQL injection attacks. By addressing this critical vulnerability, the application can significantly improve its security posture and protect sensitive data.
