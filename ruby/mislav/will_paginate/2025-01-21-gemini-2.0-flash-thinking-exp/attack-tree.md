## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via will_paginate](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_will_paginate.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through vulnerabilities related to the `will_paginate` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate 'per_page' Parameter](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_'per_page'_parameter.md)

*   This node represents a critical control point. By manipulating the `per_page` parameter, an attacker can directly influence the amount of data the application attempts to retrieve and process, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Potential Code Vulnerabilities (Less likely, but possible)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_potential_code_vulnerabilities__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

*   This node highlights the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities within the `will_paginate` library itself. While less probable for a mature library, the impact of such a vulnerability could be widespread and severe, potentially allowing for remote code execution or other critical exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Application's Improper Usage of `will_paginate`](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_application's_improper_usage_of__will_paginate_.md)

*   This node represents a significant area of risk. It focuses on how developers integrate and utilize the `will_paginate` library. Improper usage, particularly the direct use of unsanitized pagination parameters in database queries, is a common source of critical vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable SQL Queries based on Pagination Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_sql_queries_based_on_pagination_parameters.md)

*   This node specifically points to the vulnerability where the application constructs SQL queries using user-controlled pagination parameters without proper sanitization. This is a direct pathway to SQL injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application directly uses unsanitized 'page' or 'per_page' in raw SQL](./attack_tree_paths/application_directly_uses_unsanitized_'page'_or_'per_page'_in_raw_sql.md)

*   This is the most critical point in the SQL injection attack path. It describes the specific coding flaw where user-provided input is directly embedded into SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Input Manipulation -> Manipulate 'per_page' Parameter -> Request extremely large 'per_page' value](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_input_manipulation_-_manipulate_'per_page'_parameter_-_request_extremely_large_'per_page'_47386172.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a request with an extremely large value for the `per_page` parameter.
*   **Impact:** This forces the application to attempt to retrieve and process an enormous amount of data from the database. This can lead to database overload, memory exhaustion on the server, and ultimately a Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Information Disclosure -> Bypass Access Controls via Pagination -> Manipulate 'page' or 'per_page' to access data beyond intended scope](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_information_disclosure_-_bypass_access_controls_via_pagination_-_manipulate_'page'_or_'pe_4b950d56.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the `page` or `per_page` parameters to navigate through data in a way that bypasses intended access controls. For example, they might increment the `page` number beyond the expected range to access data they are not authorized to view.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information that the attacker should not have access to, potentially violating data privacy and security policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Potential Code Vulnerabilities -> Discover vulnerabilities within `will_paginate` library itself -> Bugs in parameter parsing or SQL generation (if applicable internally)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_potential_code_vulnerabilities_-_discover_vulnerabilities_within__will_paginate__library__e4775bfa.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A sophisticated attacker identifies a previously unknown vulnerability within the `will_paginate` library's code. This could involve flaws in how the library parses input parameters or, less likely but potentially severe, issues in any internal SQL generation logic (though `will_paginate` primarily focuses on view logic).
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from application crashes and unexpected behavior to more severe consequences like remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Application's Improper Usage of `will_paginate` -> Vulnerable SQL Queries based on Pagination Parameters -> Application directly uses unsanitized 'page' or 'per_page' in raw SQL](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_application's_improper_usage_of__will_paginate__-_vulnerable_sql_queries_based_on_paginat_672bcbf3.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to properly sanitize or parameterize the `page` and `per_page` values when constructing SQL queries. An attacker then crafts malicious input for these parameters containing SQL code.
*   **Impact:** This leads to a SQL Injection vulnerability. The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the application's database, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, bypass authentication, or even execute operating system commands on the database server. This is a critical security flaw with potentially devastating consequences.
