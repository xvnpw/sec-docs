# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/will_paginate

## Threat: [Excessive Data Retrieval via `per_page` Parameter Manipulation](./threats/excessive_data_retrieval_via__per_page__parameter_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the `per_page` parameter in the URL to request an extremely large number of items per page. This forces the application to execute a resource-intensive database query and attempt to process a massive dataset.

**Impact:**
* Denial of Service (DoS) due to database overload or application server resource exhaustion.
* Increased database load and potential performance degradation for all users.
* Memory exhaustion on the application server.

**Affected Component:**
* `will_paginate`'s parameter parsing and query generation logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement server-side validation on the `per_page` parameter to enforce a reasonable maximum limit.
* Consider using a whitelist of allowed `per_page` values.
* Implement rate limiting on requests involving pagination parameters.
* Monitor database and application server resource usage for anomalies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `will_paginate`'s Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__will_paginate_'s_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `will_paginate` might rely on other libraries (dependencies) that have known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could indirectly affect applications using `will_paginate`.

**Impact:**
* Depends on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other security issues.

**Affected Component:**
* `will_paginate`'s dependency management (e.g., gemspec file).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit and update the application's dependencies, including `will_paginate` and its transitive dependencies.
* Use tools like `bundler-audit` (for Ruby) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Consider using dependency management tools that provide security scanning and alerts.
