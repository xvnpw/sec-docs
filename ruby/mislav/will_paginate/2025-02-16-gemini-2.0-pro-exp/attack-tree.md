## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.a. Excessive Page Number [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** The attacker provides an extremely large page number as a URL parameter (e.g., `?page=999999999`). This can cause the application to attempt to calculate a very large offset, potentially leading to performance issues or even crashes.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Attackers commonly test for vulnerabilities by providing extreme values.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Can range from slow response times to complete application unavailability.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low. Requires only modifying a URL parameter.
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No specialized knowledge is needed.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium. Unusually high page numbers might be logged, but could be overlooked without specific monitoring. Performance monitoring would likely detect the slowdown.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly validate the `page` parameter to be a positive integer.
        *   Enforce a reasonable maximum value for the `page` parameter.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent rapid submission of requests with different page numbers.

*   **1.b. Excessive Per-Page [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** The attacker provides a very large `per_page` value (e.g., `?per_page=9999999`). This forces the database to attempt to retrieve a massive number of records, potentially leading to database overload and a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Similar to excessive page numbers, this is a common attack technique.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can easily overwhelm the database and cause a DoS.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low. Modifying a URL parameter.
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium. Similar to excessive page numbers, it would likely be visible in logs and performance monitoring.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly validate the `per_page` parameter.
        *   Enforce a reasonable maximum value for `per_page` (e.g., 100, 500).
        *   Consider offering a predefined set of allowed `per_page` values.
        *   Implement rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure (Data Leak)](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosure__data_leak_.md)

*   **2.a. Unexpected Data Exposure through Parameter Manipulation [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates pagination parameters (`page`, `per_page`) in combination with *other* application logic flaws to bypass access controls.  This is *not* a direct `will_paginate` vulnerability, but a vulnerability in how the application *uses* the pagination parameters to determine which data to display.  For example, if the application uses the `page` parameter to incorrectly determine user group access, an attacker might access data from other groups.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium. Depends entirely on the presence of flaws in the application's access control logic.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High. Requires understanding the application's internal logic and identifying vulnerabilities in how it handles pagination.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of web application security principles and potentially some reverse engineering.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Might appear as legitimate user activity unless detailed access logs and intrusion detection systems are in place.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust access control logic that *does not* rely solely on pagination parameters.
        *   Verify user permissions *before* retrieving any data, regardless of the requested page or per-page value.
        *   Use secure session management and authentication mechanisms to determine what data a user is authorized to access.
        *   Input validation (as always) is important, but it's *not* sufficient on its own to prevent this type of attack. The core issue is flawed access control logic.
