# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/will_paginate

## Threat: [Excessive Data Exposure via `per_page` Manipulation](./threats/excessive_data_exposure_via__per_page__manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Excessive Data Exposure via `per_page` Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `per_page` parameter in the URL (e.g., `example.com/products?per_page=1000000`) to request an extremely large number of records per page.  They might do this by manually editing the URL, using automated tools, or crafting malicious links. `will_paginate` directly processes this parameter.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of a larger-than-intended dataset.
        *   Potential revelation of the total number of records in a table.
        *   Increased database load, potentially leading to performance degradation or even a denial-of-service (DoS) if combined with other factors.
        *   If combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., insufficient authorization checks), it could lead to unauthorized data access.
    *   **`will_paginate` Component Affected:**
        *   The `paginate` method (and its underlying implementation) in the model. This method *directly* processes the `per_page` parameter and uses it in the database query.
        *   View helpers that generate pagination links (e.g., `will_paginate` helper) – these helpers construct the URLs containing the `per_page` parameter, making the vulnerability exploitable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict `per_page` Validation:** Implement server-side validation to enforce a *hard* maximum allowed value for `per_page`.  Use a whitelist approach (e.g., `params[:per_page].to_i.clamp(1, 100)`).  Do *not* rely solely on client-side validation or the default `per_page` setting. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Configuration-Based Limit:** Define a global maximum `per_page` value in a configuration file (e.g., `config/initializers/will_paginate.rb`) and enforce it consistently across the application.
        *   **Database Query Optimization:** Ensure that database queries are optimized to handle large result sets efficiently, even if a large (but still within the allowed limit) `per_page` value is requested.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large `page` Parameter](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large__page__parameter.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Large `page` Parameter

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large `page` number in the URL (e.g., `example.com/products?page=999999999`).  They might do this manually, through automated tools, or by crafting malicious links. `will_paginate` directly uses this parameter to calculate the database offset.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   High database load, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability (DoS). This is the primary impact.
        *   Potential exhaustion of database connections or other resources.
        *   Degraded performance for all users of the application.
    *   **`will_paginate` Component Affected:**
        *   The `paginate` method in the model. This method *directly* processes the `page` parameter and calculates the database offset, which is the core of the vulnerability.
        *   View helpers that generate pagination links (e.g., `will_paginate` helper) – these helpers construct the URLs containing the `page` parameter, making the attack possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`page` Parameter Validation:** Implement server-side validation to limit the `page` parameter to a reasonable range.  While a strict maximum is data-dependent, set a practical upper bound based on expected data volume and monitor for abuse. This is crucial.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on pagination requests, especially for endpoints known to be resource-intensive. This can prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting very large page numbers.
        *   **Database Query Optimization:** Optimize database queries to handle large offsets efficiently.  Use appropriate indexing.  Consider using `EXPLAIN` (or your database's equivalent) to analyze query performance.
        *   **Keyset Pagination (Alternative):** For very large datasets, consider using keyset pagination (cursor-based pagination) instead of offset-based pagination.  This avoids the need to calculate large offsets, fundamentally mitigating this threat.  This would require a different pagination solution or a custom implementation, as `will_paginate` doesn't natively support it.
