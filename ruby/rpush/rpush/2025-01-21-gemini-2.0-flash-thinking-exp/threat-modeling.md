# Threat Model Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Notification Data in Storage](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_notification_data_in_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying storage mechanism used by `rpush` (e.g., database). This could be achieved through SQL injection vulnerabilities within `rpush`'s database interactions, insecure default database configurations used by `rpush`, or vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s data access layer. Once accessed, they could read sensitive notification data, including device tokens and notification content.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of user device tokens, potentially allowing for targeted attacks outside the application. Disclosure of notification content, which might contain personal or confidential information, leading to privacy violations.
*   **Affected Component:** `rpush` data storage (database interactions, data models).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure strong authentication and authorization for access to the `rpush` database.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the `rpush` storage.
    *   Regularly review and update database security configurations used by `rpush`.
    *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within `rpush` to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Rpush Administrative Interface](./threats/compromised_rpush_administrative_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weak authentication or authorization controls in the `rpush` administrative interface to gain unauthorized access. This could involve brute-forcing credentials, exploiting default credentials (if any are shipped with `rpush`), or leveraging vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s authentication mechanism. Once inside, they could view, modify, or delete notifications, configurations, and potentially send malicious notifications.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the push notification system, allowing for data manipulation, unauthorized notification sending, and potential disruption of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `rpush` administrative interface (authentication and authorization modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for administrative users of `rpush`.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative access to `rpush`.
    *   Restrict access to the `rpush` administrative interface to authorized personnel only (e.g., using IP whitelisting configured within `rpush` or at the network level).
    *   Regularly audit administrative user accounts and permissions within `rpush`.
    *   Disable or secure the administrative interface if it's not actively used.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Rpush](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_rpush.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the `rpush` instance with a large number of invalid or legitimate-looking notification requests, overwhelming the system and preventing it from processing legitimate notifications. This could be done by exploiting publicly accessible API endpoints exposed by `rpush` or by overwhelming the notification processing workers within `rpush`.
*   **Impact:** Inability to send push notifications, impacting application functionality and user engagement. Potential resource exhaustion on the server hosting `rpush`.
*   **Affected Component:** `rpush` API endpoints, notification processing workers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on notification submissions within `rpush` if configurable.
    *   Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the `rpush` instance to handle expected load and potential spikes.
    *   Consider using a queuing system in front of `rpush` to buffer incoming requests.
    *   Implement input validation within `rpush` to reject malformed or excessively large requests.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `rpush` relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by an attacker if not properly managed and updated. This could involve injecting malicious code or exploiting known security flaws within the context of the `rpush` application.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution on the server hosting `rpush`, data breaches affecting data processed by `rpush`, or denial of service of the `rpush` service.
*   **Affected Component:** `rpush` dependency management (e.g., Gemfile and its dependencies).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `rpush` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `rpush` and its dependencies.
