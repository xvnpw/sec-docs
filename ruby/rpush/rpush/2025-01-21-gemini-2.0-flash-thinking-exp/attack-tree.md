**Threat Model: Compromising Application Using rpush - High-Risk Sub-Tree**

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized control over the application's notification functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or manipulation of application users.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application Using rpush **[CRITICAL NODE]**
* Exploit rpush Server Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Exploit Known rpush Vulnerabilities
        * Identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in rpush versions
    * Exploit Unpatched Dependencies
        * Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in rpush's dependencies (e.g., Ruby gems)
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE) on rpush Server **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Execute arbitrary code on the rpush server, potentially gaining full control
* Compromise rpush Configuration/Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Access rpush Configuration Files
        * Gain unauthorized access to files containing rpush configuration (e.g., database credentials, API keys)
    * Intercept Communication with rpush Server
        * Intercept communication between the application and the rpush server to steal authentication tokens or credentials
* Compromise Underlying Notification Providers (Indirect via rpush) **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Steal APNs/FCM Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Gain access to the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) credentials stored within rpush configuration
    * Abuse Compromised APNs/FCM Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * If APNs/FCM credentials are compromised, directly send malicious notifications bypassing the application's intended logic

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using rpush [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_rpush__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal and a critical node because its achievement signifies a successful breach of the application's notification system, potentially leading to various negative consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit rpush Server Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rpush_server_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This path represents attacks directly targeting the rpush server software. It's critical because successful exploitation can grant the attacker significant control over the notification infrastructure.
    * **Exploit Known rpush Vulnerabilities:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed security flaws in specific versions of rpush. This often involves using readily available exploit code.
    * **Exploit Unpatched Dependencies:** rpush relies on external libraries (dependencies). If these libraries have known vulnerabilities and are not updated, attackers can exploit them to compromise the rpush server.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on rpush Server [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is a highly critical attack where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting rpush. This grants them complete control over the server and potentially the entire application infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise rpush Configuration/Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rpush_configurationcredentials__critical_node_.md)

* This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information used by rpush. It's critical because these credentials can be used to impersonate the application and control notification sending.
    * **Access rpush Configuration Files:** Attackers attempt to gain access to files where rpush stores its configuration, which often includes database credentials, API keys for notification providers (APNs, FCM), and potentially rpush-specific authentication tokens. This could be achieved through techniques like exploiting web server vulnerabilities, insecure file permissions, or insider threats.
    * **Intercept Communication with rpush Server:** Attackers try to eavesdrop on the communication between the application and the rpush server. If this communication is not properly encrypted (e.g., using TLS/HTTPS), attackers can intercept authentication tokens or credentials being exchanged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Underlying Notification Providers (Indirect via rpush) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_underlying_notification_providers__indirect_via_rpush___critical_node_.md)

* This path involves indirectly compromising the notification delivery services (APNs for iOS, FCM for Android) by targeting the credentials stored within rpush. It's critical because it allows attackers to bypass the application's logic and directly manipulate notifications.
    * **Steal APNs/FCM Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers aim to steal the API keys or certificates required to authenticate with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). These credentials are often stored within rpush's configuration files.
    * **Abuse Compromised APNs/FCM Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once the APNs or FCM credentials are in the attacker's possession, they can directly send push notifications to the application's users without needing to go through the application's intended notification sending process. This allows for sending malicious notifications, spam, or phishing attempts, completely bypassing the application's security controls.
