# Attack Surface Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Attack Surface: [Crafted Notification Payloads](./attack_surfaces/crafted_notification_payloads.md)

**Attack Surface: Crafted Notification Payloads**
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious content within push notification payloads sent through Rpush.
    * **How Rpush Contributes:** Rpush acts as the delivery mechanism for these payloads. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate the payload content before sending it through Rpush, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a push notification with a specially crafted URL that, when opened by the user, redirects them to a phishing site or exploits a vulnerability in the mobile application.
    * **Impact:**  Phishing attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities in the receiving application, potential for data breaches or malware installation on user devices.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization of all data included in push notification payloads before sending them through Rpush.
        * Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers or similar mechanisms within the receiving application to restrict the actions that can be performed based on the notification content.
        * Educate users about the risks of clicking on links in push notifications from unknown or suspicious sources.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Push Notification Provider Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_push_notification_provider_credentials.md)

**Attack Surface: Compromised Push Notification Provider Credentials**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to the API keys or certificates used by Rpush to communicate with push notification providers (APNs, FCM, etc.).
    * **How Rpush Contributes:** Rpush requires these credentials to function. If these credentials are not securely managed, they become a target.
    * **Example:** API keys are stored in plain text in configuration files or are accidentally committed to a public repository. An attacker finds these keys and can send unauthorized push notifications on behalf of the application.
    * **Impact:**  Sending unauthorized push notifications, potentially for malicious purposes (spam, phishing), disruption of the legitimate notification service, and potential reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store push notification provider credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
        * Implement strict access controls to limit who can access these credentials.
        * Regularly rotate API keys and certificates.
        * Monitor for unauthorized usage of the push notification provider accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Rpush Admin Interface (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_rpush_admin_interface__if_enabled_.md)

**Attack Surface: Unauthorized Access to Rpush Admin Interface (if enabled)**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the administrative interface of Rpush (if it's enabled and exposed).
    * **How Rpush Contributes:** Rpush provides an optional admin interface for managing notifications and devices. If not properly secured, it becomes an entry point.
    * **Example:** The default credentials for the Rpush admin interface are not changed, or the interface is exposed without proper authentication, allowing an attacker to log in and manipulate notifications or device data.
    * **Impact:**  Viewing sensitive information about push notifications and devices, creating and sending unauthorized notifications, potentially disrupting the notification service, and gaining insights into the application's user base.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure strong, unique credentials are used for the Rpush admin interface.
        * Implement multi-factor authentication for the admin interface.
        * Restrict access to the admin interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        * Consider disabling the admin interface in production environments if it's not actively needed.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the dependencies used by the Rpush gem.
    * **How Rpush Contributes:** Rpush relies on other Ruby gems. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through Rpush.
    * **Example:** A dependency used by Rpush has a known security flaw that allows for remote code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interacting with Rpush in a specific way.
    * **Impact:**  Various, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the server running Rpush.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Rpush and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency scanning tools (like Bundler Audit or Dependabot) to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
