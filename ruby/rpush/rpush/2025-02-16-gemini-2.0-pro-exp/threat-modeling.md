# Threat Model Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Threat: [Unauthorized Notification Sending (Spoofing)](./threats/unauthorized_notification_sending__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Rpush's configuration data, specifically the API keys and certificates stored within the `Rpush::App` records in the Rpush database.  This allows the attacker to directly utilize the `Rpush::Notification` object creation and sending mechanisms within Rpush to dispatch arbitrary notifications, impersonating the legitimate application. The attacker bypasses application-level controls by interacting directly with Rpush's internal components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Users receive spam or malicious notifications.
    *   **Financial Loss:** Potential for phishing or fraud.
    *   **Data Breach:** If combined with other vulnerabilities, could lead to data exposure.
    *   **Denial of Service (User Experience):** Flooding users with notifications.

*   **Rpush Component Affected:**
    *   `Rpush::App`:  Compromised credentials within the `Rpush::App` records allow impersonation.
    *   `Rpush::Notification`:  The attacker directly uses this class to create and send malicious notifications.
    *   Rpush Database: The database storing `Rpush::App` and `Rpush::Notification` records is the direct target.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Never hardcode credentials. Use environment variables, secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted configuration files.  This prevents direct access to the credentials even if the database is compromised.
    *   **Database Security:** Strong passwords, access control lists (ACLs), encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, principle of least privilege. This protects the Rpush database itself.
    *   **API Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys and certificates used by Rpush.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Rpush logs (specifically for successful and failed notification creation) and database access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Notification Content Modification (Tampering)](./threats/notification_content_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the data within a `Rpush::Notification` object *after* it has been created by the application but *before* Rpush delivers it to the push notification service. This requires compromising the Rpush process itself or the communication channel *if* Rpush is running as a separate process. This is a more sophisticated attack than simply gaining database access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misinformation:** Attackers can spread false information.
    *   **Phishing:** Modified notifications can contain malicious links.
    *   **Application Misuse:** Altered notifications could trigger unintended actions.

*   **Rpush Component Affected:**
    *   `Rpush::Notification`: The `data` and other attributes of the notification object are directly manipulated.
    *   Rpush process memory (if compromised).
    *   Inter-process communication (if Rpush is a separate process).

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use TLS/SSL for any inter-process communication between the application and Rpush (if they are separate processes).
    *   **Gem Integrity:** Verify the integrity of the Rpush gem using checksums or digital signatures to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
    *   **Process Isolation:** If running Rpush as a separate process, consider running it in a sandboxed or containerized environment to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    * **Memory Protection:** Consider using memory protection techniques if available on the platform.

## Threat: [Exposure of Device Tokens (Information Disclosure)](./threats/exposure_of_device_tokens__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:**  The Rpush database, specifically the table containing `Rpush::Notification` records (which include device tokens), is compromised.  The attacker gains direct access to the stored device tokens. This allows the attacker to send notifications to those devices *without* needing to compromise Rpush's configuration or the application logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Notification Sending:** Attackers can send notifications to compromised devices.
    *   **Loss of Control:** The application loses control over notification delivery.

*   **Rpush Component Affected:**
    *   Rpush Database: The table storing `Rpush::Notification` records, and thus device tokens, is the direct target.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Security:** Strong passwords, ACLs, encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, principle of least privilege. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Token Encryption (Consideration):** Implement custom encryption/decryption of device tokens *within your application* before storing/retrieving them from the Rpush database. This adds complexity but significantly increases security.
    * **Token Revocation:** Implement token revocation and update Rpush database.

## Threat: [Rpush Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/rpush_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Rpush process itself with a high volume of notification requests. This directly impacts Rpush's ability to process legitimate notifications, regardless of application-level controls. The attacker targets Rpush's internal queues and processing capabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Service Disruption:** Legitimate users do not receive notifications.
    *   **Application Unavailability:** If Rpush is a critical component, the entire application may become unresponsive.

*   **Rpush Component Affected:**
    *   The entire Rpush process, including its internal queues and worker threads.
    *   Database connections used by Rpush.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Rpush Configuration):** If Rpush offers built-in rate limiting (check the gem's documentation and configuration options), configure it appropriately. This is the most direct mitigation.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Rpush's CPU, memory, and database connection usage. Set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   **Scalability:** Design the Rpush deployment to be scalable (e.g., using multiple Rpush instances with a load balancer). This allows Rpush to handle higher loads.
    *   **Queue Management:** Ensure Rpush's internal queues are properly configured (size limits, timeouts) to prevent them from growing unbounded.
