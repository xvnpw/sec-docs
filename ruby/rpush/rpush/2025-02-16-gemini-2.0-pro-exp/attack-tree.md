```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. [[Compromise Rpush Database]]](./attack_tree_paths/1____compromise_rpush_database__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Rpush database, which stores device tokens, notification history, and potentially other sensitive application data.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Data breach, data modification, potential full database control, ability to send malicious notifications)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in SQL queries (especially custom ones added by the application developer) to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code review of all custom SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [==1.2 Weak Database Credentials==](./attack_tree_paths/==1_2_weak_database_credentials==.md)

*   **Description:** Using easily guessable, default, or reused passwords for the database user that Rpush connects with.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie

*    **Impact:** Varies, but can be Very High depending on the specific exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[3.3 Configuration Errors]]](./attack_tree_paths/__3_3_configuration_errors__.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect settings or insecure configurations within Rpush, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but can be Very High.

## Attack Tree Path: [==3.3.1 Incorrect APNs/FCM sandbox/production settings==](./attack_tree_paths/==3_3_1_incorrect_apnsfcm_sandboxproduction_settings==.md)

*   **Description:** Using the wrong environment (sandbox vs. production) for push notification providers.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully review and document environment settings.
    *   Thorough testing before deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[3.3.2 Missing or weak authentication for Rpush admin interface (if exposed)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__3_3_2_missing_or_weak_authentication_for_rpush_admin_interface__if_exposed___.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the Rpush web interface without proper authentication or with weak credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* expose the admin interface publicly without strong authentication.
    *   Disable the interface if it's not needed.
    *   Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Restrict access to specific IP addresses.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[3.3.3 Insecure storage of provider credentials (APNs certificates, FCM API keys)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__3_3_3_insecure_storage_of_provider_credentials__apns_certificates__fcm_api_keys___.md)

*   **Description:** Storing APNs certificates, FCM API keys, or other provider credentials in an insecure manner (e.g., hardcoded, in unencrypted configuration files, in version control).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   *Never* store credentials in source code or unencrypted files.
    *   Regularly rotate credentials.
    *   Monitor for credential leaks.
    *   Restrict access to credentials based on the principle of least privilege.
