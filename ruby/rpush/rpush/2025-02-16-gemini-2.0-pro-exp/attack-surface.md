# Attack Surface Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Push Service Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_push_service_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain access to the API keys/secrets used by `rpush` to authenticate with external push notification services (APNs, FCM, etc.).

**Rpush Contribution:** `rpush` *requires* and *uses* these credentials to function.  The security of these credentials is *paramount* to the security of the push notification system, and `rpush` is the direct user of them.

**Example:** An attacker finds the APNs certificate and key file (.p12) accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository, or obtains them through a server misconfiguration exposing environment variables that `rpush` reads.

**Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized sending of arbitrary push notifications to all users.
    *   Potential access to limited data within the push service provider's dashboard (depending on the provider).
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Potential legal and financial consequences.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager). *Never* store credentials in source code, configuration files, or easily accessible environment variables.
    *   **Regular Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating API keys and certificates.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the credentials used by `rpush` have the *minimum* necessary permissions.
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the secrets management system.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Rpush or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_rpush_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of the `rpush` gem or its *direct* dependencies that contains known security vulnerabilities *within the gem itself or its direct dependencies*.

**Rpush Contribution:** The vulnerability exists *within* `rpush` code or the code of a gem that `rpush` directly depends on and uses. This is *not* about vulnerabilities in the *application* using `rpush`, but in `rpush` itself.

**Example:** An older version of `rpush` has a known vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks *within rpush's internal handling of requests*, or a dependency like an older `net-http` version used by `rpush` has a known TLS vulnerability.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the context of rpush's operations*.

**Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `rpush` and all its *direct* dependencies up-to-date. Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Bundler) to manage and update gems.  Pay close attention to security releases.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `bundler-audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to *specifically* check `rpush` and its declared dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to `rpush` and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Push Service Rate Limiting/DoS (on Push Service) - *Modified for Direct Rpush Involvement*](./attack_surfaces/push_service_rate_limitingdos__on_push_service__-_modified_for_direct_rpush_involvement.md)

**Description:** `Rpush`, due to *its own internal misconfiguration or bugs*, sends excessive requests to the push notification service, exceeding rate limits and causing service disruption. This differs from the previous version by focusing on issues *within rpush* rather than the application using it.

**Rpush Contribution:** The excessive requests originate from `rpush`'s internal handling, *not* from the application's logic calling `rpush` correctly. This could be due to a bug in `rpush`'s retry logic, batching mechanism, or connection management.

**Example:** A bug in `rpush`'s connection pooling causes it to open too many connections to the push service, exceeding connection limits. Or, a flaw in `rpush`'s retry logic causes it to retry failed requests excessively, even when the push service is returning permanent error codes.

**Impact:**
    *   Push notifications are delayed or fail to be delivered.
    *   The application's account with the push service provider may be temporarily or permanently suspended.
    *   Disruption of service for all users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rpush Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review `rpush`'s configuration, paying close attention to settings related to connection pooling, retries, and batch sizes. Ensure these are set to reasonable values that respect the push service's limits.
    *   **Testing:** Conduct load testing and stress testing *specifically targeting rpush's interaction with the push service* to identify potential issues with its internal handling of requests.
    *   **Monitoring (Rpush Internals):** If possible, monitor `rpush`'s internal metrics (e.g., number of open connections, retry counts) to detect anomalies. This might require patching `rpush` or using specialized monitoring tools.
    * **Update Rpush:** Ensure the latest version of `rpush` is used, as bugs related to rate limiting might have been fixed in newer releases.
