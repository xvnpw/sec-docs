### High and Critical Rpush Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the `rpush` gem.

*   **Threat:** Plaintext Storage of Provider Credentials
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within `rpush`'s configuration handling could lead to the storage of push notification provider credentials (APNs certificates, FCM server keys) in plaintext within `rpush`'s configuration files or database. An attacker gaining access to the server or database could retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized push notifications sent to users, potential for phishing or malicious content delivery, damage to application reputation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management (specifically how `RPUSH.APNS.CERTIFICATE`, `RPUSH.FCM.API_KEY`, etc. are handled within `rpush`'s code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `rpush` should be configured to support and enforce the use of secure secret management solutions or environment variable encryption.
        *   Developers should avoid directly configuring credentials in plaintext within `rpush`'s configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Administrative Credentials
    *   **Description:** If `rpush` includes a web-based administrative interface, it might ship with default or weak credentials. An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to manage and monitor the `rpush` instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the `rpush` system, potential for data breaches (viewing notification data), service disruption, and unauthorized notification sending.
    *   **Affected Component:** Administrative Interface (if present within `rpush`), Authentication module within `rpush`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `rpush` should enforce a secure initial setup process requiring users to change default credentials.
        *   `rpush` should implement strong password policies for administrative accounts.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Notification Data in Storage
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s data storage implementation or lack of proper access controls within `rpush` could allow an attacker with access to the underlying database to read sensitive information about notifications, including their content and recipient device tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of potentially sensitive user data, including notification content and device identifiers. This could lead to privacy violations or further targeted attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Storage (database interactions managed by `rpush`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `rpush` should implement robust access controls to its database schema and data.
        *   `rpush` should encrypt sensitive data at rest within its managed storage.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering in Storage
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s data storage implementation could allow an attacker with access to the `rpush` database to modify notification content, delivery status, or device token information managed by `rpush`.
    *   **Impact:** Delivery of incorrect or malicious notifications, disruption of notification services, potential for misinformation or harm to users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Storage (database interactions managed by `rpush`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `rpush` should implement mechanisms to ensure data integrity within its storage.
        *   `rpush` should implement audit logging for data modifications within its storage.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** `rpush` relies on various third-party libraries and gems. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the `rpush` instance.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution within the `rpush` process, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependencies (gems and libraries used by `rpush`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain `rpush` with up-to-date dependencies.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Communication with Push Notification Providers
    *   **Description:**  Outdated or misconfigured network communication within `rpush` could lead to insecure connections with APNs, FCM, or other push notification providers, potentially exposing sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks on communication with push notification providers, potentially exposing notification content or credentials handled by `rpush`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Push Notification Dispatchers (communication logic within `rpush` for interacting with APNs, FCM, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `rpush` should enforce the use of secure communication protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) for all interactions with push notification providers.
        *   `rpush` should validate SSL/TLS certificates of push notification providers.
