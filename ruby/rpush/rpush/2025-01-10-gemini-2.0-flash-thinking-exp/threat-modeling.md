# Threat Model Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Threat: [Exposure of APNs/FCM Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_apnsfcm_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the sensitive credentials (API keys, certificates, passwords) required by `rpush` to connect to APNs and FCM. This could happen through vulnerabilities in how `rpush` handles or stores these credentials, such as insecure storage mechanisms within `rpush` itself or insufficient protection during the credential loading process.

**Impact:** The attacker can send unauthorized push notifications to the application's users, potentially for malicious purposes like phishing, spreading misinformation, or causing annoyance. They can also potentially impersonate the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `rpush` utilizes secure methods for accessing credentials, such as relying on environment variables with proper permissions or integrating with secure secrets management libraries.
* Avoid configuring credentials directly within `rpush` configuration files if possible, opting for secure external sources.
* Regularly review and update the methods `rpush` uses to handle and access credentials.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of rpush Settings](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_rpush_settings.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigured settings *within* `rpush` to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the service. This could involve overly permissive access controls for the `rpush` management interface that are inherent to `rpush`'s design or implementation, or insecure default configurations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `rpush` management interface could allow attackers to view, modify, or delete notifications, manage applications and devices, potentially disrupting the notification service or accessing sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the default configuration options provided by `rpush` and change any that are insecure.
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the `rpush` management interface as recommended by `rpush`'s documentation.
* Restrict network access to the `rpush` management interface to trusted networks.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to rpush Management Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_rpush_management_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the web-based management interface provided directly by `rpush`. This could be due to vulnerabilities in `rpush`'s authentication implementation, weak default credentials set by `rpush`, or insufficient authorization checks within the interface code.

**Impact:** Ability to view, modify, or delete notifications, manage applications and devices, potentially disrupting the notification service or accessing sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Change default credentials for the `rpush` management interface immediately upon installation.
* Implement strong password policies for users accessing the `rpush` management interface.
* Consider implementing multi-factor authentication if supported by `rpush` or through an external authentication proxy.
* Ensure proper authorization checks are in place within the `rpush` management interface to restrict access based on user roles.
