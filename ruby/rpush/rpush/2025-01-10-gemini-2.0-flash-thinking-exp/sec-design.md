## 5. Data Flow

The typical sequence of events for sending a push notification through rpush is as follows:

1. An **'External Application/Service'** sends a notification request to the **'API Gateway'**.
2. The **'API Gateway'** authenticates and authorizes the request.
3. The **'API Gateway'** routes the validated request to the **'Core Application'**.
4. The **'Core Application'** validates the request, enriches the notification data (if needed), and stores the notification details in the **'Database'**.
5. The **'Core Application'** queues the notification for processing by the **'Background Workers'**, typically using a message queue.
6. A **'Background Worker'** retrieves the next notification from the queue.
7. The **'Background Worker'** identifies the appropriate **'Push Notification Provider'** based on the target device's platform.
8. The **'Background Worker'** formats the notification payload according to the provider's specific API requirements.
9. The **'Background Worker'** sends the formatted notification to the **'Push Notification Provider'**.
10. The **'Push Notification Provider'** attempts to deliver the notification to the target **'Mobile Device'**.
11. The **'Push Notification Provider'** sends delivery feedback (success or failure) to the **'Background Worker'**.
12. The **'Background Worker'** updates the notification status in the **'Database'** based on the feedback.
13. The **'Web UI'** can query the **'Database'** to display notification status and analytics to administrators.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

A common deployment architecture for rpush involves the following elements, often deployed in a cloud environment:

* **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the API Gateway and Web UI for high availability and scalability.
* **API Gateway Instances:** Multiple instances of the API Gateway to handle incoming API requests concurrently, improving performance and resilience.
* **Web UI Instances:** Multiple instances of the Web UI to serve user requests, ensuring availability and responsiveness.
* **Core Application Instances:** Multiple instances of the Core Application to handle the processing of API requests and business logic. These instances are typically stateless and can be scaled horizontally.
* **Background Worker Instances:** Multiple instances of the Background Workers to process the notification queue concurrently. The number of workers can be dynamically scaled based on the notification volume.
* **Message Queue (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka):**  Provides asynchronous communication between the Core Application and Background Workers, decoupling components and improving resilience.
* **Database Cluster (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra):** A highly available and scalable database cluster to store persistent data. Replication and backups are crucial for data durability.
* **Cache Layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached):**  Optional caching layer to improve performance by caching frequently accessed data, such as application settings or device information.
