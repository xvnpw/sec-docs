## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Key Weakness (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Bypass Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_key_weakness__high-risk_path__critical_node_bypass_authenticationauthorization_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and leverage weak, default, or insecurely stored API keys.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Default Keys:** Rpush might be deployed with default API keys that are publicly known or easily guessable.
    * **Insecure Storage:** API keys might be stored in easily accessible locations like client-side code, configuration files without proper encryption, or in version control systems.
    * **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers might attempt to guess API keys through brute-force or by using lists of common keys.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation grants attackers full, unauthorized access to the Rpush API, allowing them to perform any action the API permits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Unauthorized Notifications to Users (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Exploit Rpush API)](./attack_tree_paths/send_unauthorized_notifications_to_users__high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_rpush_api_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers, having bypassed authentication, use the Rpush API to send unsolicited or malicious notifications to application users.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Spam/Annoyance:** Sending a large volume of unwanted notifications can disrupt the user experience.
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Notifications can be crafted to lure users to malicious websites or trick them into revealing sensitive information.
    * **Malware Distribution:** Notifications can contain links to download malware or exploit vulnerabilities on user devices.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Sending inappropriate or offensive content can severely damage the application's reputation.
* **Impact:** Ranges from user annoyance and inconvenience to significant security breaches and reputational harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Exploits (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Exploit Rpush Internal Logic)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_exploits__high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_rpush_internal_logic_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party Ruby gems or underlying libraries used by Rpush.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    * **Outdated Dependencies:** Rpush might be using outdated versions of gems or libraries that contain known security flaws.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** In some cases, attackers might compromise the dependencies themselves.
* **Impact:** Can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Rpush server.
    * **Data Breaches:** Exposing sensitive notification data, API keys, or other information.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the Rpush service or making it unavailable.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Allowing attackers to gain higher levels of access within the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configuration (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Exploit Rpush Internal Logic)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configuration__high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_rpush_internal_logic_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weak or default configuration settings in Rpush or its underlying components.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords for Rpush itself, the database, or other related services.
    * **Weak Passwords:** Setting easily guessable passwords.
    * **Open Ports/Services:** Leaving unnecessary ports or services exposed.
    * **Insecure Permissions:** Incorrect file or directory permissions allowing unauthorized access.
* **Impact:** Can provide attackers with easy access to the Rpush system, its data, or the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Rpush Database (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Compromise Rpush Infrastructure)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rpush_database__high-risk_path__critical_node_compromise_rpush_infrastructure_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the database used by Rpush.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Direct Database Exposure:** The database server might be directly accessible from the internet or an untrusted network.
    * **Weak Database Credentials:** Using weak or default passwords for the database user.
    * **SQL Injection:** Although less likely with modern frameworks, vulnerabilities in Rpush's database interaction logic could be exploited.
    * **Exploiting Database Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the database software itself.
* **Impact:**  Provides attackers with access to all sensitive information stored in the database, including:
    * **API Keys:** Allowing them to impersonate the application and send unauthorized notifications.
    * **Device Tokens:** Potentially enabling them to send notifications directly to user devices, bypassing Rpush.
    * **Notification Content:** Exposing potentially sensitive information contained within notifications.
    * **User Data (if stored):** Depending on the application's design, user data might also be present.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Rpush Server (High-Risk Path, Critical Node: Compromise Rpush Infrastructure)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rpush_server__high-risk_path__critical_node_compromise_rpush_infrastructure_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain control of the server hosting the Rpush application.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Exploiting OS Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the server's operating system.
    * **Exploiting Ruby Environment Vulnerabilities:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the Ruby interpreter or related components.
    * **Compromising Services Running on the Server:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in other services running on the same server.
    * **Gaining Access through Weak Credentials:** Exploiting default or weak passwords for system accounts.
* **Impact:** Complete control over the Rpush server allows attackers to:
    * **Access and Modify Data:** Including notification data, API keys, and potentially other application data.
    * **Disrupt Service:** Shut down or interfere with the operation of Rpush.
    * **Install Malware:** Use the compromised server as a platform for further attacks.
    * **Pivot to Other Systems:** Potentially use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
