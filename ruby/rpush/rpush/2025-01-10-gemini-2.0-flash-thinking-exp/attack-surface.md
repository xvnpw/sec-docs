# Attack Surface Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Push Notification Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_push_notification_credentials.md)

**Description:** The credentials required for `rpush` to communicate with push notification gateways (APNs certificates/keys, FCM server keys) are stored insecurely.

**How rpush Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rpush` requires these credentials to function. If the application deploying `rpush` doesn't handle these credentials securely, it creates a vulnerability directly related to `rpush`'s operational needs.

**Example:** Storing APNs certificates or FCM server keys in plaintext configuration files that are directly used by `rpush` or accessible to processes running `rpush`.

**Impact:** An attacker gaining access to these credentials could impersonate the application and send unauthorized push notifications, potentially damaging the application's reputation or being used for malicious purposes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Secure Credential Storage:** Utilize secure storage mechanisms for sensitive credentials, such as environment variables specifically designed for secrets, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files that `rpush` can decrypt securely.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that only the `rpush` process and necessary administrative users have access to these credentials.
- **Regular Rotation of Credentials:** Periodically rotate push notification credentials as a security best practice for `rpush`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of rpush Background Workers](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_rpush_background_workers.md)

**Description:** The background workers used by `rpush` (e.g., with Sidekiq or Resque) are not configured securely.

**How rpush Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rpush` relies on these background workers to process and send notifications. Vulnerabilities in the worker system directly impact `rpush`'s ability to function securely.

**Example:** The Redis instance used by Sidekiq for `rpush` is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access to the job queue where `rpush`'s notification tasks are stored. An attacker could inject malicious jobs or interfere with `rpush`'s notification delivery process.

**Impact:** Denial of service for push notifications managed by `rpush` by manipulating the job queue, potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the `rpush` worker processes, and disruption of notification delivery.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Secure the Underlying Job Queue:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for the message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) used by `rpush`'s background workers. Configure network access controls to restrict access to the message broker.
- **Principle of Least Privilege for Worker Processes:** Run `rpush`'s worker processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
- **Input Validation in Worker Processes:** While less direct, ensure that the application logic feeding jobs to `rpush` workers sanitizes data to prevent potential issues within the worker context.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through rpush's Admin Interface (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_rpush's_admin_interface__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If `rpush`'s admin interface is enabled and not properly secured, it can expose sensitive information managed by `rpush`.

**How rpush Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rpush` provides this interface, and its security is directly the responsibility of the `rpush` setup and configuration.

**Example:** An attacker could access the `rpush` admin interface using default credentials or by exploiting a vulnerability within the interface itself, gaining access to device tokens, notification history managed by `rpush`, or `rpush`'s configuration details.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive user data (device tokens stored within `rpush`), insights into application usage patterns related to push notifications, and potential for further attacks based on the exposed information managed by `rpush`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Disable the Admin Interface in Production:** If the `rpush` admin interface is not actively needed for operational purposes in a production environment, disable it entirely.
- **Strong Authentication and Authorization for Admin Interface:** If the `rpush` admin interface is necessary, enforce strong, unique passwords and implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms specific to the `rpush` admin interface.
- **Regular Security Audits of the Admin Interface:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities within the `rpush` admin interface.
