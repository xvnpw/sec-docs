# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Environment Variables for Sensitive `rpush` Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_environment_variables_for_sensitive__rpush__credentials.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Environment Variables for Sensitive `rpush` Credentials
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Sensitive `rpush` Credentials:**  Specifically list sensitive credentials used *by `rpush`*, such as:
        *   APNS Certificate Paths and Passwords used in `rpush` configuration.
        *   FCM Server Keys used in `rpush` configuration.
        *   Database Credentials used by `rpush` to connect to its database (username, password).
    *   **Step 2: Configure `rpush` to Use Environment Variables:** Modify your `rpush` configuration files (e.g., `rpush.yml`, initializer files) to load these sensitive values from environment variables instead of hardcoding them.  For example, in `rpush.yml`:
            ```yaml
            apns:
              certificate: <%= ENV['RPUSH_APNS_CERTIFICATE_PATH'] %>
              certificate_password: <%= ENV['RPUSH_APNS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD'] %>
            ```
    *   **Step 3: Set Environment Variables for `rpush`:** Ensure that the environment where `rpush` runs (server, container, etc.) has these environment variables defined. Use secure methods for managing environment variables in your deployment environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hardcoded `rpush` Credentials Exposure (High Severity):** Sensitive credentials required for `rpush` to operate (like APNS/FCM keys or database passwords) are not embedded directly in the application code or configuration files, reducing the risk of exposure if the codebase is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hardcoded `rpush` Credentials Exposure (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exposing `rpush`-specific credentials by separating them from the application's codebase and configuration files.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Database credentials for `rpush` are loaded from environment variables in `database.yml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   APNS and FCM certificates/keys paths and passwords used by `rpush` are currently stored in configuration files within the application directory. These should be moved to environment variables prefixed (e.g., `RPUSH_`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to `rpush` Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to__rpush__configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to `rpush` Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `rpush` Configuration Files:** Locate all configuration files *specifically used by `rpush`*, such as `rpush.yml`, and any initializer files that configure `rpush` settings.
    *   **Step 2: Apply File System Permissions to `rpush` Configuration Files:**  On the server where `rpush` is deployed, set file system permissions on these configuration files to restrict access.
        *   Ensure only the user running the `rpush` process and authorized administrators have read access.
        *   Restrict write access to only the user running `rpush` and authorized administrators.
        *   Remove any public read or write permissions.
    *   **Step 3: Verify `rpush` Configuration File Permissions:** Regularly check the permissions of `rpush` configuration files to ensure they remain correctly configured, especially after deployments or system updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `rpush` Configuration (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from reading `rpush` configuration files, which might contain sensitive information or configuration details that could be exploited.
    *   **`rpush` Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification of `rpush` configuration files, which could lead to service disruption, unauthorized notification sending, or other security issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `rpush` Configuration (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized individuals gaining access to sensitive `rpush` configuration details.
    *   **`rpush` Configuration Tampering (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of malicious or accidental modification of `rpush` settings.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `rpush` configuration files are deployed with default file permissions set by deployment scripts, which are generally restrictive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit process to regularly audit and verify file permissions specifically on `rpush` configuration files after deployment or system updates. A script or manual checklist for verification should be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Rotate `rpush` API Keys and Certificates](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_rotate__rpush__api_keys_and_certificates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Rotate `rpush` API Keys and Certificates
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Rotatable `rpush` Credentials:** Determine which API keys and certificates used *by `rpush` for push notification services* should be rotated regularly. This primarily includes:
        *   APNS certificates used by `rpush`.
        *   FCM server keys used by `rpush`.
    *   **Step 2: Define Rotation Schedule for `rpush` Credentials:** Establish a rotation schedule specifically for these `rpush`-related credentials (e.g., APNS certificates yearly, FCM keys every 6 months).
    *   **Step 3: Automate `rpush` Credential Rotation (if possible):** Automate the process of rotating `rpush`'s API keys and certificates. This might involve:
        *   Using APIs provided by APNS/FCM to generate new keys/certificates for `rpush`.
        *   Developing scripts to automatically update `rpush` configuration with the new credentials.
        *   Automating the deployment of updated `rpush` configurations.
    *   **Step 4: Manual `rpush` Credential Rotation Procedure (if automation is not feasible):** If automation is not fully possible, create a detailed manual procedure for rotating `rpush`'s credentials, including steps for:
        *   Generating new APNS certificates and FCM server keys for `rpush`.
        *   Updating the `rpush` configuration files with the new credentials.
        *   Deploying the updated `rpush` configuration.
        *   Revoking or deactivating old `rpush` credentials (if supported by the service).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised `rpush` Credentials (Medium Severity):** If an API key or certificate used by `rpush` is compromised, regular rotation limits the time window for an attacker to misuse these credentials to send unauthorized push notifications via `rpush`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised `rpush` Credentials (Medium Impact):** Reduces the impact of compromised `rpush`-specific credentials by limiting their validity period.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No automated or scheduled key/certificate rotation is currently implemented for `rpush` credentials.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement a process for regular rotation of APNS certificates and FCM server keys used by `rpush`. Start with manual rotation on a defined schedule and explore automation options.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Storage for `rpush` APNS Certificates and Keys
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Avoid Direct Codebase Storage of `rpush` Certificates:**  Do not store APNS certificates and private keys used by `rpush` directly within the application's codebase or in publicly accessible directories.
    *   **Step 2: Encrypted Storage for `rpush` Certificates (Recommended):** Store `rpush`'s APNS certificates and keys in encrypted storage. Options include:
        *   **Encrypted File System:** Use an encrypted file system partition or volume to store `rpush`'s certificate files.
        *   **Dedicated Secret Management System:** Utilize a secret management system (like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to securely store and retrieve `rpush`'s certificates.
    *   **Step 3: Secure File Permissions for `rpush` Certificates (if using file system):** If storing `rpush`'s certificates as files (even encrypted), apply strict file permissions to limit access as described in "Restrict Access to `rpush` Configuration Files".
    *   **Step 4: Secure Transfer of `rpush` Certificates:** When transferring `rpush`'s certificates to the server, use secure channels (SCP, SFTP, TLS).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `rpush` Certificates/Keys (High Severity):** If `rpush`'s APNS certificates and private keys are stored insecurely, unauthorized access could allow attackers to impersonate your application and send push notifications via `rpush`.
    *   **Accidental Exposure of `rpush` Certificates (Medium Severity):** Insecure storage increases the risk of accidental exposure of `rpush`'s certificates.
*   **Impact:**
