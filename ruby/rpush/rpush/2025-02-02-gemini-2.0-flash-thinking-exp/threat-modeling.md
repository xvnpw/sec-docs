# Threat Model Analysis for rpush/rpush

## Threat: [Exposure of Device Tokens](./threats/exposure_of_device_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `rpush` database (e.g., through SQL injection in the application, database misconfiguration, or compromised infrastructure). They extract device tokens stored in the database.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can send unauthorized push notifications to users, potentially for spam, phishing, or malware distribution. Reputational damage to the application.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Database (data storage)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the database infrastructure with strong access controls and encryption.
    *   Regularly audit database security configurations.
    *   Consider encrypting device tokens at the application level before storing them in `rpush`.
    *   Implement robust access control mechanisms for accessing the `rpush` database.

## Threat: [Exposure of `rpush` Configuration and Logs](./threats/exposure_of__rpush__configuration_and_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to `rpush` configuration files or logs through misconfigured file permissions, insecure server configuration, or application vulnerabilities. They extract sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or internal application details.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of push notification infrastructure, potential access to backend systems if credentials are leaked, information leakage about application architecture, enabling further attacks.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Configuration files, Logging system
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store configuration files with restricted file system permissions.
    *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management for sensitive configuration.
    *   Implement proper log rotation and access control for `rpush` logs.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive information in plain text.
    *   Secure `rpush`'s web interface (if enabled) with strong authentication.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to `rpush` Admin Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to__rpush__admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If the `rpush` admin interface is enabled and not properly secured, an attacker can brute-force credentials or exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can manipulate push notifications, send spam or malicious notifications, modify `rpush` configuration, disrupt the service, potentially gain further access to the system.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Admin Interface (if enabled)
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the exposure and functionalities of the admin interface) - *Included as potentially High depending on context.*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Protect the admin interface with strong authentication (multi-factor authentication).
    *   Implement robust authorization to restrict access to administrative functionalities.
    *   Disable the admin interface in production if not actively used.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions for the admin interface.

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If `rpush` uses a SQL database and is vulnerable, an attacker injects malicious SQL code through input fields (more likely in custom extensions or integrations than core `rpush`).
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database, DoS, potential remote code execution depending on database configuration.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Database interaction modules, potentially custom extensions
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Regularly update `rpush` and its dependencies.
    *   Perform security code reviews and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If `rpush` or custom extensions execute external commands based on user-controlled input, command injection vulnerabilities could arise (less likely in core `rpush`).
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the `rpush` server, system compromise, full control over the server.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Potentially custom extensions or integrations that execute external commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid executing external commands based on user-controlled input.
    *   If necessary, carefully sanitize and validate input to prevent command injection.
    *   Use secure coding practices to minimize the risk of command injection.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Push Notification Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_push_notification_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Push notification credentials (APNS certificates, FCM API keys) are stored insecurely (plain text in config files, version control).
*   **Impact:** Attackers can impersonate your application and send unauthorized push notifications, damaging reputation, potentially sending malicious notifications, financial costs.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Configuration management, Credential storage
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management solutions, or encrypted configuration files.
    *   Restrict access to credential storage locations.
    *   Regularly rotate push notification credentials.

## Threat: [Compromised `rpush` Gem or Distribution](./threats/compromised__rpush__gem_or_distribution.md)

*   **Description:** The `rpush` gem itself or its distribution channels are compromised, injecting malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data breaches, widespread impact across applications using the compromised gem.
*   **Affected Rpush Component:** Gem distribution, Core `rpush` code
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted sources for downloading `rpush` gem.
    *   Verify gem integrity using checksums or digital signatures.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning to ensure consistent versions.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies and software supply chain.
