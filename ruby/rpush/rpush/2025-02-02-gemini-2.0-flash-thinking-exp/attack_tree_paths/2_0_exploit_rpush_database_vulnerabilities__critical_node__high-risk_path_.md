---

###### 2.1.2.a Database Accessible from Public Network [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]

**Description:** This critical node highlights a severe misconfiguration where the database server is directly accessible from the public internet without proper access controls. This drastically increases the risk of unauthorized access from anywhere in the world.

**Risk Level:** Critical Node, High-Risk

**Attack Vector:**

1.  **Port Scanning:** Attacker scans public IP ranges for open database ports (e.g., 5432, 3306).
2.  **Direct Connection Attempt:** If a database port is open, the attacker attempts to connect directly to the database server from the public internet.
3.  **Exploitation of Default Credentials or Known Vulnerabilities:** If default credentials are in use or the database software has known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these to gain access. Even with strong passwords, exposure to the public internet significantly increases the attack surface and the likelihood of successful attacks over time.

**Impact:** Direct and unrestricted access to the database from the public internet, making it highly vulnerable to all types of database attacks, including brute-force, credential stuffing, and exploitation of database vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Network Segmentation (Primary Mitigation):**  **Crucially, ensure the database server is NOT directly accessible from the public internet.** Place the database server on a private network (e.g., within a Virtual Private Cloud or behind a firewall).
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to block all public internet access to the database ports. Allow access only from authorized internal networks (e.g., application servers).
*   **VPN or Bastion Host:** If remote database administration is required, use a VPN or bastion host to securely access the database server from the internet, rather than directly exposing the database.
*   **Regular Port Scanning (Defensive):** Periodically scan your public IP addresses to ensure no database ports are unintentionally exposed.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor for and block unauthorized access attempts to the database from the public internet.

##### 2.1.3 SQL Injection (if application logic around Rpush exposes DB to SQLi - less directly Rpush's fault, but relevant in context) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** While `rpush` itself is designed to interact with the database securely, applications built around `rpush` might introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if they directly interact with the `rpush` database using dynamically constructed SQL queries based on user input without proper sanitization. This path highlights the risk of SQL injection in application code that extends or interacts with `rpush`.

**Risk Level:** High-Risk Path

**Mitigation Strategies (General for 2.1.3):**

*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices, particularly regarding SQL injection prevention.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and remediate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in application code.

###### 2.1.3.a Exploit SQLi in Application Code Interacting with Rpush's DB [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This critical node focuses on the specific scenario where application code, designed to interact with the `rpush` database (e.g., for custom reporting, data analysis, or extensions), is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Risk Level:** Critical Node

**Attack Vector:**

1.  **Identify Application Endpoints Interacting with Rpush DB:** Attacker identifies application endpoints or functionalities that interact with the `rpush` database, especially those that take user input and use it in database queries.
2.  **Inject Malicious SQL:** Attacker crafts malicious SQL injection payloads within user input fields (e.g., form fields, API parameters) that are processed by the vulnerable application code.
3.  **Bypass Input Validation (if weak):** Attackers attempt to bypass any weak input validation or sanitization implemented by the application.
4.  **Execute Arbitrary SQL Queries:** If successful, the injected SQL code is executed by the database server, allowing the attacker to:
    *   **Bypass Authentication and Authorization:** Gain access to data they are not authorized to see.
    *   **Read Sensitive Data:** Extract data from any table in the database, including notification payloads, configuration data, and potentially other application data if stored in the same database.
    *   **Modify Data:** Insert, update, or delete data in the database.
    *   **Execute Stored Procedures:** Potentially execute stored procedures with elevated privileges.
    *   **In some cases, gain Operating System access (depending on database server configuration and privileges).**

**Impact:**  Similar to direct database access, successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements (Strongest Mitigation):**  **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when constructing SQL queries in application code. This prevents SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user inputs before using them in database queries. Sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially malicious characters. **However, input validation alone is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection and should be used in conjunction with parameterized queries.**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User for Application):** Grant the application database user only the minimum necessary privileges required for its intended functionality. Avoid granting `SELECT *`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` privileges on all tables if not absolutely necessary.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns. WAFs can provide an additional layer of defense but should not be relied upon as the primary mitigation.
*   **Regular Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Regularly test application code for SQL injection vulnerabilities using SAST and DAST tools.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database activity for suspicious queries that might indicate SQL injection attempts.
