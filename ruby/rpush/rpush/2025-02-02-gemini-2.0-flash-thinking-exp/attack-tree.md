        *   **1.1.1.a Brute-force/Guess Default Keys [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker attempts to guess common default API keys or brute-force weak keys if default keys are not changed.
            *   **Impact:** Successful bypass grants full unauthorized access to the Rpush API, allowing sending, modifying, or deleting notifications, potentially disrupting service or sending malicious notifications.
        *   **1.1.1.b Find Exposed Keys (e.g., in code, config files, logs) [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker searches for API keys hardcoded in application source code, configuration files, or inadvertently logged in server logs.
            *   **Impact:**  Similar to brute-force, exposed keys grant unauthorized API access.

*   **1.2 Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **1.2.1 SQL Injection (if Rpush API interacts with DB directly and unsafely):**
        *   **1.2.1.a Inject SQL via Notification Payload Parameters [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within notification payload parameters that are processed by the Rpush API without proper sanitization and are directly used in database queries.
            *   **Impact:**  Successful SQL injection can lead to:
                *   Data Breach: Accessing sensitive data in the Rpush database (notification content, device tokens, user data if stored).
                *   Data Manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
                *   Privilege Escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access to the database server.
    *   **1.2.2 Command Injection (less likely in core Rpush, but possible in extensions/customizations):**
        *   **1.2.2.a Inject Commands via Notification Payload Parameters if processed unsafely [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If Rpush extensions or custom code process notification payloads in a way that involves executing system commands based on payload content without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
            *   **Impact:** Successful command injection can lead to:
                *   System Compromise: Executing arbitrary commands on the server hosting Rpush, potentially gaining full control.
                *   Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data from the server.

        *   **1.2.3.a Inject NoSQL queries via Notification Payload Parameters [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If Rpush or application code uses a NoSQL database and constructs queries dynamically based on notification payload parameters without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious NoSQL queries.
            *   **Impact:** Similar to SQL injection, NoSQL injection can lead to:
                *   Data Breach: Accessing sensitive data in the NoSQL database.
                *   Data Manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.

            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker floods the Rpush API with a massive number of notification requests, overwhelming the server and its resources.
            *   **Impact:**  Service disruption, making the Rpush API and potentially the entire application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **1.3.2 Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Payloads:**
        *   **1.3.2.a Send Notifications with Extremely Large Payloads [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker sends notifications with excessively large payloads, consuming server bandwidth, memory, and processing power, leading to resource exhaustion.
            *   **Impact:** Service degradation, slow response times, potential server crashes, and denial of service.

*   **1.4 Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **1.4.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Notification Content (less direct impact on Rpush itself, but on applications displaying notifications):**
        *   **1.4.1.a Inject Malicious Scripts in Notification Payload (if displayed without sanitization in application UI) [HIGH-RISK - Application Side]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the notification payload. If the application displaying these notifications does not properly sanitize the content before rendering it in a user's browser, the script will execute.
            *   **Impact:** Client-side compromise, allowing the attacker to:
                *   Steal user session cookies and credentials.
                *   Deface the application UI.
                *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
                *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **1.4.3 Buffer Overflow/Integer Overflow (less likely in Ruby, but theoretically possible in native extensions or dependencies):**
        *   **1.4.3.a Send Payloads Designed to Cause Buffer/Integer Overflows [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts specific payloads designed to exploit potential buffer overflow or integer overflow vulnerabilities in Rpush's native extensions or dependencies (if any exist and are vulnerable).
            *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to:
                *   System Crash: Causing the Rpush process or even the entire server to crash.
                *   Code Execution: In some cases, buffer overflows can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

        *   **1.5.1.a Trigger Errors to Reveal Sensitive Information (e.g., DB schema, internal paths) [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intentionally triggers errors in the Rpush API or application to observe error messages. If error handling is not properly configured, these messages might reveal sensitive information like database schema details, internal file paths, or component versions.
            *   **Impact:** Information leakage that can aid further attacks by providing attackers with insights into the system's internal workings.
    *   **1.5.2 Insecure Logging [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **1.5.2.a Logs Expose API Keys, Secrets, or Notification Content [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Rpush or application logging configurations might inadvertently log sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, or the content of notifications themselves in plain text.
            *   **Impact:** Credential leakage and data breach if logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals.

    *   **4.1.1 Default Configuration Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **4.1.1.a Default Credentials or Insecure Default Settings Left Unchanged [HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Rpush or its components might have default configuration settings, including default credentials (e.g., for admin interfaces or internal services). If these defaults are not changed after installation, attackers can exploit them.
            *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative interfaces or internal services, potentially leading to full system compromise.

            *   **Attack Vector:** Configuration files containing sensitive information (API keys, database passwords) are accidentally exposed through the web server (e.g., due to misconfiguration or lack of proper access controls) or are accessible due to other system misconfigurations.
            *   **Impact:** Credential leakage and exposure of sensitive configuration settings.
    *   **4.1.3 Hardcoded Secrets in Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **4.1.3.a API Keys, Database Passwords Hardcoded in Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Developers hardcode sensitive secrets like API keys or database passwords directly into configuration files instead of using secure secret management practices.
