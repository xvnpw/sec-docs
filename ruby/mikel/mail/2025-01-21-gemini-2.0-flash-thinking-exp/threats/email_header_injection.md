### Deep Analysis of Email Header Injection Threat

#### Introduction

Email Header Injection is a serious security vulnerability that can arise when an application uses user-provided data to construct email headers without proper sanitization. The `mail` gem, while providing powerful tools for email handling, can be susceptible to this vulnerability if developers directly use the `Mail::Message#header` method with untrusted input. This analysis delves into the specifics of this threat within the context of the `mail` gem.

#### Technical Deep Dive

The core of the vulnerability lies in the way email headers are structured according to RFC 5322. Headers consist of a field name, a colon, and a field body, separated by carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`). The end of the header section is indicated by an empty line (`\r\n\r\n`).

The `Mail::Message#header` method in the `mail` gem allows setting arbitrary headers. If an attacker can inject newline characters (`\r\n`) into data passed to this method, they can effectively terminate the current header and inject new, malicious headers.

**Example of Vulnerable Code:**

```ruby
require 'mail'

def send_email(to, subject, body, extra_headers)
  mail = Mail.new do
    to      to
    from    'noreply@example.com'
    subject subject
    body    body
  end

  extra_headers.each do |name, value|
    mail.header[name] = value
  end

  mail.deliver_now
end

# Potentially vulnerable usage:
user_supplied_headers = { 'X-Custom-Header' => params[:custom_header] }
send_email('recipient@example.com', 'Hello', 'This is the email body.', user_supplied_headers)
```

If `params[:custom_header]` contains `evil: malicious value\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, the resulting headers would be:

```
To: recipient@example.com
From: noreply@example.com
Subject: Hello
X-Custom-Header: evil: malicious value
Bcc: attacker@example.com
```

The attacker has successfully injected a `Bcc` header, potentially allowing them to intercept the email.

#### Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Attackers can exploit Email Header Injection through various input points in an application that constructs emails:

*   **Form Fields:**  User-provided data from web forms intended for email-related information (e.g., feedback forms, contact forms).
*   **API Parameters:** Data passed through API endpoints used for sending emails.
*   **Configuration Settings:**  Less common, but if user-controlled configuration settings are used to build headers.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Spam and Phishing:** Injecting `Bcc` or `Cc` headers to send unsolicited emails or phishing attempts through the application's email infrastructure, potentially damaging the application's reputation and leading to blacklisting.
*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Adding recipients (e.g., via `Bcc`) to emails without the sender's knowledge, leading to privacy breaches.
*   **Email Routing Manipulation:** Injecting headers like `Return-Path` or `Reply-To` to control where replies are sent or to spoof the sender's address more effectively.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:**  Injecting headers to circumvent spam filters or other email security mechanisms.

#### Impact Assessment (Detailed)

The impact of a successful Email Header Injection attack can be significant:

*   **Reputation Damage:**  If the application is used to send spam or phishing emails, the application's domain and IP address can be blacklisted, hindering legitimate email delivery.
*   **Security Breaches:** Unauthorized disclosure of information through injected `Bcc` recipients can lead to serious privacy violations and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the application if it is perceived as a source of spam or a tool for malicious activities.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  Sending large volumes of spam can consume significant server resources and potentially lead to increased costs.
*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the nature of the injected emails and the data involved, the application owner could face legal and compliance penalties.

#### Code Analysis (Mail Gem)

The `Mail::Message#header` method in the `mail` gem provides a direct way to set headers. While powerful, it requires careful handling of input to prevent injection attacks. The gem itself doesn't automatically sanitize input passed to this method, placing the responsibility on the developer.

On the other hand, the `mail` gem's dedicated methods for setting standard headers like `to`, `from`, `subject`, `cc`, and `bcc` perform necessary escaping and validation to prevent header injection. This is why the primary mitigation strategy emphasizes using these built-in methods.

Looking at the source code (simplified example):

```ruby
# Simplified representation of Mail::Message#header
module Mail
  class Message
    def header
      @header ||= Header.new
    end

    class Header
      def []=(field, value)
        # Directly sets the header without automatic sanitization
        fields << "#{field}: #{value}\r\n"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This simplified example illustrates that `Mail::Message#header` directly appends the provided value to the header string, making it vulnerable to newline injection.

#### Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing Email Header Injection:

1. **Always use the `mail` gem's built-in methods for setting headers:** This is the most effective and recommended approach. Methods like `mail.to = 'recipient@example.com'`, `mail.subject = 'Hello'`, `mail.bcc = 'attacker@example.com'` handle the necessary escaping and prevent attackers from injecting newline characters to create new headers.

    **Example of Secure Code:**

    ```ruby
    require 'mail'

    def send_email_secure(to, subject, body, bcc_recipient = nil)
      mail = Mail.new do
        to      to
        from    'noreply@example.com'
        subject subject
        body    body
        bcc     bcc_recipient if bcc_recipient
      end
      mail.deliver_now
    end

    # Secure usage:
    send_email_secure('recipient@example.com', 'Hello', 'This is the email body.', params[:bcc_email])
    ```

    In this secure example, if `params[:bcc_email]` contains newline characters, they will be treated as part of the BCC address and not as header separators.

2. **Strictly sanitize and validate any user-provided data that is used in email headers before passing it to `Mail::Message#header`:** If using `Mail::Message#header` is absolutely necessary for custom headers, rigorous sanitization is essential. This involves:

    *   **Removing or encoding newline characters (`\r` and `\n`):** Replace them with a safe alternative or remove them entirely.
    *   **Input validation:**  Define strict rules for the format and content of custom headers and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated library for header encoding:** While the `mail` gem handles standard headers, for complex custom header scenarios, a library specifically designed for header encoding might be beneficial.

    **Example of Sanitization (Illustrative - consider more robust methods):**

    ```ruby
    require 'mail'

    def send_email_with_custom_header(to, subject, body, custom_header_value)
      sanitized_header_value = custom_header_value.gsub(/[\r\n]/, '') # Remove newline characters

      mail = Mail.new do
        to      to
        from    'noreply@example.com'
        subject subject
        body    body
        header['X-Custom-Header'] = sanitized_header_value
      end
      mail.deliver_now
    end

    # Usage with sanitization:
    send_email_with_custom_header('recipient@example.com', 'Hello', 'This is the email body.', params[:custom_header])
    ```

    **Important Note:**  Sanitization can be complex and error-prone. **Prioritizing the use of the `mail` gem's built-in methods is the safest approach.** Only resort to direct header manipulation with extreme caution and thorough sanitization.

#### Prevention Best Practices

Beyond the specific mitigation strategies, consider these broader best practices:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid granting unnecessary access to email sending functionalities.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks of header injection and other email security vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   **Input Validation Everywhere:**  Apply input validation not just for email headers but for all user-provided data.
*   **Consider using a dedicated email sending service:** Services like SendGrid or Mailgun often provide additional security features and handle header construction securely.

#### Conclusion

Email Header Injection is a significant threat that can have severe consequences for applications using the `mail` gem. Understanding the technical details of the vulnerability, potential attack vectors, and the importance of proper mitigation is crucial for building secure email functionality. By consistently utilizing the `mail` gem's built-in methods for setting headers and rigorously sanitizing any necessary direct header manipulation, development teams can effectively prevent this vulnerability and protect their applications and users.
