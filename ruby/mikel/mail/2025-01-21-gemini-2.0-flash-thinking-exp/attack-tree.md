## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise via Malicious Email Reception/Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_via_malicious_email_receptionparsing__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Email Parsing Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Trigger Buffer Overflow in Header Parsing: Crafting emails with excessively long headers to exploit potential buffer overflows in the parsing logic.
        * Application uses vulnerable version of 'mail' or has custom parsing logic: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions of the `mail` gem or flaws in custom-implemented parsing logic.
        * Exploit MIME Parsing Vulnerabilities: Sending emails with malformed or deeply nested MIME structures to confuse the parser and potentially trigger vulnerabilities.
        * Inject Malicious Content via Headers: Injecting CRLF sequences for header injection or malicious scripts/code into custom headers processed by the application.
        * Exploit Content-Type Handling Issues: Sending emails with misleading or incorrect Content-Type headers to bypass security checks or trigger incorrect content interpretation.

* **Exploit Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Send email with malicious attachments (e.g., malware, exploits): Attaching executable files or documents containing malware or exploits to compromise the application server or user machines.
        * Craft attachments with filenames containing special characters leading to path traversal: Using specially crafted filenames to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
        * Application automatically processes attachments without proper security checks: Exploiting the automatic processing of attachments without malware scanning or sandboxing.

* **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Send email with serialized malicious objects in the body or headers: Embedding serialized objects containing malicious code within the email content.
        * Application deserializes email content without proper validation: Exploiting the lack of validation during the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code.
        * Exploit known vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries used by the application: Targeting known security flaws in the deserialization libraries used by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise via Malicious Email Generation/Sending [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_via_malicious_email_generationsending__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit SMTP Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Inject SMTP commands via email fields (To, From, Subject, Body): Injecting raw SMTP commands into email fields to manipulate the email sending process, potentially sending emails to unintended recipients or gaining access to the SMTP server.
        * Manipulate email routing or recipient lists: Altering the intended recipients of emails.
        * Gain unauthorized access to the SMTP server or send spam: Using SMTP injection to relay spam or potentially gain control of the SMTP server.

* **Exploit Template Injection in Email Generation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Inject malicious code into email templates used by the application: Embedding malicious code within email templates that gets executed when the template is rendered.
        * Execute arbitrary code on the server when the email is rendered: Achieving remote code execution by exploiting template injection vulnerabilities.
        * Steal sensitive data from the application's environment: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information during template rendering.

* **Exploit Insecure Handling of Email Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Access stored email credentials (e.g., hardcoded, insecurely stored): Gaining access to email credentials stored insecurely within the application's codebase or configuration.
        * Use compromised credentials to send malicious emails: Utilizing compromised credentials to send unauthorized emails, potentially impersonating legitimate users or the application.
        * Impersonate legitimate users or the application itself: Sending emails that appear to originate from trusted sources to conduct phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

* **Exploit Lack of Email Verification/Signing [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Send spoofed emails that appear to originate from the application: Sending emails with forged sender addresses to make them appear legitimate.
        * Phish users or trick them into performing malicious actions: Using spoofed emails to deceive users into revealing sensitive information or performing harmful actions.
        * Damage the application's reputation: Sending malicious emails that are falsely attributed to the application, damaging its reputation and user trust.
