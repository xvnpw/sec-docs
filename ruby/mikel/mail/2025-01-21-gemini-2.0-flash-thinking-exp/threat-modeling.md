# Threat Model Analysis for mikel/mail

## Threat: [Spoofing of Sender Address](./threats/spoofing_of_sender_address.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `From`, `Sender`, or `Reply-To` headers in an outgoing email to make it appear as though it originated from a legitimate user or the application itself. This can be done by directly setting these headers using `Mail::Message#header` or similar methods provided by the `mail` gem.
*   **Impact:**  Damaged reputation for the application and its users, successful phishing attacks targeting recipients who trust the forged sender, potential legal repercussions due to impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** `Mail::Message#header`, `Mail::Message#from`, `Mail::Message#sender`, `Mail::Message#reply_to`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for the sending domain.
    *   Avoid directly using user-provided data to set critical sender headers without strict validation.

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary email headers by including newline characters (`\r\n`) within user-provided data that is used to construct email headers. This is possible if the application directly uses methods like `Mail::Message#header` with unsanitized input.
*   **Impact:**  Sending spam or phishing emails through the application's infrastructure, unauthorized information disclosure by adding unintended recipients, potential manipulation of email routing.
*   **Affected Component:** `Mail::Message#header`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always** use the `mail` gem's built-in methods for setting headers (e.g., `Mail::Message#to=`, `Mail::Message#subject=`, etc.) which automatically handle escaping.
    *   Strictly sanitize and validate any user-provided data that is used in email headers before passing it to `Mail::Message#header`.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Attachment Handling](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_attachment_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `Mail::Message#add_file` or `Mail::Part#body` to handle attachments, vulnerabilities within these components of the `mail` gem could be exploited if not used correctly or if the gem itself has a flaw.
*   **Impact:**  Distribution of malware or ransomware to recipients, potential compromise of recipient systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `Mail::Message#add_file`, `Mail::Part#body`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust file upload validation and virus scanning on the server-side before attaching files using the `mail` gem.
    *   Keep the `mail` gem updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities in attachment handling.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Email Content](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_email_content.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses the `mail` gem to construct emails, and due to coding errors, sensitive information is included in the email body or attachments managed by the `mail` gem's API.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, privacy violations, potential misuse of exposed credentials.
*   **Affected Component:**  `Mail::Message#text_part.body`, `Mail::Message#html_part.body`, `Mail::Message#add_file`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review the data being included in emails before setting the body or adding attachments using the `mail` gem's methods.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code.

## Threat: [Insecure SMTP Configuration](./threats/insecure_smtp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application configures the `Mail::SMTP` delivery method with insecure settings, such as disabling TLS or using weak authentication, making the communication vulnerable to interception.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of email content in transit, potential compromise of SMTP credentials allowing unauthorized email sending.
*   **Affected Component:**  Configuration settings used when initializing the `Mail::SMTP` delivery method.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always** use TLS/SSL for SMTP connections when configuring `Mail::SMTP`.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for SMTP.
    *   Securely store SMTP credentials.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in the `mail` Gem](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_the__mail__gem.md)

*   **Description:** The `mail` gem itself contains security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Impact:**  Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:**  The `mail` gem library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `mail` gem to the latest version.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the `mail` gem.
