        * **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious content into email headers, particularly custom headers that the application might process. This can include CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences for header injection or malicious scripts/code.
        * **Technical Details:**  CRLF injection can allow attackers to add arbitrary headers, potentially manipulating email routing or injecting malicious scripts if the headers are displayed in a web interface.
        * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Email Spoofing, Information Disclosure.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Header Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize all header values before processing or displaying them. Remove or encode potentially harmful characters like CRLF.
            * **Avoid Custom Header Processing:** Minimize the processing of custom headers unless absolutely necessary. If required, implement rigorous validation.
            * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

    * **Exploit Content-Type Handling Issues:**
        * **Description:** Attackers can send emails with misleading or incorrect `Content-Type` headers to bypass security checks or trigger incorrect content interpretation by the application.
        * **Technical Details:**  For example, an attacker might send an HTML file with a `Content-Type: text/plain` header to bypass HTML sanitization.
        * **Impact:** XSS, Information Disclosure, Bypass of Security Controls.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Content Sniffing Prevention:**  Configure the application to strictly adhere to the declared `Content-Type` and avoid relying on content sniffing.
            * **Content Validation:**  Validate the actual content of the email against the declared `Content-Type`.
            * **Secure Decoding:**  Use appropriate decoding mechanisms based on the `Content-Type`.

#### 4.2 Exploit Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

Handling email attachments introduces significant security risks, as malicious files can be easily disguised and delivered.

* **Attack Vectors:**

    * **Send email with malicious attachments (e.g., malware, exploits):**
        * **Description:**  Attackers attach executable files, documents with malicious macros, or other forms of malware to emails, hoping the application or its users will execute them.
        * **Technical Details:**  This is a common attack vector, relying on social engineering or vulnerabilities in software used to open the attachments.
        * **Impact:** Malware infection, RCE, Data Breach.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Antivirus Scanning:** Integrate with antivirus engines to scan all incoming attachments for malware.
            * **Sandboxing:**  Process attachments in a sandboxed environment to analyze their behavior before allowing access.
            * **Attachment Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  Implement policies to allow or block specific file types.
            * **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening attachments from unknown senders.

    * **Craft attachments with filenames containing special characters leading to path traversal:**
        * **Description:** Attackers craft filenames with special characters (e.g., `../`, `C:\`) to manipulate the file saving path on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious files in accessible locations.
        * **Technical Details:**  This exploits vulnerabilities in how the application handles and sanitizes filenames when saving attachments.
        * **Impact:** RCE, Data Breach, DoS.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Filename Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize attachment filenames, removing or encoding potentially dangerous characters.
            * **Secure File Storage:**  Store attachments in a secure location with restricted access and prevent direct access via web URLs.
            * **Path Validation:**  Validate the target path before saving attachments to ensure it's within the intended directory.

    * **Application automatically processes attachments without proper security checks:**
        * **Description:** If the application automatically processes attachments (e.g., extracting data, converting formats) without proper security checks, it can be vulnerable to exploits within those processing mechanisms.
        * **Technical Details:**  This could involve vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, document parsing libraries, or other tools used for automatic processing.
        * **Impact:** RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Deferred Processing:** Avoid automatically processing attachments unless absolutely necessary.
            * **Secure Processing Libraries:** Use well-vetted and up-to-date libraries for attachment processing.
            * **Input Validation:** Validate the format and content of attachments before processing.
            * **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits for attachment processing to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

#### 4.3 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

If the application deserializes email content (e.g., using formats like Ruby's `Marshal` or JSON), it can be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.

* **Attack Vectors:**

    * **Send email with serialized malicious objects in the body or headers:**
        * **Description:** Attackers embed serialized objects containing malicious code within the email content. When the application deserializes this data, the malicious code can be executed.
        * **Technical Details:**  This relies on vulnerabilities in the deserialization process that allow for arbitrary code execution.
        * **Impact:** RCE.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources like email.
            * **Use Safe Deserialization Methods:** If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON with strict schema validation instead of formats like `Marshal`.
            * **Implement Integrity Checks:**  Use cryptographic signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity of serialized data before deserialization.

    * **Application deserializes email content without proper validation:**
        * **Description:**  Lack of validation during deserialization allows malicious objects to be instantiated and their code executed.
        * **Technical Details:**  This occurs when the application blindly trusts the data being deserialized without verifying its structure or content.
        * **Impact:** RCE.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Type Checking:**  Enforce strict type checking during deserialization to ensure only expected object types are instantiated.
            * **Whitelist Allowed Classes:**  If using deserialization, explicitly whitelist the classes that are allowed to be deserialized.

    * **Exploit known vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries used by the application:**
        * **Description:**  Deserialization libraries themselves can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
        * **Technical Details:**  Attackers can leverage known exploits for specific versions of deserialization libraries.
        * **Impact:** RCE.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update all deserialization libraries to the latest versions with security patches.
            * **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits of the application's deserialization logic and the libraries used.
