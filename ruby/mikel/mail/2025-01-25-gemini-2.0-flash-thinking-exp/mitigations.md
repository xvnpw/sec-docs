## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation for Email Headers and Body (Directly Related to `mail` Gem Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_for_email_headers_and_body__directly_related_to__mail__gem_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation for Email Headers and Body
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Inputs Used with `mail` Gem:** Pinpoint all locations in your code where user-provided data is used to construct email objects using the `mail` gem. This includes setting properties like `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `from`, custom headers, and the email body content when using `Mail.deliver` or similar methods.
    2.  **Sanitize Before `mail` Gem Processing:**  Before passing user inputs to the `mail` gem to create or send emails, apply sanitization and validation. This step is crucial *before* the `mail` gem processes the data and constructs the email.
    3.  **Header Sanitization:** For headers set via the `mail` gem's API (e.g., `mail.header['X-Custom-Header'] = user_input`), sanitize user input to remove or escape characters like newline characters (`\n`, `\r`), colons (`:`), and carriage returns that can be exploited for header injection. Use allow-lists for permitted characters.
    4.  **Body Sanitization:** When setting the email body using `mail` gem methods like `mail.body = user_input` or when using templates to generate the body content that is then passed to `mail`, sanitize the `user_input` or template output. For HTML emails, ensure proper HTML escaping to prevent script injection.
    5.  **Email Address Validation:** When setting recipient addresses (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `from`) using the `mail` gem, validate email addresses against a strict format to prevent injection through malformed addresses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Email Header Injection (High Severity): Attackers manipulate email headers by injecting malicious content through user input used with the `mail` gem, leading to spam, phishing, or bypassing security filters.
    *   Email Body Injection (Medium Severity): Attackers inject malicious content into the email body through user input used with the `mail` gem, potentially leading to phishing or information disclosure if the email is rendered insecurely.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Email Header Injection: Significantly reduces the risk by preventing attackers from manipulating email headers when using the `mail` gem to send emails.
    *   Email Body Injection: Partially reduces the risk, especially for plain text emails generated and sent via the `mail` gem. For HTML emails, proper HTML escaping in conjunction with `mail` gem usage is crucial.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input validation might be present in some parts of the application before data reaches the email sending logic that uses `mail` gem, but specific sanitization tailored for email headers and body *before* being processed by `mail` gem is likely missing.
    *   *Location:* Form validation in frontend and backend controllers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated sanitization functions specifically for email headers and body applied *immediately before* using the `mail` gem to construct emails.
    *   Unit tests that specifically target email injection vulnerabilities in code sections using the `mail` gem and verify the effectiveness of sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Header Manipulation When Using `mail` Gem (Directly Related to `mail` Gem Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_header_manipulation_when_using__mail__gem__directly_related_to__mail__gem_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Header Manipulation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamically Set Headers via `mail` Gem:** Review your code to find all instances where email headers are dynamically set using the `mail` gem's API based on user input or application logic.
    2.  **Minimize Dynamic Headers:** Reduce the number of headers that are dynamically constructed when using the `mail` gem.  Prefer setting static headers directly in your code or configuration when possible.
    3.  **Hardcode or Configure Static Headers:** For critical headers like `From`, `Return-Path`, and `Sender`, configure them application-wide or within email templates used with the `mail` gem, rather than dynamically setting them based on potentially untrusted user input each time you use `mail` to send an email.
    4.  **Control User-Controlled Headers (If Necessary):** If you must allow user-controlled headers when using the `mail` gem (e.g., `Subject`), strictly limit the allowed headers and apply rigorous input sanitization and validation (as in strategy 1) *before* setting them via the `mail` gem API.
    5.  **Template-Based Emails with `mail` Gem:** Utilize email templates (e.g., using ERB or similar templating engines) in conjunction with the `mail` gem. Define most headers statically within the templates and only dynamically populate the email body content and recipient addresses when using `mail` to send emails based on these templates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Email Header Injection (High Severity): Reduces the attack surface for header injection by limiting the headers that can be manipulated when using the `mail` gem.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Email Header Injection: Significantly reduces the risk by minimizing the attack surface and making header injection attempts more difficult when constructing emails with the `mail` gem.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The `From` address might be configured globally for the application and used when sending emails via `mail` gem, but dynamic header setting might still occur in various parts of the codebase using `mail` gem API without strict control.
    *   *Location:* Application configuration for `From` address.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Code review to identify and minimize all instances of dynamic header construction when using the `mail` gem.
    *   Implementation of template-based email sending using the `mail` gem for common email types to further reduce dynamic header usage with `mail` gem.
    *   Documentation of which headers are dynamically set via `mail` gem and why, along with justification for user control if applicable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update the `mail` Gem (Directly Related to `mail` Gem Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_the__mail__gem__directly_related_to__mail__gem_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update the `mail` Gem

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities *in the `mail` gem* by ensuring you are using the latest, patched version.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management using Bundler is likely in place for projects using the `mail` gem, but a proactive and regular update schedule specifically for the `mail` gem and vulnerability monitoring might be missing.
    *   *Location:* `Gemfile` and Bundler for dependency management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a regular schedule for checking and applying updates specifically to the `mail` gem.
    *   Integrate automated checks for outdated `mail` gem versions into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Document the `mail` gem update process and schedule.
