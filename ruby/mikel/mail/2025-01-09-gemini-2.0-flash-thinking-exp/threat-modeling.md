# Threat Model Analysis for mikel/mail

## Threat: [Malicious Email Parsing Leading to Code Execution](./threats/malicious_email_parsing_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email with malicious content that exploits a vulnerability in the `mail` gem's parsing logic. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server when the application processes the email. The attacker might manipulate MIME boundaries, content types, or encoding to trigger the vulnerability within the gem's parsing mechanisms.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, installation of malware, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Mail::Part`, `Mail::Body`, `Mail::CommonMessage`, potentially core parsing logic within various modules of the `mail` gem.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `mail` gem updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Implement robust error handling and input validation during email parsing, even when using the `mail` gem's parsing capabilities.
* Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing incoming emails, isolating the `mail` gem's execution.
* Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools specifically configured to analyze Ruby code and identify potential parsing vulnerabilities within the `mail` gem.

## Threat: [Exploiting MIME Parsing Vulnerabilities to Deliver Malicious Attachments](./threats/exploiting_mime_parsing_vulnerabilities_to_deliver_malicious_attachments.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an email with a malicious attachment disguised through MIME encoding vulnerabilities in the `mail` gem's parsing. When the application processes the email using the `mail` gem and potentially handles the attachment based on its perceived type as determined by the gem, it could lead to the execution of malicious code on the user's machine or the server.

**Impact:** Client-side or server-side compromise, malware infection, data exfiltration.

**Affected Component:** `Mail::Part`, `Mail::Attachment`, MIME parsing logic within various modules of the `mail` gem.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `mail` gem updated.
* Implement strict security measures for processing and storing attachments received and parsed by the `mail` gem, including virus scanning and sandboxing *after* the gem has processed the email.
* Avoid automatically processing or executing attachment content based solely on the MIME type identified by the `mail` gem.
* Warn users about the risks of opening attachments from unknown senders, regardless of how the `mail` gem has identified them.

## Threat: [Header Injection via Received Email Leading to Spoofing](./threats/header_injection_via_received_email_leading_to_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an email with manipulated headers (e.g., `From`, `Sender`, `Reply-To`) that are not properly sanitized by the application when accessing them through the `mail` gem's header access methods. This can lead to the application constructing subsequent outgoing emails with spoofed origins if it relies on these unsanitized values.

**Impact:** Damage to reputation, phishing attacks against other users, bypassing spam filters.

**Affected Component:** `Mail::Header`, specifically methods for accessing and manipulating header values after parsing within the `mail` gem.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly sanitize and validate all email headers received from external sources *after* they have been parsed by the `mail` gem, before using them in any application logic or when constructing new emails.
* Avoid directly copying header values obtained through the `mail` gem's methods from received emails to outgoing emails without validation.
* Use the `mail` gem's built-in methods for setting headers securely when creating new emails, avoiding direct string concatenation based on potentially malicious input processed by the gem.

## Threat: [Header Injection via Application Logic Leading to Spoofing](./threats/header_injection_via_application_logic_leading_to_spoofing.md)

**Description:** The application uses user-provided data or other dynamic information to construct email headers when using the `mail` gem's methods for setting headers. If this data is not properly sanitized *before* being passed to the `mail` gem's header setting functions, an attacker could manipulate this data to inject arbitrary headers (e.g., `Bcc`, `Cc`, additional `From` headers) into outgoing emails.

**Impact:** Spoofing of outgoing emails, sending spam or phishing emails, information leakage (by adding unintended recipients).

**Affected Component:** `Mail::Header`, specifically methods for setting header values programmatically within the `mail` gem.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data *before* using it to construct email headers via the `mail` gem's API.
* Use the `mail` gem's provided methods for setting headers, which may offer some level of protection against basic injection, but rely on proper input sanitization.
* Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into header values when using the `mail` gem's header manipulation features.

## Threat: [Body Manipulation via Application Logic Leading to Phishing](./threats/body_manipulation_via_application_logic_leading_to_phishing.md)

**Description:** The application dynamically generates email bodies based on user input or other data and uses the `mail` gem's methods to set the body content. If this data is not properly encoded or escaped *before* being passed to the `mail` gem, an attacker could manipulate this data to inject malicious links, scripts, or misleading content into the email body.

**Impact:** Compromised user credentials, malware infection, financial loss for recipients.

**Affected Component:** `Mail::Body`, specifically methods for setting the email body content within the `mail` gem.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Properly encode and escape all dynamic content *before* including it in email bodies using the `mail` gem's API.
* Use templating engines with built-in security features to generate email content that is then passed to the `mail` gem.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for HTML emails where applicable, even when the email is constructed using the `mail` gem.

## Threat: [Using Deprecated or Vulnerable Versions of the `mail` Gem](./threats/using_deprecated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_the__mail__gem.md)

**Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the `mail` gem that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities directly if they are aware of them, potentially through crafted emails or by exploiting weaknesses in the gem's API.

**Impact:** Various, depending on the specific vulnerability. Could lead to code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service directly through the `mail` gem.

**Affected Component:** The entire `mail` gem codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `mail` gem to the latest stable version.
* Monitor security advisories and changelogs for the `mail` gem.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify outdated and vulnerable dependencies, specifically targeting the `mail` gem.
