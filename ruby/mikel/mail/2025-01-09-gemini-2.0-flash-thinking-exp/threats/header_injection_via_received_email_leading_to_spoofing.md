## Deep Analysis: Header Injection via Received Email Leading to Spoofing

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Header Injection via Received Email Leading to Spoofing" threat within the context of an application using the `mail` gem (https://github.com/mikel/mail).

**1. Deeper Dive into the Technical Aspects:**

* **How the `mail` Gem Parses Headers:** The `mail` gem is designed to parse RFC 5322 compliant email messages. When it receives an email (either from a string or an IO stream), it meticulously breaks down the raw email content into its constituent parts, including the headers. The `Mail::Header` class is responsible for storing and providing access to these parsed headers.

* **Mechanism of Header Injection:** Attackers exploit the fact that email headers are essentially key-value pairs separated by a colon and a newline. By injecting carefully crafted newline characters (`\r\n` or just `\n` depending on the mail transfer agent) into header values, they can introduce new, arbitrary headers into the email.

* **Accessing Headers with the `mail` Gem:** The `mail` gem provides various methods to access header values, such as:
    * `mail.header['From'].value`: Returns the value of the `From` header.
    * `mail['From'].value`:  Shorthand for the above.
    * `mail.from`:  Provides a more convenient access for common headers.
    * `mail.header.fields`: Returns an array of `Mail::Field` objects.
    * `mail.header.raw_source`: Returns the raw header string.

    The vulnerability lies in the fact that these methods, by default, return the header values *as parsed by the gem*, without further sanitization. If an attacker has injected malicious newlines and headers, these methods will faithfully return the manipulated data.

* **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1. **Attacker crafts a malicious email:** The attacker constructs an email with injected headers within legitimate header values. For example, within the `From` field:
       ```
       From: legitimate@example.com\r\nReply-To: attacker@evil.com
       ```
    2. **Application receives and parses the email:** The application uses the `mail` gem to parse this incoming email.
    3. **Application accesses the "From" header:** When the application accesses the `From` header using `mail.from` or `mail['From'].value`, the `mail` gem correctly parses the injected `Reply-To` header as a separate header field.
    4. **Vulnerable Logic:** The application, without proper sanitization, might then use the value of `mail.from` to populate the `From` header of a new outgoing email. This will result in the outgoing email appearing to originate from `legitimate@example.com`.
    5. **More insidious scenarios:**  Attackers can inject other headers like `Sender`, `Return-Path`, or even custom headers that the application might unknowingly process and act upon.

**2. Detailed Attack Scenarios and Examples:**

* **Simple `From` Spoofing:** As described above, injecting a `Reply-To` header within the `From` field can lead to spoofing the sender address in subsequent outgoing emails.

* **Redirecting Replies:** Injecting a `Reply-To` header can force replies to the original email to be sent to an attacker-controlled address, even if the application correctly displays the legitimate sender.

* **Bypassing SPF/DKIM/DMARC:** While not directly a vulnerability in the `mail` gem, header injection can be a component of attacks aimed at bypassing email authentication mechanisms. For instance, if an application relies on the `From` header of a received email to verify its authenticity and an attacker has spoofed it, the verification might be bypassed.

* **Injecting Malicious Content:** In some cases, applications might process custom headers. An attacker could inject a custom header with malicious data that the application interprets and acts upon, leading to further vulnerabilities.

* **Information Disclosure:**  Injected headers could potentially reveal internal information about the attacker's infrastructure or techniques if the application logs or processes these headers without careful consideration.

**Example Code (Vulnerable):**

```ruby
require 'mail'

raw_email = "From: legitimate@example.com\r\nReply-To: attacker@evil.com\r\nSubject: Important Message\r\n\r\nBody of the email."
mail = Mail.read_from_string(raw_email)

# Vulnerable code: Directly using the parsed 'From' header
outgoing_email = Mail.new do
  from mail.from
  to 'recipient@example.com'
  subject 'Re: Important Message'
  body 'Your reply...'
end

puts outgoing_email.to_s
```

In this example, the `outgoing_email` will have the `From` header set to `legitimate@example.com`, effectively spoofing the sender.

**3. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the **lack of trust and proper sanitization of external input**. The `mail` gem is designed to parse email headers according to standards, but it doesn't inherently know which header values are safe for the application's specific use case.

The responsibility for security falls on the **application developer** to:

* **Recognize the potential for malicious input:**  Understand that email headers from external sources are untrusted.
* **Implement robust sanitization and validation:**  Cleanse header values before using them in any sensitive operations, especially when constructing new emails.
* **Avoid direct copying of header values:**  Don't blindly transfer header values from received emails to outgoing emails without scrutiny.

**4. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

* **Reputation Damage:**  If the application is used to send spoofed emails, the organization's email domain can be blacklisted, leading to deliverability issues for legitimate emails. This damages the organization's reputation and can impact business operations.

* **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to send convincing phishing emails to other users, potentially stealing credentials or sensitive information. The perceived legitimacy of the sender increases the likelihood of success.

* **Bypassing Security Controls:** Spoofed emails can bypass spam filters and other email security measures, increasing the risk of malware delivery or other malicious activities.

* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the industry and jurisdiction, sending spoofed emails can have legal ramifications and violate compliance regulations.

* **Loss of Customer Trust:** If users receive spoofed emails seemingly originating from the application or organization, it can erode trust in the service.

* **Resource Consumption:**  Responding to complaints and mitigating the damage caused by spoofed emails can consume significant resources.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies (with Code Examples):**

* **Thorough Sanitization and Validation:**

   ```ruby
   require 'mail'

   raw_email = "From: legitimate@example.com\r\nReply-To: attacker@evil.com\r\nSubject: Important Message\r\n\r\nBody of the email."
   mail = Mail.read_from_string(raw_email)

   # Secure code: Sanitizing the 'From' header
   sanitized_from = mail.from.first.gsub(/[\r\n]+/, '') # Remove newlines
   if sanitized_from =~ /\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/ # Basic email validation
     outgoing_email = Mail.new do
       from sanitized_from
       to 'recipient@example.com'
       subject 'Re: Important Message'
       body 'Your reply...'
     end
     puts outgoing_email.to_s
   else
     # Handle invalid 'From' address appropriately (log error, etc.)
     puts "Invalid 'From' address received."
   end
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   * **`gsub(/[\r\n]+/, '')`:**  Removes any newline characters (`\r` or `\n`) from the `From` header value.
   * **`/\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/`:** A basic regular expression for email validation. More robust validation might be needed depending on the application's requirements.
   * **Error Handling:**  It's crucial to handle cases where the sanitized header is invalid.

* **Avoid Directly Copying Headers:** Instead of directly copying header values, explicitly set the required headers in the outgoing email using trusted sources or validated values.

   ```ruby
   require 'mail'

   raw_email = "From: legitimate@example.com\r\nReply-To: attacker@evil.com\r\nSubject: Important Message\r\n\r\nBody of the email."
   mail = Mail.read_from_string(raw_email)

   # Secure code: Explicitly setting the 'From' header
   outgoing_email = Mail.new do
     from 'application@yourdomain.com' # Use a trusted sender address
     to 'recipient@example.com'
     subject "Regarding: #{mail.subject}" # Sanitize the subject if used
     body 'Your reply...'
     reply_to mail.reply_to if mail.reply_to # Only use if validated
   end

   puts outgoing_email.to_s
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   * The `from` header is set to a known and trusted address.
   * The `reply_to` header is only included if it exists in the received email and is considered safe or has been validated.

* **Use the `mail` Gem's Built-in Methods for Setting Headers Securely:** The `mail` gem provides methods like `from=`, `to=`, `subject=`, etc., which handle the proper formatting and encoding of headers. Avoid manual string concatenation.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only access and use the header information that is absolutely necessary for the application's functionality. Avoid processing or logging entire raw headers if not required.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Email (Emerging):** While not directly related to the `mail` gem, consider emerging standards and techniques for email security, such as Content Security Policy for Email, which can help mitigate certain types of email-based attacks.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging of email processing, including received headers (before and after sanitization) and sent emails. This can help in identifying potential attacks and their impact.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor outgoing email patterns for unusual sender addresses or high volumes of emails originating from unexpected sources.
* **User Feedback:** Encourage users to report suspicious emails that appear to originate from the application.
* **Email Authentication Monitoring (SPF/DKIM/DMARC):** Monitor reports from email providers regarding authentication failures for your domain. This can indicate if your domain is being spoofed.
* **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the application's code and configuration to ensure that email header handling is secure.

**7. Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the risks of header injection and the importance of input validation and output encoding.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities in email header handling.
* **Penetration Testing:** Regularly perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the application's security.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep the `mail` gem and other dependencies up to date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the risks of phishing and spoofed emails.

**Conclusion:**

Header injection via received email leading to spoofing is a significant threat that can have severe consequences for applications using the `mail` gem. While the `mail` gem itself is a powerful tool for email processing, it's crucial for developers to understand the inherent risks of trusting unsanitized input from external sources. By implementing robust sanitization, validation, and secure coding practices, along with proactive monitoring and detection mechanisms, development teams can effectively mitigate this threat and protect their applications and users. This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential impact, and the necessary steps to build secure email handling capabilities.
