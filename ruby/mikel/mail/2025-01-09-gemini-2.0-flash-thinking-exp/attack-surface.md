# Attack Surface Analysis for mikel/mail

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject arbitrary email headers by manipulating input that is used to construct email headers.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem provides methods for programmatically setting email headers. If the application uses user-provided data without proper sanitization when setting these headers, it opens the door for injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide input like `"; Bcc: attacker@example.com"` when the application sets a custom header, leading to the email being secretly copied to the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Spam distribution, phishing attacks, bypassing security measures, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided input before using it to set email headers. Specifically, prevent newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and colons (`:`) in header values unless they are intended as part of the header value itself.
        *   **Use Dedicated Methods:** When possible, use the `mail` gem's provided methods for setting standard headers (e.g., `to`, `cc`, `bcc`) instead of directly manipulating the `header` object with unsanitized input.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers:** Minimize the use of user-controlled input for setting custom headers. If necessary, strictly validate the input against a whitelist of allowed characters and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious attachments are processed or handled insecurely by the application in conjunction with the `mail` gem.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem provides access to email attachments, including their content, filenames, and MIME types. The application's subsequent handling of this information can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** If the application saves attachments based on user-provided filenames without proper sanitization, an attacker could use a path traversal filename (e.g., `../../../../evil.exe`) to overwrite arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Malware delivery, arbitrary file write/overwrite, potential for remote code execution if overwritten files are executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize Attachment Filenames:**  Always sanitize attachment filenames before saving them to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Virus Scanning:** Implement virus scanning on all received attachments before allowing users or the application to access them.
        *   **Restrict Attachment Types:** If possible, restrict the types of attachments that are allowed or processed by the application.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded attachments in a secure location with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Avoid Direct Execution:**  Do not directly execute attachments based on user input or without thorough security checks.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Configuration and Credentials Exposure](./attack_surfaces/smtp_configuration_and_credentials_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecurely stored or managed SMTP credentials used by the `mail` gem lead to unauthorized email sending.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem requires SMTP server details and credentials to send emails. If these are compromised, attackers can use the application's email functionality for malicious purposes.
    *   **Example:** SMTP credentials stored in plain text in configuration files or environment variables could be exposed if the application server is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized email sending (spam, phishing), reputational damage, potential for further attacks using the compromised email account.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store SMTP credentials securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files. **Never store credentials in plain text in code.**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the application's email sending functionality only the necessary permissions on the SMTP server.
        *   **Regularly Rotate Credentials:**  Periodically rotate SMTP credentials.
        *   **Monitor Outgoing Email:** Monitor outgoing email traffic for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration for SMTP](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration_for_smtp.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of or misconfigured TLS/SSL encryption when the `mail` gem communicates with the SMTP server allows for interception of sensitive data.
    *   **How `mail` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `mail` gem handles the communication with the SMTP server. If not configured to use TLS/SSL, the email content and potentially SMTP credentials can be transmitted in plain text.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network could intercept the communication between the application and the SMTP server and capture email content or SMTP credentials if TLS/SSL is not enforced.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of email content, potential exposure of SMTP credentials, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Configure the `mail` gem to always use TLS/SSL when connecting to the SMTP server. Verify the server's certificate if possible.
        *   **Use Secure Connection Methods:** Utilize the `mail` gem's options to explicitly specify secure connection methods (e.g., `starttls`).
        *   **Review SMTP Configuration:** Regularly review the SMTP configuration to ensure TLS/SSL is enabled and correctly configured.
