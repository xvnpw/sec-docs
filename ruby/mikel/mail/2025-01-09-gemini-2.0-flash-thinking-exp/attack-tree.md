## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Mail Gem](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mail_gem.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success at this level means the attacker has gained unauthorized access, control, or has otherwise negatively impacted the application through vulnerabilities related to its email handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Receive Malicious Email](./attack_tree_paths/receive_malicious_email.md)

This node signifies the initial stage of many attacks. The application's ability to securely receive and process emails is crucial. If this stage is compromised, malicious content can enter the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Email Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_email_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This highlights weaknesses in the `mail` gem's ability to correctly interpret the structure and content of incoming emails. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows attackers to inject malicious payloads or trigger unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities specifically within the parsing of the email body, which can contain HTML, plain text, and other data. Flaws here can lead to the execution of malicious scripts or the misinterpretation of data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Attachment Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_attachment_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This highlights the risks associated with how the `mail` gem and the application handle email attachments. Vulnerabilities here can allow for the delivery and potential execution of malicious files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript in Email Body -> Trigger Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if application renders email content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_in_email_body_-_trigger_cross-site_scripting__xss__if_application_re_a2f22d15.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts an email with malicious HTML or JavaScript embedded in the body. If the application renders this email content in a web browser without proper sanitization, the malicious script can execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, potentially compromising their account or system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Malicious Attachment (Executable, Document with Macro, etc.) -> If application automatically processes attachments, trigger malware execution or data exfiltration.](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_malicious_attachment__executable__document_with_macro__etc___-_if_application_automatically__1e0864cb.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an email with a malicious attachment, such as an executable file, a document containing a malicious macro, or other harmful file types. If the application automatically processes or opens these attachments without proper security measures, the malware can be executed on the server or the user's machine (if downloaded).

**Impact:** Malware execution can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, ransomware attacks, and the establishment of backdoors for future access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Link Handling in Email Body -> Include phishing links or links to malicious websites in the email body. -> Trick users into clicking on malicious links, leading to credential theft or malware download (indirect compromise via user)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_link_handling_in_email_body_-_include_phishing_links_or_links_to_malicious_websites_in_the_e_7ef08dd4.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker embeds malicious links within the email body. These links may appear legitimate but redirect the user to phishing websites designed to steal credentials or to sites that automatically download malware.

**Impact:** Successful phishing attacks can result in the theft of user credentials, allowing attackers to access sensitive accounts and data. Malware downloads can lead to system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Email Content for Malicious Purposes -> Send Phishing Emails -> Trick users into providing sensitive information by impersonating legitimate entities. -> Damage reputation and potentially gain access to user accounts or data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_email_content_for_malicious_purposes_-_send_phishing_emails_-_trick_users_into_providing__0ea5f6d1.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the application's email sending functionality to craft and send emails that impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., the application itself, a trusted partner). These emails are designed to trick recipients into divulging sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or financial details.

**Impact:** Successful phishing attacks launched through the application can severely damage its reputation, erode user trust, and lead to the compromise of user accounts and sensitive data.
