## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Mail Parsing Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_mail_parsing_vulnerabilities__.md)

**Description:** This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities that arise when the `mail` gem parses incoming emails. Attackers can craft malicious emails to exploit these weaknesses.
*   **Criticality Rationale:** Contains multiple high-impact and/or low-effort attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Header Injection]]](./attack_tree_paths/__header_injection__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting how the gem handles email headers. Attackers can inject malicious content or control characters into headers.
*   **Criticality Rationale:** High impact due to the potential to bypass security checks and inject arbitrary headers. Relatively low effort to attempt.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[CRLF Injection]]](./attack_tree_paths/__crlf_injection__.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting Carriage Return Line Feed characters (`\r\n`) to add arbitrary headers. This can bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Unescaped Headers]]](./attack_tree_paths/__unescaped_headers__.md)

*   **Description:** If the gem doesn't properly escape or sanitize header values, an attacker can inject malicious code or control characters.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Oversized Attachment]]](./attack_tree_paths/__oversized_attachment__.md)

*   **Description:** Sending an extremely large attachment to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting server resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Mail Sending/Receiving Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_mail_sendingreceiving_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the `mail` gem sends and receives emails. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in the SMTP protocol or credential handling.
*   **Criticality Rationale:** Contains multiple high-impact and/or low-effort attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[SMTP Injection]]](./attack_tree_paths/__smtp_injection__.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user input to influence the SMTP commands sent by the `mail` gem, an attacker can inject additional SMTP commands.
*   **Criticality Rationale:** High impact, as it allows sending arbitrary emails and potentially bypassing security checks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Credential Theft/Leak]]](./attack_tree_paths/__credential_theftleak__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to SMTP credentials, allowing them to send emails through the application's account.
*   **Criticality Rationale:** High impact, as it provides direct access to the email account. Relatively easy to exploit if credentials are leaked.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Leaked in Logs/Errors]]](./attack_tree_paths/__leaked_in_logserrors__.md)

*   **Description:** SMTP credentials are inadvertently included in log files or error messages.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Used in Config/Code]]](./attack_tree_paths/__used_in_configcode__.md)

*   **Description:** SMTP credentials are hardcoded directly in the application's code or configuration files.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
