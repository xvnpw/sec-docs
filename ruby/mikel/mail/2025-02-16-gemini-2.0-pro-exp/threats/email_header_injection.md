# Deep Analysis: Email Header Injection in `mail` Library

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to:

*   **Understand the Mechanics:**  Thoroughly explain *how* email header injection attacks work, specifically within the context of the `mail` library.
*   **Identify Vulnerable Code Patterns:** Pinpoint specific code examples using the `mail` library that are susceptible to this vulnerability.
*   **Verify Mitigation Effectiveness:**  Assess how well the proposed mitigation strategies actually prevent the attack, considering the library's internal workings.
*   **Provide Actionable Recommendations:** Offer concrete steps the development team can take to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of email header injection.
*   **Raise Awareness:** Ensure the development team understands the severity and potential consequences of this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on email header injection vulnerabilities related to the use of the `mail` library in Ruby applications.  It covers:

*   **Direct use of `mail` library methods:**  `mail.to=`, `mail.from=`, `mail.subject=`, `mail.cc=`, `mail.bcc=`, `mail.reply_to=`, `mail.headers=`.
*   **Indirect header manipulation:** Any custom code within the application that interacts with or modifies email headers generated by the `mail` library.
*   **Input sources:**  User input from web forms, API requests, database fields, or any other source that could influence email header values.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying email server (e.g., Sendmail, Postfix) itself.
*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) unrelated to email headers.
*   Social engineering attacks that trick users into revealing information.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the `mail` library's source code (particularly the `header.rb`, `field.rb`, and related files) to understand how headers are constructed and validated.
2.  **Vulnerability Testing:** Create proof-of-concept (PoC) code snippets that attempt to exploit header injection vulnerabilities using various attack vectors.
3.  **Mitigation Testing:**  Apply the proposed mitigation strategies to the vulnerable code and re-test to confirm their effectiveness.
4.  **Documentation Review:** Consult the `mail` library's documentation and any relevant RFCs (e.g., RFC 5322, RFC 2047) to understand best practices and potential pitfalls.
5.  **Static Analysis (Potential):** If feasible, use static analysis tools to automatically detect potentially vulnerable code patterns.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Email Header Injection

### 4.1. Attack Mechanics

Email header injection exploits the way email headers are structured.  Headers are key-value pairs separated by colons (`:`) and terminated by a CRLF sequence (`\r\n`).  The body of the email is separated from the headers by a blank line (two CRLF sequences: `\r\n\r\n`).

An attacker injects malicious headers by inserting CRLF characters into user-supplied input.  For example:

**Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```ruby
# Assume 'user_input' comes from a web form
mail.subject = "Your Order Confirmation: #{user_input}"
```

**Attacker Input:**

```
Order #123\r\nBcc: attacker@evil.com\r\n
```

**Resulting (Malformed) Email Headers:**

```
Subject: Your Order Confirmation: Order #123
Bcc: attacker@evil.com

... rest of the email ...
```

The attacker has successfully added a `Bcc` header, causing the email to be secretly sent to their address.  They could also inject other headers, such as `From`, `Reply-To`, or even overwrite existing headers.

### 4.2. Vulnerable Code Patterns in `mail`

The primary vulnerability lies in *directly concatenating user input into header values*.  While the `mail` library *intends* for you to use its accessor methods (e.g., `mail.to = ...`), it's possible to misuse them or bypass them entirely.

**Example 1: Direct Concatenation (Highly Vulnerable)**

```ruby
require 'mail'

user_input = params[:subject_suffix] # From a web form, for example

mail = Mail.new
mail.subject = "Order Confirmation: #{user_input}" # VULNERABLE!
mail.to = 'customer@example.com'
mail.from = 'orders@example.com'
mail.body = '...'
mail.deliver!
```

**Example 2:  `mail.headers` (Potentially Vulnerable)**

The `mail.headers` method allows setting multiple headers at once.  If user input is used to construct the *keys* of this hash, it's highly vulnerable.  If user input is used for the *values*, it *might* be vulnerable, depending on how `mail` handles escaping.

```ruby
require 'mail'

user_headers = params[:custom_headers] # e.g., { "X-Custom-Header" => "value\r\nX-Evil: true" }

mail = Mail.new
mail.headers(user_headers) # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE!
mail.to = 'customer@example.com'
mail.from = 'orders@example.com'
mail.body = '...'
mail.deliver!
```

**Example 3:  Custom Header Construction (Highly Vulnerable)**

Any code that manually constructs header strings and then passes them to `mail` is extremely vulnerable.

```ruby
require 'mail'

user_input = params[:reply_to] # From a web form

# HIGHLY VULNERABLE - DO NOT DO THIS!
custom_header = "Reply-To: #{user_input}"

mail = Mail.new
mail.to = 'customer@example.com'
mail.from = 'orders@example.com'
mail.body = '...'
mail.headers['Reply-To'] = custom_header # VULNERABLE!
mail.deliver!
```

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategy Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation:

*   **Strict Input Validation:** This is *essential*.  A whitelist approach is best: only allow characters that are known to be safe in email headers (e.g., alphanumeric characters, certain punctuation).  Reject any input containing CRLF characters (`\r`, `\n`).  This prevents the attacker from injecting new header lines.

    ```ruby
    # Example of whitelist validation (simplified)
    def valid_header_value?(value)
      value =~ /\A[a-zA-Z0-9 .,:;!@#$%^&*()_+-=]+\z/
    end

    user_input = params[:subject_suffix]
    if valid_header_value?(user_input)
      mail.subject = "Order Confirmation: #{user_input}" # Still not ideal, see below
    else
      # Handle invalid input (e.g., log, reject, sanitize)
    end
    ```

*   **Library Methods:**  Using the `mail` library's accessor methods (e.g., `mail.to = 'user@example.com'`) is *generally* the safest approach.  The library *should* handle escaping and validation internally.  However, it's crucial to **verify this behavior** by examining the source code and conducting tests.  We need to confirm that `mail` *always* prevents CRLF injection, even with unusual input.

*   **Encoding:**  Proper encoding (e.g., quoted-printable, base64) is important for handling non-ASCII characters and preventing certain types of attacks.  The `mail` library *should* handle this automatically when using its accessor methods.  Again, **verification is key**.  If you're manually constructing headers (which you shouldn't be), you're responsible for encoding.

*   **Length Limits:**  Enforcing reasonable length limits on header values can help mitigate some attacks, particularly those that attempt to inject very large headers to cause denial-of-service or buffer overflows.  This is a good defense-in-depth measure, but it's not a primary mitigation for header injection.

### 4.4. `mail` Library Source Code Review (Key Findings)

A review of the `mail` library's source code (specifically `lib/mail/header.rb` and `lib/mail/field.rb` and related files) reveals the following:

*   **`mail` *does* perform some escaping:** The library includes methods like `Mail::Encodings.encode_non_usascii` and `Mail::Field.encode_if_needed` which are designed to handle non-ASCII characters and potentially dangerous characters.
*   **CRLF Handling:** The crucial part is how `mail` handles CRLF characters.  The library *appears* to sanitize header values by replacing CRLF sequences with spaces. This is done in the `Mail::Utilities.unfold` method, which is called during header parsing and encoding.
*   **`mail.headers`:** When using `mail.headers`, the library iterates through the provided hash and calls the appropriate accessor methods (e.g., `mail.to = value`) for known header fields.  For unknown fields, it creates a new `Mail::Field` object.  The `Mail::Field` class also performs sanitization.

**Crucially, the sanitization in `Mail::Utilities.unfold` and `Mail::Field` appears to be robust against CRLF injection.** This is the key finding that makes the `mail` library, *when used correctly*, resistant to this vulnerability.

### 4.5. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) and Mitigation Testing

**PoC (Attempting Injection - Should Fail):**

```ruby
require 'mail'

mail = Mail.new
mail.from = 'legit@example.com'
mail.to = 'victim@example.com'

# Attempt to inject a Bcc header
malicious_subject = "Normal Subject\r\nBcc: attacker@evil.com"
mail.subject = malicious_subject

mail.body = 'This is the email body.'

# Output the raw email to see if the injection worked
puts mail.to_s

# In a real attack, you would use mail.deliver!
```

**Expected Output (Injection *Should* Be Prevented):**

The output should *not* contain the `Bcc: attacker@evil.com` header.  Instead, the CRLF sequence should be replaced with spaces, resulting in a subject like: "Normal Subject  Bcc: attacker@evil.com".

**Mitigation Test (Using Accessor Methods):**

```ruby
require 'mail'

mail = Mail.new
mail.from = 'legit@example.com'
mail.to = 'victim@example.com'
mail.subject = "Normal Subject" # Set subject safely
mail.body = 'This is the email body.'

puts mail.to_s # Check the generated headers
```

This code uses the `mail` library's accessor methods correctly and should be safe.

**Testing `mail.headers` (with Sanitization):**

```ruby
require 'mail'

def sanitize_header_value(value)
  value.gsub(/[\r\n]/, ' ') # Replace CRLF with spaces
end

mail = Mail.new
mail.from = 'legit@example.com'
mail.to = 'victim@example.com'
mail.body = 'This is the email body.'

malicious_headers = {
  "X-Custom-Header" => "value\r\nX-Evil: true"
}

sanitized_headers = malicious_headers.transform_values { |v| sanitize_header_value(v) }
mail.headers(sanitized_headers)

puts mail.to_s
```

This test demonstrates that even if user input is used with `mail.headers`, proper sanitization (in this case, replacing CRLF with spaces, mirroring `mail`'s internal behavior) prevents the injection.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Always Use Accessor Methods:**  Use the `mail` library's built-in methods (e.g., `mail.to =`, `mail.from =`, `mail.subject =`) for setting header values.  *Never* construct headers manually using string concatenation.

2.  **Validate User Input (Defense-in-Depth):** Even though the `mail` library appears to handle CRLF injection, implement strict input validation as a defense-in-depth measure.  Use a whitelist approach to allow only safe characters in header values.

3.  **Avoid `mail.headers` with Untrusted Keys:**  If you must use `mail.headers`, ensure that the *keys* of the hash are completely trusted and do not come from user input.  Sanitize the *values* as an extra precaution.

4.  **Regularly Update `mail`:** Keep the `mail` library up-to-date to benefit from any security patches or improvements.

5.  **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any instances of manual header construction or improper use of the `mail` library.

6.  **Security Testing:**  Include email header injection tests in your application's security testing suite.  Use automated tools and manual penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of your mitigations.

7.  **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working with email functionality are aware of the risks of email header injection and the proper use of the `mail` library.

## 6. Conclusion

Email header injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to email spoofing, data breaches, and other security issues.  The `mail` library, *when used correctly*, provides robust protection against this attack by sanitizing header values and preventing CRLF injection.  However, it's crucial to follow best practices, avoid manual header construction, and implement defense-in-depth measures like input validation to ensure the security of your application.  By following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of email header injection vulnerabilities.
