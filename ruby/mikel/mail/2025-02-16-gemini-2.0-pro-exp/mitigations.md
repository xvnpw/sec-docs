# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mikel/mail

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Sending)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__sending_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Sending)

**Description:**
1.  **Recipient Validation:** Before passing *any* recipient address to `mail`, use a robust email validation library (e.g., `email_validator` in Python) to ensure the address conforms to RFC specifications. Reject invalid addresses.
2.  **Subject Sanitization:** Limit the subject length.  Remove or encode control characters (especially `\r` and `\n`) that could be used for header injection.  Escape any other special characters that might have meaning in email headers.
3.  **Body Sanitization:**
    *   **Plain Text:** If the body is plain text, escape any characters that could be misinterpreted as email header syntax or MIME encoding directives.
    *   **HTML:** If the body is HTML, use a *strict* HTML sanitizer (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, `bleach` in Python).  Allow only a very limited set of safe HTML tags and attributes.  *Never* trust user-provided HTML directly.  Use a whitelist-based approach.
4.  **Attachment Handling (Filename and Content):**
    *   **Filename Validation:** Before passing filenames to `mail`, validate them.  Check for dangerous characters, double extensions (e.g., `file.pdf.exe`), and excessively long names.  Sanitize or reject suspicious filenames.
    *   **Content Type (MIME Type) Validation:**  Use the `mail` library's features (or a separate MIME type detection library) to determine the *declared* MIME type of the attachment.  Compare this against a whitelist of allowed MIME types.  *Do not* rely solely on the file extension.  Ideally, this would be combined with magic byte detection (which is less directly related to `mail` itself, but crucial).
5. **Encoding:** Ensure that `mail` is configured to use the correct character encoding (UTF-8 for text) and appropriate encoding for attachments (usually Base64). This is usually handled by the library, but verify the settings.
6. **Header Control:** Be extremely careful when setting *any* custom headers using `mail`.  Validate and sanitize any user-supplied data used in custom headers.  Prefer using the library's built-in methods for setting standard headers (e.g., `Subject`, `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`) rather than manually constructing headers.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Header Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious email headers.
*   **Content Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious content into the email body.
*   **Attachment-Based Attacks (Severity: High):** Reduces (but doesn't eliminate) the risk of sending malicious attachments.  (Requires external validation like magic bytes and anti-malware).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents XSS in HTML emails.
*   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** (Indirectly) mitigates if email content is ever (incorrectly) used to build commands.

**Impact:**
*   **Header Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Content Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Attachment-Based Attacks:** Risk reduced (but further mitigation is essential).
*   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (with robust HTML sanitization).
*   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced (but this scenario should be avoided).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Recipient validation using `email_validator`.
*   Basic subject sanitization (length limit).
*   HTML sanitization using `bleach` (limited templates).
*   File extension whitelist (but not MIME type or magic byte).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive validation for all email sending functions.
*   MIME type validation using `mail`'s features or a dedicated library.
*   Consistent encoding enforcement.
*   Strict control and validation of custom headers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure MIME Parsing and Handling (Receiving)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mime_parsing_and_handling__receiving_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure MIME Parsing and Handling (Receiving)

**Description:**
1.  **Robust Parser:** Ensure `mail` is using a secure and up-to-date MIME parser.  Vulnerabilities in MIME parsing have been exploited in the past.  Keep the library updated.
2.  **Limit MIME Depth:**  Set a reasonable limit on the maximum depth of MIME nesting that your application will process using `mail`.  Deeply nested MIME structures can be used for denial-of-service or to exploit parser vulnerabilities.  The `mail` library might have options to configure this.
3.  **Content-Type Validation:**  When processing MIME parts, carefully validate the `Content-Type` header.  Be suspicious of unusual or unexpected content types.  Compare against a whitelist of expected types if possible.
4.  **Content-Disposition Handling:**  Pay attention to the `Content-Disposition` header (especially for attachments).  Ensure that filenames are properly sanitized before being used (e.g., to save the attachment to disk).  Avoid using user-supplied filenames directly.
5.  **Encoding Handling:**  Ensure that `mail` correctly handles different character encodings and MIME encodings (e.g., Base64, Quoted-Printable).  Incorrect decoding can lead to vulnerabilities or data corruption.
6. **Header Extraction and Validation:** When extracting headers from MIME parts, validate and sanitize them before using them. Be especially cautious with headers that might influence program logic (e.g., `Content-ID`, custom `X-` headers).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **MIME Parsing Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the MIME parser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents DoS attacks that use deeply nested MIME structures.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Prevents issues caused by incorrect handling of encodings.
*   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** (Indirectly) Mitigates injection attacks if header values are misused.
*   **Attachment-Based Attacks (Severity: High):** (Partially) Mitigates by validating `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition`.

**Impact:**
*   **MIME Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced.
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced (if header values are properly handled).
*   **Attachment-Based Attacks:** Risk partially reduced (further mitigation needed).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Using `mail` for MIME parsing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit limit on MIME depth is not set.
*   `Content-Type` validation is basic and needs to be more comprehensive (whitelist).
*   `Content-Disposition` handling is not fully secured (filename sanitization is incomplete).
*   Encoding handling relies on `mail` defaults; needs explicit verification.
*   Header extraction and validation are not consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Header Analysis (Receiving)](./mitigation_strategies/header_analysis__receiving_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Header Analysis (Receiving)

**Description:**
1.  **Parse Headers:** Use `mail` to reliably extract *all* email headers.
2.  **"From", "Reply-To", "Return-Path" Consistency Check:** Within your code that uses `mail`, compare these headers. Discrepancies can indicate spoofing.
3.  **"Received" Header Parsing (Limited):** While full chain analysis is often done at the mail server level, you can use `mail` to *extract* the `Received` headers.  Your application code can then perform *basic* checks, such as:
    *   Checking for the presence of known malicious IP addresses or domains (using a local blacklist or a simple API call).
    *   Checking for an excessive number of `Received` headers (a possible sign of routing manipulation).
4.  **Message-ID Uniqueness Check:** Use `mail` to get the `Message-ID` and check if it's unique (within your system's context).  Duplicate IDs can indicate spam or replay attacks.  This requires maintaining a database of seen Message-IDs.
5.  **X-Header Examination:** Use `mail` to extract custom `X-` headers.  Examine these for any suspicious patterns or information.  Define a set of known/expected `X-` headers and treat others with caution.
6. **Authentication-Results Parsing:** Use `mail` to extract the `Authentication-Results` header. Parse this header to get the results of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. This is *crucial* for detecting spoofing. Your application logic should then act on these results (e.g., reject or flag emails that fail DMARC).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Email Spoofing (Severity: High):** Detects forged sender information.
*   **Phishing (Severity: High):** Helps identify phishing emails.
*   **Spam (Severity: Medium):** Helps identify spam based on header anomalies.
*   **Business Email Compromise (BEC) (Severity: High):** Helps detect BEC attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Email Spoofing:** Risk significantly reduced (especially with `Authentication-Results` parsing).
*   **Phishing:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Spam:** Risk reduced.
*   **BEC:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Header parsing using `mail`.
*   Basic "From" address consistency check.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `Authentication-Results` parsing and handling.
*   "Received" header basic checks (blacklist lookup).
*   Message-ID uniqueness check.
*   Comprehensive X-header examination.
*   "Reply-To" and "Return-Path" consistency checks.
