# Threat Model Analysis for mikel/mail

## Threat: [SMTP Credential Leakage](./threats/smtp_credential_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's SMTP credentials. This could happen through various means:
    *   Hardcoded Credentials: The credentials are found directly in the application's source code (e.g., committed to a public repository).
    *   Insecure Configuration: Credentials are stored in plain text in configuration files that are accessible to unauthorized users or processes.
    *   Environment Variable Exposure: Credentials stored in environment variables are exposed due to misconfiguration or a compromised server.
    *   Logging: Credentials are inadvertently logged to application logs or monitoring systems.
    *   Debugging: Credentials are exposed during debugging sessions.

*   **Impact:** The attacker can send emails using the application's legitimate SMTP server. This allows for:
    *   Spam/Phishing Campaigns: Sending unsolicited emails, potentially damaging the application's reputation and leading to blacklisting.
    *   Malware Distribution: Sending emails containing malicious attachments or links.
    *   Impersonation: Sending emails that appear to originate from the application or its users.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Potentially sending sensitive data via email.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Mail::SMTP` (and related configuration handling within the application).  Specifically, any code that handles the `settings` hash passed to `Mail::SMTP.new` or uses `Mail.defaults`.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Configuration Management: Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Environment Variables (Securely): If using environment variables, ensure they are set securely and only accessible to the application process.
    *   No Hardcoding: Absolutely never hardcode credentials in the source code.
    *   Least Privilege: The SMTP user should have minimal permissions (only send, not manage the server).
    *   Credential Rotation: Regularly rotate SMTP credentials.
    *   Logging Discipline:  *Never* log credentials.  Use redaction if necessary.
    *   OAuth 2.0: If the mail provider supports it, use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, avoiding the need to store passwords.

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into email headers by exploiting insufficient validation of user-supplied input used to construct headers (e.g., `To`, `From`, `Subject`, `CC`, `BCC`, `Reply-To`).  The attacker might:
    *   Provide specially crafted input containing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and header field names.
    *   Exploit vulnerabilities in how the application concatenates strings to form headers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Email Spoofing: Forge the `From` address, making emails appear to come from a trusted source.
    *   BCC Hijacking: Add their own address to the `BCC` field, secretly receiving copies of all emails.
    *   Reply-To Redirection: Redirect replies to a malicious address.
    *   Spam Filter Bypass: Inject headers to evade spam filters.
    *   Information Disclosure: Potentially reveal internal server information through injected headers.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Any `mail` library methods that set headers: `mail.to=`, `mail.from=`, `mail.subject=`, `mail.cc=`, `mail.bcc=`, `mail.reply_to=`, `mail.headers=`.  Also, any custom code that manually constructs header strings.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Input Validation: Validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input used in headers. Use a whitelist approach.
    *   Library Methods:**  Use the `mail` library's built-in methods for setting headers (e.g., `mail.to = 'user@example.com'`).  *Do not* construct headers manually by string concatenation.
    *   Encoding: Ensure proper encoding of header values (e.g., quoted-printable, base64) where necessary, especially for non-ASCII characters.  The library *should* handle this, but verify.
    *   Length Limits: Enforce reasonable length limits on header values.

## Threat: [Email Body Injection (HTML/Plain Text)](./threats/email_body_injection__htmlplain_text_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the email body.  This is similar to XSS in web applications. The attacker might:
    *   Provide input containing HTML tags and JavaScript if the email is sent as HTML.
    *   Inject content that could be misinterpreted by the recipient or downstream systems, even in plain text emails.

*   **Impact:**
    *   HTML Injection (XSS): If the email is HTML, the attacker can inject JavaScript, leading to XSS attacks against recipients using vulnerable email clients.
    *   Plain Text Injection:  Inject content that could be misinterpreted (e.g., commands, URLs).
    *   Phishing: Craft convincing phishing emails to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   Reputation Damage:  Send offensive or inappropriate content.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `mail.body=`, `mail.html_part=`, `mail.text_part=`.  Any code that sets the email body content.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   HTML Sanitization: If sending HTML emails, use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach in Python) to remove dangerous tags and attributes. *Do not rely solely on the `mail` library*.
    *   Plain Text Preference: If HTML is not essential, send emails as plain text only.
    *   Input Validation/Sanitization: Sanitize and encode *all* user-supplied input included in the body, even for plain text emails.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP):  Consider using a CSP header in HTML emails (though email client support is limited).

## Threat: [Malicious Attachments](./threats/malicious_attachments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., malware, virus, exploit document) that is then included as an attachment in an outgoing email.

*   **Impact:** Recipients who open the attachment could be infected with malware.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `mail.add_file`, `mail.attachments`.  Any code that handles file uploads and attachments.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   File Type Validation:  Strictly validate file types using a whitelist (not a blacklist).  Do not rely solely on file extensions.  Use MIME type detection and potentially magic number analysis.
    *   Antivirus Scanning:** Scan all attachments with an up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware solution *before* including them in emails.
    *   File Size Limits:**  Enforce reasonable limits on attachment sizes.
    *   Secure Storage: Store attachments securely, preventing unauthorized access.
    *   Sandboxing: Consider processing attachments in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Renaming: Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal attacks.

## Threat: [IMAP/POP3 Credential Leakage](./threats/imappop3_credential_leakage.md)

*   **Description:**  Identical to SMTP credential leakage, but for credentials used to *receive* emails via IMAP or POP3.

*   **Impact:** The attacker gains full access to the mailbox, allowing them to read, delete, and potentially modify emails.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Mail::IMAP` (and related configuration), `Mail::POP3` (and related configuration).  Any code that handles retrieving emails.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Same as for SMTP credential leakage.

## Threat: [Email Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/email_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `mail` library (or any underlying parsing libraries it uses) contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a specially crafted email. This could lead to buffer overflows, remote code execution, or denial of service.

*   **Impact:** The attacker could gain control of the application or cause it to crash.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The entire `mail` library, particularly the parsing components (e.g., MIME parsing, header parsing, body parsing).  This includes underlying libraries like `treetop` (if used).

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Updated:**  Keep the `mail` library and *all* its dependencies up to date.  Regularly check for security updates.
    *   Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test the email parsing functionality with a variety of malformed email inputs.
    *   Memory Safety:** If possible, use a memory-safe language or memory safety features.
    *   Sandboxing:** Consider running email parsing in a separate, sandboxed process.
    *   Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to the parsing library.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Email Processing](./threats/command_injection_via_email_processing.md)

* **Description:** The application processes emails in a way that involves executing system commands, and unsanitized email content is passed to these commands. An attacker crafts a malicious email containing command injection payloads.
    * **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Any code that uses system calls (e.g., `system()`, `exec()`, backticks) with data derived from email content. This is *not* a direct part of the `mail` library itself, but a potential misuse of it.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid System Calls:**  Avoid using system commands to process email content whenever possible.
        * **Parameterized Commands:** If system commands are unavoidable, use parameterized commands or APIs that prevent injection.
        * **Least Privilege:** Run the email processing component with the least possible privileges.
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Rigorously sanitize any email data used in system commands, even if using parameterized commands.
