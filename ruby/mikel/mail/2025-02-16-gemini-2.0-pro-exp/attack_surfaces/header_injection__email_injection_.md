# Deep Analysis: Header Injection (Email Injection) in `mail` Gem

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Header Injection vulnerability within the context of the `mail` gem, identify specific code patterns that introduce the risk, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the vulnerability effectively.  This goes beyond general advice and delves into the specifics of how the `mail` gem interacts with user input.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the Header Injection vulnerability as it relates to the `mail` gem.  It covers:

*   How the `mail` gem's API can be misused to create vulnerabilities.
*   Specific examples of vulnerable code patterns.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices.
*   The interaction between user-supplied data and the `mail` gem's header-setting methods.
*   The analysis does *not* cover other email-related vulnerabilities (e.g., SMTP command injection, mail server misconfiguration) unless they directly relate to header injection via the `mail` gem.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review `mail` Gem Documentation:** Examine the official documentation and source code of the `mail` gem to understand how headers are handled internally.
2.  **Identify Vulnerable Patterns:** Based on the documentation and common attack patterns, identify specific ways the `mail` gem can be misused to introduce header injection vulnerabilities.
3.  **Construct Exploit Examples:** Create realistic examples of how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Develop Mitigation Strategies:**  For each vulnerable pattern, develop specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Analyze Edge Cases:** Consider less obvious scenarios and edge cases that might bypass initial mitigation attempts.
6.  **Document Findings:**  Present the findings in a clear, concise, and actionable format.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Header Injection

### 2.1. Understanding the `mail` Gem's Header Handling

The `mail` gem provides a convenient interface for creating and sending emails.  Key methods related to headers include:

*   `mail.to =`: Sets the recipient(s).
*   `mail.from =`: Sets the sender.
*   `mail.subject =`: Sets the subject.
*   `mail.bcc =`: Sets blind carbon copy recipients.
*   `mail.cc =`: Sets carbon copy recipients.
*   `mail.reply_to =`: Sets the reply-to address.
*   `mail[:header_name] =`:  Allows setting arbitrary headers.  This is a *high-risk* area if used with unsanitized user input.

Internally, the `mail` gem constructs the email headers as strings.  While the gem *does* perform some encoding, it relies on the developer to provide reasonably safe input.  The core vulnerability lies in the fact that the gem doesn't inherently prevent the injection of newline characters (`\r` and `\n`) into header values.

### 2.2. Vulnerable Code Patterns

Here are specific, vulnerable code patterns using the `mail` gem:

**2.2.1. Direct User Input in `mail.to =` (and similar methods):**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
email = Mail.new
email.to = params[:email]  # Directly using user input
email.subject = "Contact Form Submission"
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

*   **Exploit:**  An attacker submits `user@example.com\r\nBcc: attacker@evil.com`.
*   **Result:** The attacker receives a BCC of the email.

**2.2.2. Direct User Input in `mail[:header_name] =`:**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
email = Mail.new
email.to = "legit@example.com"
email[:Custom-Header] = params[:user_data] # Extremely dangerous
email.subject = "Contact Form Submission"
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

*   **Exploit:** An attacker submits `\r\nFrom: ceo@yourcompany.com\r\nX-Mailer: MaliciousMailer`.
*   **Result:**  The email appears to be from `ceo@yourcompany.com`, and a custom `X-Mailer` header is injected.

**2.2.3. Insufficient Sanitization:**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE (Insufficient)
email = Mail.new
email.to = params[:email].gsub(/[\r\n]/, '') # Only removes \r and \n, not other dangerous chars
email.subject = "Contact Form Submission"
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

*   **Exploit:** An attacker submits `user@example.com%0aBcc: attacker@evil.com` (URL-encoded newline).  The `gsub` doesn't catch this.
*   **Result:** The attacker receives a BCC.  This highlights the need for allow-listing, not just deny-listing.

**2.2.4.  Using `mail.header[]=` with unsanitized data:**
This is a less common but still dangerous pattern. The `header[]=` method allows for direct manipulation of the header fields, and if user input is used here without proper sanitization, it can lead to header injection.

```ruby
#VULNERABLE
email = Mail.new
email.to = "legit@example.com"
email.header['X-Custom-Header'] = params[:user_data] # Dangerous
email.deliver!
```

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**2.3.1.  Strict Input Validation (Allow-Listing):**

*   **Principle:**  Define *exactly* what characters are allowed in each header field.  Reject *everything* else.
*   **Implementation:** Use regular expressions to enforce strict validation.  For email addresses, use a well-tested email validation library (don't roll your own regex).

```ruby
# RECOMMENDED (Allow-Listing)
def valid_email?(email)
  # Use a robust email validation library or a very strict regex
  email =~ /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i
end

def sanitize_header_value(value)
  # Allow only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and a few safe punctuation marks.
  value.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s\-.,:;!?]/, '')
end

email = Mail.new
if valid_email?(params[:email])
  email.to = params[:email]
else
  # Handle invalid email (log, error message, etc.)
  raise "Invalid email address"
end

email.subject = sanitize_header_value(params[:subject]) # Sanitize other headers too
email.body = params[:message] # Body is less critical for header injection, but still sanitize
email.deliver!
```

**2.3.2.  Use `mail` Gem's Methods Correctly:**

*   **Principle:**  *Always* use the dedicated methods (`mail.to =`, `mail.from =`, etc.) for setting standard headers.  Avoid manual header string construction.
*   **Implementation:**  Refactor code to use the appropriate methods.

```ruby
# RECOMMENDED
email = Mail.new
email.to = params[:email] if valid_email?(params[:email]) # Validate first!
email.from = "noreply@yourcompany.com"  # Use a pre-defined, safe address
email.subject = "Contact Form Submission"
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

**2.3.3.  Avoid `mail[:header_name] =` with User Input:**

*   **Principle:**  If you *must* use `mail[:header_name] =`, ensure the value is *completely* under your application's control and *never* derived from user input.
*   **Implementation:**  Use constants or configuration values, *not* user-supplied data.  If you absolutely *must* include user data in a custom header, sanitize it *extremely* thoroughly (allow-listing).

```ruby
# RECOMMENDED (if custom headers are unavoidable)
email = Mail.new
email.to = "legit@example.com"
email[:X-App-Version] = APP_VERSION # Constant, safe
# email[:X-User-ID] = sanitize_header_value(params[:user_id]) # Only if absolutely necessary, and sanitize!
email.deliver!
```

**2.3.4. Explicit Encoding (Supplementary):**

* **Principle:** Even when using the gem's methods, explicitly encoding header values can provide an extra layer of defense.
* **Implementation:** Use `Mail::Encodings.q_value_encode`

```ruby
email = Mail.new
email.to = params[:email] if valid_email?(params[:email])
email.subject = Mail::Encodings.q_value_encode("Contact Form Submission", "UTF-8")
```
While this is good practice, it should *not* be relied upon as the *primary* defense against header injection. Input validation is paramount.

**2.3.5.  Avoid Direct User Input in Sensitive Headers:**

*   **Principle:**  Headers like `From:`, `Reply-To:`, and `Message-ID:` should ideally be set to pre-defined, application-controlled values.
*   **Implementation:**  Hardcode these values or retrieve them from configuration.

```ruby
# RECOMMENDED
email = Mail.new
email.to = params[:email] if valid_email?(params[:email])
email.from = "noreply@yourcompany.com" # Hardcoded
email.reply_to = "support@yourcompany.com" # Hardcoded
email.subject = "Contact Form Submission"
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

**2.3.6.  Sanitize User Input (as a fallback):**

*   **Principle:**  If you cannot use allow-listing (which is strongly preferred), sanitize user input by removing or replacing dangerous characters.
*   **Implementation:**  Use `gsub` with a regular expression that targets characters known to be problematic in email headers (CR, LF, null bytes, etc.).  *However*, this is less secure than allow-listing.

```ruby
# LESS RECOMMENDED (Sanitization as fallback)
def sanitize_header_value_fallback(value)
  value.gsub(/[\r\n\0]/, '') # Remove CR, LF, and null bytes
end

email = Mail.new
email.to = sanitize_header_value_fallback(params[:email]) # Still vulnerable to clever bypasses
email.subject = sanitize_header_value_fallback(params[:subject])
email.body = params[:message]
email.deliver!
```

### 2.4. Edge Cases and Considerations

*   **URL Encoding/Decoding:**  Be aware of how your framework handles URL encoding.  Attackers might try to bypass filters by using URL-encoded characters (`%0a` for newline, `%0d` for carriage return).  Ensure your validation handles decoded values.
*   **Character Encoding Issues:**  Different character encodings can introduce unexpected behavior.  Use UTF-8 consistently and be mindful of how the `mail` gem handles different encodings.
*   **Third-Party Libraries:**  If you use other libraries that interact with the `mail` gem, audit them for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Framework-Specific Behavior:**  Different Ruby web frameworks (Rails, Sinatra, etc.) might have their own ways of handling parameters and input.  Understand how your framework interacts with user input.
*  **Obfuscation:** Attackers may use various techniques to obfuscate malicious input, such as using different character encodings, or inserting unusual whitespace characters.

### 2.5.  Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify that your validation and sanitization logic correctly handles various malicious inputs, including:
    *   CR and LF characters (`\r`, `\n`).
    *   URL-encoded CR and LF (`%0d`, `%0a`).
    *   Null bytes (`\0`).
    *   Long strings.
    *   Non-ASCII characters.
    *   Empty strings.
    *   Strings with only whitespace.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire email sending flow to ensure that header injection is not possible in a real-world scenario.
*   **Security Testing (Penetration Testing):**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

Header injection in the `mail` gem is a critical vulnerability that can lead to severe consequences.  The primary mitigation strategy is **strict input validation using allow-listing**.  Always use the gem's dedicated methods for setting headers, and avoid direct manipulation of header strings with user input.  By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of header injection attacks and protect their applications and users.  Regular security testing and code reviews are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
