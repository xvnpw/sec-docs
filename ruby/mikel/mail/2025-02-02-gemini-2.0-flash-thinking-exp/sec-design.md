# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the `mail` Ruby library, aims to simplify email handling for Ruby developers. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for parsing, generating, and sending emails within Ruby applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Primary goal: Provide a robust and easy-to-use Ruby library for email processing.
  - Enable Ruby developers to efficiently integrate email functionality into their applications.
  - Maintain compatibility with email standards and protocols.
  - Ensure the library is reliable and performant for handling email operations.
  - Foster a community around the library for contributions and improvements.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to email injection attacks, data breaches, or denial of service.
  - Compatibility issues with evolving email standards or Ruby versions could reduce adoption and utility.
  - Performance bottlenecks in email processing could negatively impact application performance.
  - Lack of community support or maintenance could lead to stagnation and security risks over time.
  - Incorrect handling of email content could lead to data loss or corruption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (Implicit in open-source development).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions (Present in the repository).
  - security control: Dependency management using Bundler to manage and track external libraries (Standard Ruby practice).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities introduced through contributed code.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in used dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Consider adding fuzz testing to discover unexpected input handling issues.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The library itself does not handle authentication as it's a client-side library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using the library when connecting to SMTP servers or email services.
    - Requirement: If the library provides any helper functions for authentication (e.g., for SMTP), these must securely handle credentials and connection establishment.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The library does not handle authorization. Authorization is managed by the application using the library and the email services it interacts with.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all email components (headers, body, attachments) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., email header injection, command injection via email content).
    - Requirement: Input validation should handle various email encoding formats and character sets correctly to avoid bypasses.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The library should support secure email protocols like TLS/SSL for SMTP connections to protect email transmission in transit.
    - Requirement: If the library handles email encryption or signing (e.g., S/MIME, PGP), it must use established and secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and certificates if encryption or signing features are implemented.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the `mail` library itself, the critical process is providing a secure and reliable library for email handling. Failure in this process can impact all applications that depend on it.
  - For applications using the `mail` library, critical business processes could include:
    - Sending transactional emails (e.g., password resets, order confirmations).
    - Receiving and processing customer inquiries via email.
    - Email marketing campaigns.
    - System monitoring and alerting via email.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data handled by the `mail` library includes:
    - Email content (headers, body, attachments): Sensitivity depends on the application using the library. Could range from low (system notifications) to high (personal or confidential information in emails).
    - Email metadata (sender, recipient, timestamps): Can be sensitive depending on context and regulations (e.g., GDPR).
    - Credentials for SMTP servers or email services: Highly sensitive, must be protected to prevent unauthorized email sending.
  - Sensitivity levels:
    - Low: Publicly available information in emails.
    - Medium: Non-public, non-critical business information in emails.
    - High: Personally identifiable information (PII), confidential business data, financial information, or protected health information (PHI) in emails.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of security features for the `mail` library itself? Should it actively prevent common email vulnerabilities, or primarily provide tools for applications to do so?
  - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that applications using this library might need to adhere to when handling email data?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the `mail` library?
  - Are there any existing security scanning or testing practices in place for the `mail` library project beyond standard testing?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source library for the Ruby community. Security is a significant concern for the library's users.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are primarily based on standard open-source development practices (code review, testing). There's room for improvement in automated security testing and vulnerability management.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed to be a client-side library used within Ruby applications. It focuses on email parsing, generation, and basic sending functionalities, leaving higher-level security concerns (like authentication and authorization) to the application using it. The build process is assumed to be using standard Ruby gem packaging and publishing practices, potentially leveraging GitHub Actions for CI.
