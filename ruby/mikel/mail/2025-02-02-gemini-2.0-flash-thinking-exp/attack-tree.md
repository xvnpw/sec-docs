## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Email Parsing Vulnerabilities (Incoming Emails) - HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_email_parsing_vulnerabilities__incoming_emails__-_high_risk_path.md)

* **General Description:**  This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the application's processing of incoming emails, specifically the body and attachments.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize and validate email content, attackers can inject malicious payloads.

    * **1.2. Body Parsing Exploits - HIGH RISK PATH**
        * **General Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application parses and processes the email body. HTML emails are particularly risky.

            * **1.2.1. HTML Email Exploits (If application renders HTML emails) - HIGH RISK PATH**
                * **General Description:** If the application renders HTML emails, attackers can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript.
