### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Header Injection Vulnerabilities (Email Sending)

#### 4.1. Understanding Header Injection

Header injection vulnerabilities arise from the fundamental structure of email messages. Emails are composed of two main parts:

*   **Headers:**  Metadata about the email, such as sender (`From`), recipient (`To`), subject (`Subject`), date, and various control headers (e.g., `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Content-Type`). Headers are structured as `Header-Name: Header-Value` pairs, each on a new line, and are separated from the email body by a blank line (`\r\n\r\n`).
*   **Body:** The actual content of the email message.

Email systems and libraries, like the `mail` gem, rely on specific delimiters, primarily newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`), to parse and interpret email headers.  **Header injection occurs when an attacker can inject their own newline characters and additional headers into the header section of an email by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct email headers.**

By injecting newline characters and crafting malicious headers, an attacker can:

*   **Add arbitrary headers:**  Inject headers like `Bcc` to secretly send copies of emails, `Cc` to add unintended recipients, `Reply-To` to redirect replies, or even manipulate `From` to spoof the sender's address.
*   **Terminate the header section prematurely:** Inject `\r\n\r\n` to prematurely end the header section and start the email body earlier than intended, potentially leading to content injection or misinterpretation of the email structure.
*   **Modify existing headers:** In some cases, depending on the parsing logic and the specific header being targeted, attackers might be able to modify existing headers, although this is less common than adding new headers.

#### 4.2. `mail` Gem and Header Injection

The `mail` gem provides a flexible and powerful API for creating and sending emails in Ruby. While the gem itself is not inherently vulnerable, **incorrect usage by developers, particularly when handling user input for email headers, can easily lead to header injection vulnerabilities.**

**Vulnerable Practices with `mail` Gem:**

*   **Direct String Concatenation for Headers:**  The most common mistake is directly concatenating user-provided data into header strings without proper sanitization.

    ```ruby
    # Vulnerable Code Example
    user_subject = params[:subject] # User input from a web form
    mail = Mail.new do
      from     'sender@example.com'
      to       'recipient@example.com'
      subject  "Subject: #{user_subject}" # Direct concatenation - VULNERABLE!
      body     'This is the email body.'
    end
    mail.deliver_now
    ```

    In this example, if `params[:subject]` contains `Important!\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, the resulting `Subject` header will become:

    ```
    Subject: Subject: Important!
    Bcc: attacker@example.com
    ```

    This injects a `Bcc` header, causing a copy of the email to be sent to `attacker@example.com`.

*   **Using `header` method with unsanitized input:** While the `mail` gem provides a `header` method to set custom headers, using it with unsanitized user input is equally dangerous.

    ```ruby
    # Vulnerable Code Example
    user_reply_to = params[:reply_to] # User input
    mail = Mail.new do
      from     'sender@example.com'
      to       'recipient@example.com'
      subject  'Email Subject'
      header   'Reply-To', user_reply_to # Potentially vulnerable if user_reply_to is not sanitized
      body     'This is the email body.'
    end
    mail.deliver_now
    ```

    If `user_reply_to` contains `valid@example.com\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, it will inject a `Bcc` header.

**Secure Practices with `mail` Gem:**

*   **Using `mail` gem's API for header assignment:** The `mail` gem's API is designed to handle header encoding and formatting correctly.  **Directly assigning values to header attributes (e.g., `mail.subject = ...`, `mail.from = ...`) is generally safer than string concatenation or using the `header` method with unsanitized input.** The gem often performs some level of encoding or sanitization internally, although relying solely on this is not recommended and explicit sanitization is still crucial.

    ```ruby
    # More Secure Code Example (Still needs input validation/sanitization)
    sanitized_subject = sanitize_input(params[:subject]) # Assume sanitize_input function exists
    mail = Mail.new do
      from     'sender@example.com'
      to       'recipient@example.com'
      subject  sanitized_subject # Assigning to attribute - better, but still sanitize!
      body     'This is the email body.'
    end
    mail.deliver_now
    ```

*   **Explicit Input Validation and Sanitization:**  **Regardless of how headers are set using the `mail` gem, rigorous input validation and sanitization of all user-provided data used in headers is *critical*.** This includes:
    *   **Validating allowed characters:** Restricting input to alphanumeric characters, spaces, and specific safe symbols.
    *   **Encoding special characters:** Encoding newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and other control characters that could be used for injection.
    *   **Using context-aware output encoding:**  If headers are constructed from templates or external data, ensure proper encoding is applied based on the context (email header).

#### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

1.  **Spam and Phishing Distribution (Bcc Injection):**

    *   **Scenario:** An attacker exploits a header injection vulnerability in a contact form or user registration system that sends confirmation emails.
    *   **Attack:** The attacker injects a `Bcc` header with a list of email addresses they control.
    *   **Impact:** The application unknowingly becomes a spam relay, sending unsolicited emails to the attacker's list. This can damage the application's domain reputation and lead to blacklisting. Phishing emails can also be distributed in this manner, appearing to originate from a legitimate source.

2.  **Email Spoofing (From Header Manipulation):**

    *   **Scenario:** An application allows users to set a "sender name" that is used in the `From` header.
    *   **Attack:** An attacker injects newline characters and modifies the `From` header to spoof the sender's email address.
    *   **Impact:**  Emails appear to originate from a different, potentially trusted, sender. This can be used for phishing attacks, social engineering, or damaging the reputation of the spoofed entity.

3.  **Bypassing Security Filters (Subject/Body Manipulation):**

    *   **Scenario:** An application sends email notifications that are processed by email security filters (e.g., spam filters, DLP).
    *   **Attack:** An attacker injects content into the `Subject` or potentially manipulates headers to alter the email body structure in a way that bypasses security filters.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious content (e.g., phishing links, malware attachments disguised within the body) can bypass security filters and reach recipients, leading to successful attacks.

4.  **Denial of Service (Header Length/Complexity):**

    *   **Scenario:**  While less common for simple header injection, in some systems, excessively long or complex headers caused by injection could potentially lead to resource exhaustion or parsing errors on the receiving email server, causing a denial of service.

#### 4.4. Impact

The impact of successful header injection vulnerabilities can be significant:

*   **Email Spoofing:**  Damages trust and can be used for phishing and social engineering attacks.
*   **Spam/Phishing Distribution:**  Leads to blacklisting, reputation damage, and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Bypassing Security Filters:**  Allows malicious content to reach users, increasing the risk of malware infections and data breaches.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Users and customers lose trust in the application and organization if it's used to distribute spam or phishing emails.
*   **Legal Consequences:**  Depending on jurisdiction and the nature of the attack, there could be legal ramifications for organizations that fail to adequately protect against header injection vulnerabilities, especially if they are used for malicious purposes.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

**Developers using the `mail` gem must implement the following mitigation strategies to prevent header injection vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Critical):**

    *   **Validate all user input:**  Before using any user-provided data in email headers, rigorously validate the input. Define strict rules for allowed characters, length, and format.
    *   **Sanitize input:**  Sanitize user input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters, especially newline characters (`\n`, `\r`).  Consider using a robust sanitization library or function that is context-aware for email headers.
    *   **Example Sanitization (Ruby):**

        ```ruby
        def sanitize_header_input(input)
          # Remove newline characters and control characters
          input.gsub(/[\r\n\x00-\x1F\x7F]/, '').strip
        end

        sanitized_subject = sanitize_header_input(params[:subject])
        mail.subject = sanitized_subject
        ```

2.  **Use `mail` gem's API Securely:**

    *   **Prefer attribute assignment:**  Utilize the `mail` gem's API by directly assigning values to header attributes (e.g., `mail.subject = ...`, `mail.from = ...`, `mail.to = ...`) after sanitization. This is generally safer than string concatenation or using the `header` method with unsanitized input.
    *   **Use `header` method with caution:** If you need to use the `header` method for custom headers, ensure that the values are thoroughly sanitized *before* being passed to the `header` method.

3.  **Limit User Control over Headers:**

    *   **Minimize user-configurable headers:**  Reduce the number of email headers that users can directly control. Pre-define headers like `From`, `Content-Type`, and other control headers whenever possible.
    *   **Control specific content areas:**  Instead of allowing users to set arbitrary headers, focus on allowing them to control specific, well-defined content areas within the email body or specific, pre-defined header fields (after strict validation).

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Emails (where applicable):**

    *   If emails generated by the application are rendered in a browser context (e.g., HTML emails viewed in a webmail client), consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in the email's HTML content. CSP can help mitigate risks from injected content within the email body itself, although it does not directly prevent header injection.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**

    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications that send emails, specifically focusing on header injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement automated security testing as part of the development lifecycle to catch potential vulnerabilities early.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of header injection vulnerabilities in applications using the `mail` gem and protect their users and systems from the associated threats.
