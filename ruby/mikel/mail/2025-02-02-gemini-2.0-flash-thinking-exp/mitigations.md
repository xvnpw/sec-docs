# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mikel/mail

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Email Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/validate_email_inputs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all email input points:** Locate every place in your application where users can provide email-related data (e.g., registration forms, contact forms, password reset requests, email composition features).
    2.  **Implement server-side validation:**  Use regular expressions or dedicated email validation libraries within your application's backend code to check if the provided input conforms to a valid email address format.
        *   Example (Ruby using regex): `input_email =~ /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i`
    3.  **Reject invalid inputs:** If the email input fails validation, reject it immediately and provide clear error messages to the user, guiding them to correct the input.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Email Header Injection** - Severity: High
    *   **Spam/Abuse via Form Submission** - Severity: Medium
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Invalid Email Addresses)** - Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Email Header Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing attackers from injecting malicious headers through manipulated email input fields.
    *   **Spam/Abuse via Form Submission:** Reduces the likelihood of automated scripts submitting invalid or malicious email addresses for spamming or other abusive purposes.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Invalid Email Addresses):** Prevents storage of invalid email addresses, ensuring reliable communication and data quality.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic email format validation using regular expressions is implemented in user registration and contact forms.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More robust validation using dedicated email validation libraries for edge cases and internationalized email addresses.
    *   Validation is not consistently applied across all email input points in the application (e.g., password reset form might lack strict validation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Email Inputs for Header Inclusion](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_email_inputs_for_header_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify user inputs used in headers:** Pinpoint all instances where user-provided data is incorporated into email headers (e.g., `Subject`, custom headers).
    2.  **Use `mail` gem's encoding methods:**  Utilize the `mail` gem's built-in encoding functionalities (like `Mail::Encodings.b_value_encode` or `Mail::Encodings.q_value_encode`) when constructing headers with user input. These methods properly encode special characters to prevent header injection.
    3.  **Limit header usage from user input:** Minimize the use of user input directly in headers. If possible, use predefined headers or construct headers programmatically based on validated and sanitized data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Email Header Injection** - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Email Header Injection:**  Drastically reduces the risk by ensuring that user-provided data is properly encoded and cannot be interpreted as email header commands, preventing attackers from manipulating email behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `mail` gem is used for email sending, but explicit encoding of user-provided subject lines is not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of `Mail::Encodings` or similar encoding methods for all user-provided data used in email headers, especially the `Subject` line in contact forms and password reset emails.
    *   Review and refactor code to minimize direct inclusion of user input in headers where possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Attachment Filenames](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_attachment_filenames.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Intercept attachment uploads:**  When users upload files as attachments, intercept the filename before it's processed or stored.
    2.  **Implement filename sanitization:** Apply a sanitization process to the filename:
        *   **Remove or replace dangerous characters:** Remove or replace characters like `/`, `\`, `..`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `|`, control characters, and spaces with safe alternatives (e.g., underscores, dashes).
        *   **Limit filename length:** Enforce a maximum filename length to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in systems processing filenames.
        *   **Consider using UUIDs:**  Generate a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) as the internal filename for storage and processing. Store the original sanitized filename separately for display purposes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **File Path Traversal** - Severity: High
    *   **Remote Code Execution (in some scenarios)** - Severity: High (depending on application logic and file processing)
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filename (in specific contexts)** - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **File Path Traversal:**  Significantly reduces the risk by preventing attackers from manipulating filenames to access or overwrite files outside of the intended attachment storage directory.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Reduces the risk in scenarios where filename processing might be vulnerable to exploits based on specially crafted filenames.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filename:** Reduces the risk in specific contexts where filenames are directly displayed in web pages without proper encoding, potentially leading to XSS if malicious filenames are crafted.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic file type validation is implemented for attachments (e.g., allowing only images and documents).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Robust filename sanitization is not implemented. Filenames are stored as uploaded, potentially containing harmful characters.
    *   UUIDs are not used for internal storage of attachments; original filenames are used directly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTML Sanitization for Email Body Display](./mitigation_strategies/html_sanitization_for_email_body_display.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify email body display points:** Locate where email bodies (especially HTML emails) parsed by the `mail` gem are displayed in your application (e.g., email inbox view, notification displays).
    2.  **Integrate an HTML sanitization library:** Choose a robust HTML sanitization library for your programming language (e.g., `rails-html-sanitizer` or `sanitize` in Ruby, `bleach` in Python, `DOMPurify` in JavaScript for client-side).
    3.  **Sanitize HTML email bodies before display:** Before rendering HTML email content in a browser, pass it through the HTML sanitization library. Configure the library to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML tags, attributes, and JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onclick`, `javascript:` URLs).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Severity: High
    *   **Phishing and Content Spoofing** - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Significantly reduces the risk by preventing attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML into emails that could be executed in users' browsers when viewing the email.
    *   **Phishing and Content Spoofing:** Reduces the risk of attackers using HTML emails to create convincing phishing attempts or spoof legitimate content within the email display.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Plain text emails are displayed as is. HTML emails are displayed without sanitization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of an HTML sanitization library to sanitize HTML email bodies before displaying them to users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Attachment Scanning for Malware](./mitigation_strategies/attachment_scanning_for_malware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a malware scanning solution:** Select an antivirus or malware scanning service or library that can be integrated into your application's workflow. Options include cloud-based scanning APIs or on-premise solutions.
    2.  **Integrate scanning into attachment processing:**  Modify your application to automatically scan all incoming and outgoing email attachments using the chosen malware scanning solution *before* they are stored, processed, or delivered.
    3.  **Define actions for malware detection:**  Determine how to handle attachments identified as malicious:
        *   **Quarantine:** Move the email and attachment to a quarantine area for administrator review.
        *   **Reject:** Reject the email entirely and notify the sender (if applicable and safe to do so).
        *   **Remove attachment:** Remove the malicious attachment and deliver the email without it, notifying the recipient about the removed attachment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Distribution via Email Attachments** - Severity: High
    *   **Compromise of User Systems** - Severity: High
    *   **Data Breach via Malware** - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Distribution via Email Attachments:**  Significantly reduces the risk of your application being used to distribute malware through email attachments.
    *   **Compromise of User Systems:** Protects users of your application from being infected by malware delivered via email attachments.
    *   **Data Breach via Malware:** Reduces the risk of malware infections leading to data breaches or system compromise within your application's environment.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No malware scanning is currently implemented for email attachments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of a malware scanning solution into the email attachment processing workflow for both incoming and outgoing emails.
    *   Definition of policies and procedures for handling emails with malicious attachments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SMTP Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_smtp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS/STARTTLS:** Configure the `mail` gem to use TLS/STARTTLS for SMTP connections. This encrypts the communication channel between your application and the mail server.
        *   In `mail` gem configuration: `delivery_method :smtp, address: 'smtp.example.com', port: 587, enable_starttls_auto: true`
    2.  **Verify SSL/TLS certificate:**  Enable SSL/TLS certificate verification to ensure you are connecting to the legitimate mail server and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   In `mail` gem configuration: `delivery_method :smtp, ..., ssl: { verify_mode: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER }`
    3.  **Securely store SMTP credentials:**  Do not hardcode SMTP credentials directly in your application code. Use environment variables, secure configuration management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files to store credentials securely.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** - Severity: High
    *   **Credential Exposure** - Severity: High
    *   **Data Interception (Email Content and Credentials)** - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**  Significantly reduces the risk by encrypting communication and verifying the mail server's identity, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or tamper with email traffic.
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Reduces the risk of SMTP credentials being exposed in source code or configuration files by promoting secure storage practices.
    *   **Data Interception (Email Content and Credentials):** Protects sensitive email content and SMTP credentials from being intercepted during transmission.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   SMTP is used for sending emails, and STARTTLS is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SSL/TLS certificate verification is not explicitly enabled.
    *   SMTP credentials are stored in environment variables, but could be further secured using a dedicated secret management system.
