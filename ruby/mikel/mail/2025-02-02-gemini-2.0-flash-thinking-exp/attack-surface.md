# Attack Surface Analysis for mikel/mail

## Attack Surface: [1. Email Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__email_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical flaws in the `mail` gem's parsing of email messages (headers, body, MIME structures) can be exploited by maliciously crafted emails, leading to severe consequences.
*   **`mail` Contribution:** The `mail` gem is the core component responsible for interpreting and processing email data. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic directly expose the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends an email with a complex, deeply nested MIME structure that triggers a buffer overflow or excessive resource consumption in the `mail` gem's parser, leading to a Denial of Service or potentially Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution (in less common but possible scenarios), significant application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Immediately update `mail` gem:**  Prioritize updating to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities. This is critical.
        *   **Implement robust error handling:**  Ensure the application gracefully handles parsing errors and prevents crashes or resource exhaustion.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for email parsing to mitigate DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [2. Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper and insecure handling of email attachments processed by the `mail` gem can result in malware distribution, unauthorized file access (path traversal), and server compromise.
*   **`mail` Contribution:** The `mail` gem provides direct access to attachment content, filenames, and content types, making it a central point for attachment processing vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends an email with a malicious executable attachment. The application, using `mail` to access attachments, saves this file to a publicly accessible directory without proper sanitization or virus scanning, leading to malware distribution or potential server compromise if the file is executed. Path traversal via manipulated filenames is another critical example.
*   **Impact:** Malware Distribution, Path Traversal, Remote Code Execution (if malicious attachments are executed), Server Compromise, Data Breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Virus Scanning:** Implement mandatory virus scanning of all attachments *before* any processing or saving.
        *   **Strict Attachment Whitelisting:**  Restrict allowed attachment types to the absolute minimum necessary. Blacklisting is less secure than whitelisting.
        *   **Robust Filename Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize attachment filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   **Secure Attachment Storage:** Store attachments in secure, non-publicly accessible locations with strict access controls.
        *   **Sandboxed Processing:** Process attachments in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of malicious files.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid automatic processing or execution of attachments. Require explicit user action.

## Attack Surface: [3. SMTP/IMAP Interaction Vulnerabilities (Client-Side)](./attack_surfaces/3__smtpimap_interaction_vulnerabilities__client-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configuration or usage of the `mail` gem's SMTP/IMAP client features can lead to the exposure of sensitive credentials and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, compromising email communication security.
*   **`mail` Contribution:** The `mail` gem handles network communication and protocol implementation for SMTP and IMAP clients. Insecure usage directly exposes these communication channels.
*   **Example:** The application is configured to connect to an SMTP server without TLS/SSL encryption. An attacker performing a MitM attack on the network can intercept the unencrypted communication, capturing SMTP credentials and potentially email content being sent. Storing SMTP credentials in plaintext configuration files is another critical vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Credential Exposure, Unauthorized Access to Email Accounts, Data Breach, Loss of Confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL for all SMTP/IMAP connections:**  Mandatory TLS/SSL is crucial to encrypt communication and prevent MitM attacks.
        *   **Secure Credential Management (Critical):** Store SMTP/IMAP credentials using robust secrets management solutions (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets vaults), *never* hardcode or store in plaintext configuration files.
        *   **Regularly audit SMTP/IMAP configurations:**  Periodically review configurations to ensure they adhere to security best practices.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Credentials:** Grant the SMTP/IMAP account used by the application only the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [4. Header Injection Vulnerabilities (Email Sending)](./attack_surfaces/4__header_injection_vulnerabilities__email_sending_.md)

*   **Description:**  Failure to properly sanitize user-controlled data used in email headers when sending emails via the `mail` gem allows attackers to inject malicious headers, leading to email spoofing, spam distribution, and bypassing security filters.
*   **`mail` Contribution:** The `mail` gem provides methods to set email headers. Incorrect usage by directly embedding unsanitized user input into headers creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a "Subject" line for emails. If this subject is directly inserted into the email headers without sanitization, an attacker could input "Subject: Important!\nBcc: attacker@example.com" to inject a `Bcc` header, secretly sending a copy of the email to an attacker-controlled address for spam or phishing purposes. Spoofing the `From` address is another critical example.
*   **Impact:** Email Spoofing, Spam/Phishing Distribution, Bypassing Security Filters, Reputation Damage, Potential Legal Consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Critical):**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user-provided data before using it in email headers. Use context-aware output encoding.
        *   **Use `mail` gem's API securely:** Utilize the `mail` gem's API for header manipulation, avoiding direct string concatenation. Use methods like `mail.subject = sanitized_subject`.
        *   **Limit User Control over Headers:** Minimize user influence over email headers. Pre-define headers whenever possible and only allow users to control specific, well-defined content areas (like the email body).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Emails (where applicable):**  If emails are rendered in a browser context, consider using CSP to mitigate risks from injected content.
