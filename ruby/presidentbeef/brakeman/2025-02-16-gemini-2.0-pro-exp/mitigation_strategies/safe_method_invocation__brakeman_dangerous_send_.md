## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Vulnerability Explanation: Dangerous Send

Ruby's `send` and `public_send` methods allow dynamic method invocation.  They take a method name (as a symbol or string) as an argument and call that method on the receiver object.  The "Dangerous Send" vulnerability arises when the method name being passed to `send` or `public_send` is derived from user-supplied input *without proper validation or sanitization*.

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
  def process
    method_name = params[:method_to_call] # User-controlled input
    object = MyObject.new
    object.send(method_name) # Dangerous!
  end
end

class MyObject
  def safe_method
    puts "This is safe."
  end

  def dangerous_method(arg)
    system(arg) # Executes a shell command!
  end
end
```

If an attacker provides `dangerous_method` as the `method_to_call` parameter, along with a malicious command as an argument, they can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.  Even without arguments, an attacker could call any public method on `MyObject`, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.

### 4.2 Mitigation Step Breakdown

The mitigation strategy provides a clear, step-by-step approach:

1.  **Run Brakeman:** This is the crucial first step.  Brakeman's static analysis engine is designed to identify potentially dangerous uses of `send` and `public_send`.

2.  **Analyze Dangerous Send Warnings:**  Brakeman's report provides essential context:
    *   **File and Line Number:** Pinpoints the exact location of the vulnerable code.
    *   **Specific `send` Call:** Identifies the receiver object and the method name argument.
    *   **Confidence Level:** Indicates Brakeman's certainty about the vulnerability.  High confidence warnings should be prioritized.
    *   **User Input:** Brakeman often traces the flow of user input to the `send` call, highlighting the source of the vulnerability.

3.  **Eliminate User Input (Brakeman-Guided):** This is the *ideal* solution.  Refactor the code to avoid using user input to determine the method name.  This might involve:
    *   Using a `case` statement or a hash lookup to map user input to specific, pre-defined actions.
    *   Using separate controller actions for different operations, instead of a single action that dynamically dispatches based on user input.

    **Example (Refactored - Eliminating User Input):**

    ```ruby
    class MyController < ApplicationController
      def process
        case params[:action_type]
        when 'safe'
          MyObject.new.safe_method
        when 'another_safe'
          MyObject.new.another_safe_method
        else
          # Handle invalid input
          render plain: "Invalid action", status: :bad_request
        end
      end
    end
    ```

4.  **Implement Whitelisting (Brakeman Focus):** If dynamic method invocation is *absolutely necessary*, and user input *must* be used to select the method, a whitelist is the next best defense.  A whitelist is a pre-approved list of allowed method names (usually as symbols).

    **Example (Refactored - Whitelisting):**

    ```ruby
    class MyController < ApplicationController
      ALLOWED_METHODS = [:safe_method, :another_safe_method].freeze

      def process
        method_name = params[:method_to_call].to_sym
        object = MyObject.new

        if ALLOWED_METHODS.include?(method_name)
          object.send(method_name)
        else
          # Handle invalid input
          render plain: "Invalid method", status: :bad_request
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    **Key Considerations for Whitelisting:**
    *   **Use Symbols:** Symbols are more efficient and less prone to certain types of attacks than strings.
    *   **Constant:** Define the whitelist as a constant (e.g., `ALLOWED_METHODS`) to prevent accidental modification.
    *   **Strict Enforcement:**  Ensure that any input *not* on the whitelist is rejected.  Do *not* attempt to "sanitize" the input; simply reject it.
    *   **Minimize Whitelist Size:**  The smaller the whitelist, the smaller the attack surface.

5.  **Re-run Brakeman:** After implementing either elimination of user input or whitelisting, re-running Brakeman is essential for verification.  The original "Dangerous Send" warnings should be gone.  If they persist, it indicates that the mitigation was not implemented correctly or that there are other instances of the vulnerability.

6.  **Test thoroughly:** Create unit and integration tests.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test the `MyObject` class directly, ensuring that only allowed methods can be called through the whitelisted mechanism (if used).
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire controller action, including various valid and invalid inputs for `params[:method_to_call]` (or the relevant parameter).  These tests should verify that:
        *   Allowed methods execute correctly.
        *   Invalid method names are rejected with an appropriate error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
        *   No unexpected methods can be called.

### 4.3 Brakeman Integration

Brakeman plays a central role throughout the mitigation process:

*   **Detection:**  Brakeman's primary function is to *detect* potential "Dangerous Send" vulnerabilities.  Its static analysis engine examines the code for calls to `send` and `public_send` and analyzes how the method name argument is derived.
*   **Contextual Information:**  Brakeman provides crucial context, including the file, line number, confidence level, and often the source of user input.  This information is essential for understanding the vulnerability and implementing the correct mitigation.
*   **Verification:**  After implementing mitigations, Brakeman is used to *verify* that the vulnerabilities have been addressed.  Re-running Brakeman should result in the disappearance of the original warnings.
* **False Positives:** It is important understand that Brakeman can generate false positives. That is why confidence level is important.

### 4.4 Threat Mitigation Analysis

The "Safe Method Invocation" strategy, when implemented correctly, effectively mitigates the following threats:

*   **Arbitrary Method Execution (High Severity):** This is the primary threat.  By preventing user-controlled input from directly determining the method name, the strategy eliminates the possibility of an attacker calling arbitrary methods on the object.  Whitelisting, while less ideal than eliminating user input, still restricts the attacker to a pre-defined set of safe methods.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Arbitrary method execution can often lead to information disclosure.  By preventing arbitrary method execution, the strategy indirectly mitigates this threat.  For example, an attacker might try to call a method that exposes sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):**  Arbitrary method execution can also be used to cause a denial of service.  An attacker might call a method that consumes excessive resources, crashes the application, or enters an infinite loop.  The mitigation strategy prevents this by limiting the methods that can be called.

### 4.5 Implementation Considerations

*   **Legacy Code:**  Refactoring legacy code to eliminate user input from `send` calls can be challenging and time-consuming.  Thorough testing is crucial after any refactoring.
*   **Dynamic Dispatch:**  In some cases, dynamic dispatch (using `send`) might be deeply ingrained in the application's architecture.  Carefully evaluate whether the dynamic dispatch is truly necessary.  If it is, whitelisting is essential.
*   **Performance:**  While `send` is generally fast, excessive use of dynamic dispatch can have a minor performance impact compared to direct method calls.  However, the security benefits far outweigh any potential performance concerns.
*   **Maintainability:**  Whitelists require maintenance.  Whenever new methods are added that need to be accessible through the dynamic mechanism, the whitelist must be updated.  This should be a deliberate and documented process.
* **False Positives:** Brakeman can generate false positives. It is important to analyze each warning.

### 4.6 Testing and Verification

*   **Brakeman:** As mentioned, re-running Brakeman is the primary automated verification method.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Test the class containing the `send` call in isolation.  Verify that:
    *   Allowed methods (if using a whitelist) can be called successfully.
    *   Invalid method names are rejected.
    *   No unexpected behavior occurs.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire flow, including user input and the resulting response.  Verify that:
    *   Valid inputs result in the expected behavior.
    *   Invalid inputs (e.g., attempting to call a non-whitelisted method) are rejected with an appropriate error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
*   **Manual Code Review:**  Even with automated tools, manual code review is important to ensure that the mitigation is implemented correctly and that there are no subtle vulnerabilities.

### 4.7 Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Vulnerable Code (Already Shown Above)**

```ruby
# ... (Vulnerable code from section 4.1) ...
```

**Scenario 2: Mitigated - Eliminating User Input**

```ruby
# ... (Refactored code from section 4.2, eliminating user input) ...
```

**Scenario 3: Mitigated - Whitelisting**

```ruby
# ... (Refactored code from section 4.2, using a whitelist) ...
```

**Scenario 4: False Positive**
```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController

  def process
    method_name = :safe_method
    object = MyObject.new
    object.send(method_name)
  end
end
```
Brakeman can generate warning, but it is false positive, because method_name is hardcoded.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Safe Method Invocation" mitigation strategy, when used in conjunction with Brakeman, is a highly effective approach to preventing "Dangerous Send" vulnerabilities in Ruby applications.  The strategy emphasizes eliminating user input from determining the method name passed to `send` or `public_send`.  When this is not possible, a strict whitelist of allowed method names should be used.  Brakeman plays a crucial role in detecting, understanding, and verifying the mitigation.  Thorough testing, including unit and integration tests, is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented solution.  By following this strategy, developers can significantly reduce the risk of arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and denial-of-service attacks stemming from the misuse of `send`.
