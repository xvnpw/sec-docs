# Threat Model Analysis for presidentbeef/brakeman

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Gem](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_gem.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Gem
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Brakeman gem on RubyGems or a mirror. Developers unknowingly install the malicious gem. The compromised gem could contain code that introduces vulnerabilities into the development environment, steals credentials, or performs other malicious actions. While less likely, it *could* theoretically inject malicious code into the application being scanned, although this is not Brakeman's primary function.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the development environment, potential data theft, and, in a worst-case scenario, introduction of vulnerabilities into the application.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** The entire Brakeman gem package (`brakeman-*.gem`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a `Gemfile.lock` to pin the Brakeman version to a known-good version.
        *   Regularly update dependencies, but review changes carefully.
        *   Consider using gem signing to verify the authenticity of the gem.
        *   Monitor security advisories for RubyGems and Brakeman.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.
        *   Use a private gem repository with strict access controls.

## Threat: [False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities](./threats/false_negatives_leading_to_undetected_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability that Brakeman *should* have detected but didn't. This could be due to a limitation in Brakeman's rules, a new type of vulnerability not yet covered, or a complex code pattern that evades detection. The attacker might use a known exploit or develop a zero-day based on the missed vulnerability. This is a *direct* threat because it relates to Brakeman's core functionality failing.
    *   **Impact:** The application is compromised, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, or other negative consequences.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** Potentially any of Brakeman's analysis modules (e.g., `lib/brakeman/checks/`, specific checkers like `CheckCrossSiteScripting`, `CheckSQLInjection`, etc.). The issue is a *lack* of a rule or an inadequate rule.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Supplement Brakeman with other security testing methods (DAST, IAST, manual code review, penetration testing).
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices.
        *   Regularly update Brakeman.
        *   Contribute to Brakeman by reporting false negatives.
        *   Use multiple static analysis tools.

## Threat: [Using an Outdated Brakeman Version](./threats/using_an_outdated_brakeman_version.md)

* **Threat:** Using an Outdated Brakeman Version
    * **Description:** Developers continue to use an old version of Brakeman. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that would have been detected by a newer version of Brakeman, as the old version lacks the necessary checks. This is a direct threat as it's a failure to utilize Brakeman's updated capabilities.
    * **Impact:** The application is vulnerable to attacks that could have been prevented by updating Brakeman.
    * **Affected Brakeman Component:** All analysis modules (`lib/brakeman/checks/`) are potentially affected, as new checks and updates are missed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a process for regularly updating Brakeman.
        * Automate updates within the CI/CD pipeline, with appropriate testing.
        * Subscribe to Brakeman's release announcements or changelog.
        * Use dependency management tools to enforce minimum version requirements.
