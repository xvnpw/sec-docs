# Attack Surface Analysis for presidentbeef/brakeman

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Brakeman relies on external Ruby gems. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be directly exploited when Brakeman is executed.
*   **How Brakeman Contributes:** Brakeman's core functionality depends on these potentially vulnerable components. The act of running Brakeman triggers the execution of these dependencies.
*   **Example:** A gem used for parsing Ruby code within Brakeman has a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. An attacker crafts a malicious Ruby file that, when *scanned by Brakeman*, triggers the RCE, compromising the CI/CD server.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the system running Brakeman (CI/CD server, developer workstation), leading to access to source code, credentials, and sensitive data. Potential for lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if Brakeman runs with elevated privileges in CI/CD).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Brakeman and all its dependencies updated using `bundle update brakeman` and `bundle update`.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `bundler-audit`, `gemnasium`, or Dependabot to automatically detect and report known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gemfile.lock:** Use a `Gemfile.lock` for consistent dependency versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories for Ruby gems and Brakeman.

## Attack Surface: [2. Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/2__supply_chain_attacks_on_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source of one of Brakeman's dependencies, injecting malicious code. This malicious code is executed when Brakeman runs.
*   **How Brakeman Contributes:** Using Brakeman means implicitly trusting its dependency chain. A compromised dependency becomes a direct attack vector *through* Brakeman's execution.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a gem author's account and publishes a malicious version of a gem used by Brakeman. When Brakeman runs, it executes the compromised gem's code.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, and potential lateral movement, all triggered by running Brakeman with the compromised dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Signed Gems:** Preferentially use digitally signed gems (where available).
    *   **Dependency Monitoring (Advanced):** Monitor for suspicious activity related to Brakeman's dependencies.
    *   **Vendoring (Extreme):** Consider vendoring critical dependencies for highly sensitive environments.
    *   **Review Dependency Maintainers:** Evaluate security practices of maintainers.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Report Storage](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_report_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Brakeman *generates* reports detailing potential vulnerabilities. Insecure storage of these Brakeman-generated reports exposes sensitive information.
*   **How Brakeman Contributes:** Brakeman *creates* these reports; their security is a direct consequence of using the tool. The vulnerability exists because of Brakeman's output.
*   **Example:** Brakeman reports are automatically saved to a publicly accessible S3 bucket.
*   **Impact:** Attackers gain a roadmap of the application's vulnerabilities, facilitating exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Access Control:** Store reports with strict access controls (private S3 buckets, secure file shares).
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt reports at rest.
    *   **.gitignore:** Add Brakeman report files to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Secure Sharing:** Implement a secure process for sharing reports.
    *   **Short Retention:** Implement a policy for automatic deletion of old reports.

## Attack Surface: [4. Ignoring High-Confidence Warnings](./attack_surfaces/4__ignoring_high-confidence_warnings.md)

*   **Description:** Developers disregard high-confidence warnings *generated by Brakeman*, leaving known vulnerabilities unaddressed.
*   **How Brakeman Contributes:** This risk is directly tied to the output of Brakeman. The warnings exist *because* Brakeman found them.
*   **Example:** Brakeman reports a high-confidence SQL injection vulnerability, but it's ignored.
*   **Impact:** The application remains vulnerable to the attacks Brakeman identified.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** Block builds with high-confidence warnings.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:** Establish clear policies for addressing warnings.
    *   **Vulnerability Tracking:** Use a system to track and monitor resolution.
    *   **Security Champions:** Appoint champions to advocate for security.

## Attack Surface: [5. Compromised Execution Environment (CI/CD)](./attack_surfaces/5__compromised_execution_environment__cicd_.md)

*   **Description:** The CI/CD server where Brakeman *runs* is compromised, allowing attackers to manipulate Brakeman or access its results.
*   **How Brakeman Contributes:** Brakeman's security is directly tied to the security of its execution environment.  If the environment is compromised, Brakeman is compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD server and modifies Brakeman's configuration to suppress warnings.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can access source code, credentials, and manipulate scan results, potentially hiding vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server Hardening:** Implement strong security measures for CI/CD servers: patching, access control, intrusion detection, least privilege.
    *   **Isolated Environments:** Run Brakeman in a dedicated, isolated environment (container, VM).
