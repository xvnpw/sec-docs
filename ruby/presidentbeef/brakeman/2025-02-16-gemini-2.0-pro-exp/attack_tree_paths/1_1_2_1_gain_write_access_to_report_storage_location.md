# Brakeman Report Storage Attack Tree Path Deep Analysis

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the attack path "1.1.2.1 Gain write access to report storage location" within the broader Brakeman security assessment context.  The primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their likelihood and impact, and recommend concrete mitigation strategies to prevent unauthorized modification of Brakeman reports.  This analysis is crucial because compromised reports could mislead developers and mask real security issues, leading to unpatched vulnerabilities in the application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the scenario where an attacker attempts to gain write access to the location where Brakeman reports are stored.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **File System Storage:**  Reports stored directly on the server's file system (e.g., in a dedicated directory).
*   **Database Storage:** Reports stored within a database (e.g., as BLOBs or text fields).
*   **Cloud Storage:** Reports stored in cloud-based object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).
*   **Network Shares:** Reports stored on network-accessible file shares (e.g., SMB/CIFS, NFS).

The analysis *excludes* attacks targeting the Brakeman tool itself (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in Brakeman's code to generate false reports).  It also excludes attacks that aim to *read* the reports (confidentiality breaches), focusing solely on *write* access (integrity breaches).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling:**  Identifying potential threat actors, their motivations, and capabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examining common vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized write access.
*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyzing (hypothetically, since we don't have the specific application code) how the application interacts with the report storage mechanism.  This will involve looking for patterns known to be vulnerable.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing the application's (hypothetical) implementation against established security best practices for file and data storage.
*   **Penetration Testing Principles:** Considering how a penetration tester might attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2.1 Gain write access to report storage location

**4.1 Threat Actors and Motivations:**

*   **Malicious Insiders:**  Developers, system administrators, or other individuals with legitimate access to some parts of the system, who might abuse their privileges to tamper with reports.  Motivation could be to hide vulnerabilities they introduced, avoid blame, or sabotage the project.
*   **External Attackers:**  Individuals or groups with no legitimate access, who gain unauthorized access through other vulnerabilities.  Motivation could be to discredit the organization, manipulate data for financial gain, or prepare for a larger attack.
*   **Automated Bots/Scripts:**  Scripts or bots scanning for common vulnerabilities, which might inadvertently or intentionally modify reports if they find a writeable location.

**4.2 Vulnerability Analysis:**

The attack tree path description correctly identifies that gaining write access usually requires exploiting a *separate* vulnerability.  Here's a breakdown of common vulnerabilities that could lead to this:

*   **4.2.1 File System Storage Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Weak File Permissions:**  The most common vulnerability.  If the directory or files containing the reports have overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable, or writeable by a group that includes unintended users), an attacker who gains even limited access to the server can modify the reports.  This is especially dangerous if the web server process itself has write access to the directory.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  If the application uses user-supplied input to construct the path to the report storage location without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to use ".." sequences to navigate outside the intended directory and write to arbitrary locations on the file system.  This is less likely for report *storage* (as opposed to report *retrieval*), but still possible if the storage path is dynamically generated.
    *   **Insecure File Uploads:**  If the application allows file uploads (even if not directly related to Brakeman reports), a vulnerability in the upload mechanism (e.g., lack of file type validation, insufficient filename sanitization) could allow an attacker to upload a malicious file that overwrites a Brakeman report.
    *   **Operating System Vulnerabilities:**  Exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system (e.g., privilege escalation flaws) could allow an attacker to gain write access to the report storage location, even if the application itself is configured securely.

*   **4.2.2 Database Storage Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **SQL Injection:**  If the application uses SQL queries to store or update reports in a database, and those queries are vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to modify the report data.  This is the most likely database-related vulnerability.
    *   **Weak Database Credentials:**  If the application uses weak or default database credentials, an attacker who gains access to the network could connect to the database and modify the reports.
    *   **Insufficient Database Permissions:**  If the database user account used by the application has more privileges than necessary (e.g., write access to tables it doesn't need to modify), an attacker who compromises the application could leverage those privileges to tamper with reports.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** If a NoSQL database is used, similar injection vulnerabilities might exist, depending on the specific database and how it's used.

*   **4.2.3 Cloud Storage Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Similar to weak file permissions, if the cloud storage bucket or objects have overly permissive ACLs (e.g., public write access, or write access granted to unintended users or groups), an attacker could modify the reports.
    *   **Leaked API Keys/Credentials:**  If the application's API keys or credentials for accessing the cloud storage are leaked (e.g., through exposed source code, compromised developer accounts), an attacker could use those credentials to modify the reports.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the application is vulnerable to SSRF, an attacker might be able to trick the application into making requests to the cloud storage API on their behalf, potentially allowing them to modify the reports.

*   **4.2.4 Network Share Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Weak Share Permissions:** Similar to local file permissions, if the network share has overly permissive permissions, unauthorized users on the network could modify the reports.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** If the network share allows unauthenticated access, any user on the network could modify the reports.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in the Sharing Protocol:** Exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the network sharing protocol (e.g., SMB, NFS) could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the share and modify the reports.

**4.3 Likelihood and Impact:**

*   **Likelihood:**  The likelihood of this attack path being successfully exploited depends heavily on the specific vulnerabilities present in the application and its environment.  Weak file permissions and SQL injection are relatively common vulnerabilities, making them higher likelihood threats.  Exploiting operating system vulnerabilities or cloud storage misconfigurations might be less likely, but still possible.
*   **Impact:**  The impact of successfully modifying Brakeman reports is HIGH.  Altered reports could:
    *   **Mask critical vulnerabilities:**  Attackers could remove warnings about vulnerabilities they intend to exploit, preventing developers from fixing them.
    *   **Introduce false positives:**  Attackers could add false warnings to distract developers and waste their time.
    *   **Undermine trust in the security assessment process:**  If developers lose confidence in the accuracy of Brakeman reports, they might ignore legitimate warnings, leading to a false sense of security.
    *   **Facilitate further attacks:**  A compromised report could be used as a stepping stone for further attacks, by providing attackers with information about the application's architecture and vulnerabilities.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies should be implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of Brakeman reports:

*   **4.4.1 General Recommendations:**

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application and its components (e.g., web server, database user) have only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their functions.  This includes limiting write access to the report storage location to only the necessary processes or users.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, path traversal).
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement a secure configuration management process to ensure that all systems and services are configured securely and consistently.
    *   **Patch Management:**  Keep all software (operating system, web server, database, application dependencies) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Report Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of Brakeman reports. This could involve:
        *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign the reports after they are generated, and verify the signature before using them.
        *   **Hashing:**  Calculate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the report and store it separately.  Compare the hash of the report with the stored hash to detect any modifications.
        *   **Audit Logging:**  Log all access to the report storage location, including successful and failed attempts to read or write reports.

*   **4.4.2 File System Specific:**

    *   **Strict File Permissions:**  Set the file permissions on the report storage directory and files to be as restrictive as possible.  Only the process that needs to write the reports should have write access.  Avoid using world-writable or group-writable permissions.
    *   **Dedicated Directory:**  Store Brakeman reports in a dedicated directory that is not accessible from the web root.
    *   **Chroot Jail (if applicable):**  Consider running the application or the process that generates the reports in a chroot jail to limit its access to the file system.

*   **4.4.3 Database Specific:**

    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Never construct SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied input.
    *   **Strong Database Credentials:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all database user accounts.
    *   **Least Privilege Database User:**  Create a dedicated database user account for the application with only the necessary privileges to access the report data.  Avoid using the database administrator account.
    *   **Database Firewall:**  Configure a database firewall to restrict access to the database to only authorized hosts.

*   **4.4.4 Cloud Storage Specific:**

    *   **Strict ACLs:**  Configure the ACLs on the cloud storage bucket and objects to be as restrictive as possible.  Only grant write access to the necessary IAM roles or users.
    *   **Use IAM Roles:**  Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys whenever possible.  IAM roles provide temporary credentials that are automatically rotated.
    *   **Enable Bucket Versioning:**  Enable bucket versioning to allow recovery from accidental or malicious modifications.
    *   **Monitor CloudTrail Logs:**  Monitor CloudTrail logs (or equivalent for other cloud providers) for any suspicious activity related to the report storage bucket.

*   **4.4.5 Network Share Specific:**

    *   **Strict Share Permissions:** Set the share permissions to be as restrictive as possible. Only grant write access to the necessary users or groups.
    *   **Require Authentication:**  Require authentication for access to the network share.
    *   **Use a Secure Protocol:**  Use a secure network sharing protocol (e.g., SMB 3.0 with encryption, NFSv4 with Kerberos).
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the network share to only authorized hosts.
