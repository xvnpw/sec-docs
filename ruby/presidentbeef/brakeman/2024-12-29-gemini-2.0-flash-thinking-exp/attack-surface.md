* **Malicious Code Injection via Brakeman Configuration:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control over Brakeman configuration files (e.g., `.brakeman.yml`) and injects malicious code that is executed when Brakeman runs.
    * **How Brakeman Contributes:** Brakeman's extensibility through custom checks and plugins allows for arbitrary code execution if the configuration is compromised.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies `.brakeman.yml` to include a `require` statement for a malicious Ruby file or a custom check that executes harmful commands.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure access to Brakeman configuration files.
        * Store configuration files in version control and review changes carefully.
        * Restrict the use of custom checks and plugins to trusted sources.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring for configuration files.

* **Exploitation of Brakeman Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Brakeman's dependencies (Ruby gems) are exploited to compromise the environment where Brakeman is running.
    * **How Brakeman Contributes:** Brakeman relies on external libraries, and vulnerabilities in these libraries can introduce security risks.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a gem used by Brakeman. An attacker exploits this vulnerability on the system where Brakeman is executed.
    * **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service on the developer's machine or CI/CD server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Brakeman and its dependencies.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Brakeman's dependencies.
        * Isolate the environment where Brakeman is executed.

* **Code Execution via Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Brakeman or its Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Brakeman or its dependencies utilize deserialization of untrusted data, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    * **How Brakeman Contributes:** If Brakeman processes external data in a deserialized format (though less common), or if its dependencies have such vulnerabilities, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a gem used by Brakeman allows an attacker to craft malicious serialized data that, when processed, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running Brakeman.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using deserialization of untrusted data within Brakeman or its configurations.
        * Keep Brakeman and its dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

* **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Brakeman:**
    * **Description:** The Brakeman project itself is compromised, and malicious code is injected into the tool, affecting all users who install or update it.
    * **How Brakeman Contributes:**  Using Brakeman inherently relies on the security of the Brakeman project and its distribution channels.
    * **Example:** The Brakeman gem on RubyGems.org is compromised, and a malicious version is released, containing code that steals credentials or compromises developer machines.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of development environments and potentially production systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use trusted and reputable sources for installing Brakeman.
        * Verify the integrity of the Brakeman gem using checksums or signatures.
        * Monitor for unusual activity or changes in Brakeman's behavior.
