## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brakeman's Incomplete Coverage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brakeman's_incomplete_coverage.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Brakeman, as a static analysis tool, cannot detect all vulnerability types. Attackers can target areas outside of Brakeman's scope.
    * **High-Risk Sub-Path: Introduce Vulnerabilities in Non-Ruby Code**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in parts of the application that Brakeman doesn't analyze, such as:
            * **Frontend Code (JavaScript, CSS):** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Client-Side Injection, insecure dependencies in frontend frameworks.
            * **Configuration Files:**  Exposed secrets, insecure configurations in application servers, web servers, or databases.
            * **External Services:** Vulnerabilities in APIs, third-party libraries, or cloud services integrated with the application.
        * **Why High-Risk:**  These areas are often overlooked in Ruby/Rails security discussions focused on backend code. Developers might assume Brakeman's presence implies comprehensive security coverage.
    * **High-Risk Sub-Path: Misunderstanding Brakeman's Scope - Critical Node**
        * **Critical Node: Assume Brakeman covers all security aspects and neglect other security measures.**
        * **Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly believe Brakeman is a complete security solution and fail to implement other essential security practices. This leads to a false sense of security and significant gaps in overall application security.
        * **Why Critical:** This is a fundamental misunderstanding that can undermine all security efforts. It's not a specific vulnerability, but a systemic weakness in the security approach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Misinterpretation/Negligence of Brakeman Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_misinterpretationnegligence_of_brakeman_output.md)

* **Critical Node:** This entire path is critical because it highlights the human element as the weakest link in the security chain, even with tools like Brakeman in place.
    * **High-Risk Sub-Path: Ignore or Dismiss Brakeman Warnings - High-Risk Path - Critical Node**
        * **Critical Node:** This sub-path is critical because it represents a direct failure to act on security information provided by Brakeman.
            * **High-Risk Sub-Sub-Path: Treat Warnings as False Positives Incorrectly - High-Risk Path**
                * **Critical Node: Dismiss genuine warnings as false positives without proper investigation.**
                * **Attack Vector:** Developers, due to lack of time, expertise, or perceived urgency, quickly dismiss Brakeman warnings as false positives without thoroughly investigating and verifying them. This leaves real vulnerabilities unaddressed.
                * **Why High-Risk:** False positives are common in static analysis, but a careless approach to dismissing them negates the value of the tool.
            * **High-Risk Sub-Sub-Path: Prioritize Features Over Security - High-Risk Path**
                * **Critical Node: Defer addressing Brakeman warnings due to time constraints or feature prioritization.**
                * **Attack Vector:**  Under pressure to deliver features quickly, development teams postpone addressing Brakeman warnings, accumulating a backlog of security issues. This creates a window of opportunity for attackers.
                * **Why High-Risk:**  Short-term feature focus at the expense of security creates long-term risk.
            * **High-Risk Sub-Sub-Path: Lack of Security Awareness - High-Risk Path - Critical Node**
                * **Critical Node: Developers lack sufficient security knowledge to understand and address Brakeman warnings effectively.**
                * **Attack Vector:** Developers lack the necessary security training and knowledge to properly interpret Brakeman warnings, understand their severity, and implement effective fixes. This leads to misinterpretations, incorrect fixes, or outright neglect of warnings.
                * **Why Critical:**  This is a foundational issue. If developers don't understand security, even the best tools are ineffective.
        * **High-Risk Sub-Path: Inadequate Remediation of Warnings - High-Risk Path**
            * **High-Risk Sub-Sub-Path: Delayed Remediation - High-Risk Path - Critical Node**
                * **Critical Node: Delay fixing warnings, leaving vulnerabilities exposed for a longer period.**
                * **Attack Vector:** Even when warnings are acknowledged and understood, delays in implementing fixes leave vulnerabilities exposed in the application for an extended time. This increases the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit them.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Time is critical in security. The longer a vulnerability exists, the higher the chance of exploitation.
