# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: Improve the security of Ruby on Rails applications by identifying potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - Priority: Provide a reliable, accurate, and easy-to-use static analysis tool that helps developers and security teams proactively address security issues.
  - Goal: Reduce the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities in production Rails applications.
  - Priority: Minimize false positives and false negatives to ensure developers trust and effectively use the tool.
  - Goal: Integrate seamlessly into existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Priority: Support various configuration options and reporting formats to accommodate different project needs and environments.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk: False positives can lead to wasted developer time investigating non-issues, reducing productivity and trust in the tool.
  - Risk: False negatives can result in undetected vulnerabilities reaching production, leading to potential security breaches and reputational damage.
  - Risk: Lack of adoption by developers due to complexity, poor documentation, or integration challenges can limit the tool's effectiveness.
  - Risk: Vulnerabilities in Brakeman itself could be exploited, although less likely for a static analysis tool, it's still a consideration in supply chain security.
  - Risk: Outdated vulnerability signatures or analysis techniques can reduce the tool's effectiveness over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the Brakeman project (GitHub pull requests). Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and workflow.
  - security control: Static analysis of Brakeman's own code using standard Ruby linters and security scanners. Implemented in: Development and CI processes (likely, though not explicitly stated in input).
  - security control: Open source nature of the project allows for community review and scrutiny. Implemented in: Project's open GitHub repository.
  - security control: Dependency management using Bundler to manage and potentially audit dependencies. Implemented in: `Gemfile` and Bundler usage in Ruby projects.
  - security control: Regular updates to vulnerability signatures and analysis rules. Implemented in: Ongoing development and releases of Brakeman.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for false positives and false negatives in vulnerability detection, inherent to static analysis tools.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for vulnerability signatures and rule updates, which might have delays or gaps.
  - accepted risk: Exposure of Brakeman's source code as an open source project, potentially revealing analysis techniques to attackers (though this is generally considered a benefit for security transparency).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of Brakeman's code in CI/CD pipeline, including SAST and dependency vulnerability scanning.
  - security control: Formalize a process for regular review and update of vulnerability signatures and analysis rules, potentially with dedicated security researchers or community contributions.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and guidelines for users on how to interpret and remediate findings, including best practices for secure Rails development.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization within Brakeman itself to prevent potential vulnerabilities if Brakeman processes untrusted input (e.g., configuration files, project code).
  - security control: Consider signing releases to ensure integrity and prevent tampering during distribution.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Brakeman as a static analysis tool. Brakeman itself does not authenticate users. Authentication is relevant to the systems where Brakeman is used (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, developer workstations).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Brakeman itself. Authorization is relevant to the systems where Brakeman is used. Access control to the code repository being scanned and the Brakeman tool itself is managed by the underlying systems.
  - Input Validation: Brakeman needs robust input validation to handle potentially malicious or malformed code and configuration files without crashing or being exploited. This is crucial for the security of Brakeman itself.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary security requirement for Brakeman's core functionality. However, if Brakeman were to handle sensitive data (which it ideally should not), or if secure communication were needed (e.g., for reporting), cryptography would become relevant. For now, it's less critical but should be considered for future features (e.g., secure reporting mechanisms).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Protecting the security of Ruby on Rails applications developed by users of Brakeman.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust in Brakeman as a reliable security tool.
  - Ensuring the integrity and availability of Brakeman as an open-source project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of Ruby on Rails applications being analyzed by Brakeman. Sensitivity: High to Confidential, as source code often contains business logic, sensitive data access patterns, and potential vulnerabilities. Exposure could lead to security breaches or intellectual property theft.
  - Brakeman's own source code. Sensitivity: Medium to Confidential, as vulnerabilities in Brakeman could undermine its effectiveness and potentially be exploited.
  - Brakeman's vulnerability signatures and analysis rules. Sensitivity: Medium to Confidential, as these represent the core intelligence of the tool. Public disclosure of very specific, unpatched vulnerability detection logic could be misused.
  - Security findings and reports generated by Brakeman. Sensitivity: Medium to Confidential, as these reports contain information about potential vulnerabilities in applications. Access should be controlled to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended deployment environment for Brakeman? (Local developer machines, CI/CD pipelines, security team infrastructure?) - *Assumption made: Primarily developer workstations and CI/CD pipelines.*
  - What are the specific reporting formats required? (HTML, JSON, SARIF, etc.) - *Assumption made: Common formats like HTML and JSON are sufficient.*
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements that Brakeman needs to adhere to? (e.g., OWASP, PCI DSS, HIPAA) - *Assumption made: General security best practices are the primary focus, rather than specific compliance mandates.*
  - What is the process for updating vulnerability signatures and analysis rules? - *Assumption made: Community contributions and maintainer updates are the primary mechanisms.*
  - Is there a formal security incident response plan for Brakeman itself? - *Assumption made: Standard open-source project security practices apply, relying on GitHub security features and community reporting.*

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve the security of Ruby on Rails applications and reduce security risks for organizations using Rails.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Brakeman follows standard secure software development practices for open-source projects, with a focus on code review, dependency management, and community contributions.
  - DESIGN: Brakeman is designed as a command-line tool that can be easily integrated into developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines. The architecture is relatively simple, focused on static analysis and reporting.
  - DEPLOYMENT: The primary deployment scenarios are developer workstations for local analysis and CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
  - BUILD: Brakeman uses a standard open-source build process, likely leveraging GitHub Actions for CI/CD and RubyGems for distribution.
