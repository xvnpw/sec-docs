## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Undetected Vulnerability via CI/CD Manipulation

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Exploit the undetected vulnerability in the application (following CI/CD manipulation)" within the context of an application utilizing Brakeman for static analysis.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector where an attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline to manipulate Brakeman, leading to the deployment of vulnerable code without detection. This includes:

* **Deconstructing the attack path:** Breaking down the attack into individual steps and understanding the attacker's actions at each stage.
* **Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses:** Pinpointing the potential weaknesses in the CI/CD pipeline and Brakeman integration that enable this attack.
* **Assessing the potential impact:** Evaluating the consequences of a successful attack, including business impact and security risks.
* **Developing mitigation strategies:** Proposing actionable recommendations to prevent and detect this type of attack.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path: **"Exploit the undetected vulnerability in the application (following CI/CD manipulation)"**. The scope includes:

* **The CI/CD pipeline:**  The infrastructure and processes involved in building, testing, and deploying the application. This includes source code repositories, build servers, deployment tools, and any related scripts or configurations.
* **Brakeman integration:** How Brakeman is configured and executed within the CI/CD pipeline, including configuration files, command-line arguments, and integration points with other tools.
* **The application codebase:**  The source code being analyzed by Brakeman, as the ultimate target is to introduce and exploit vulnerabilities within it.
* **The attacker's perspective:** Understanding the attacker's goals, capabilities, and potential methods.

This analysis **excludes** other potential attack vectors not directly related to CI/CD manipulation of Brakeman, such as direct exploitation of known vulnerabilities in deployed applications or attacks targeting other parts of the infrastructure.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology employed for this deep analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Attack Path Decomposition:** Breaking down the provided attack vector into a sequence of discrete actions an attacker would need to perform.
2. **Threat Modeling:** Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities at each stage of the decomposed attack path.
3. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4. **Control Analysis:** Examining existing security controls within the CI/CD pipeline and Brakeman integration to identify weaknesses and gaps.
5. **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Proposing specific and actionable recommendations to prevent, detect, and respond to this type of attack.
6. **Documentation:**  Clearly documenting the findings, analysis, and recommendations in a structured format.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit the undetected vulnerability in the application (following CI/CD manipulation)

**Attack Vector Breakdown:** The attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline where Brakeman is executed. They then modify Brakeman's configuration or execution within the pipeline to prevent it from detecting vulnerabilities before deployment. This results in vulnerable code being deployed without any security warnings.

**Decomposed Attack Path:**

1. **Initial CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure. This could be achieved through various means:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools:**  Unpatched software, default credentials, or misconfigurations in tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.
    * **Compromising developer accounts:** Phishing, credential stuffing, or malware targeting developers with access to the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Supply chain attacks:** Compromising dependencies or plugins used by the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Insider threat:** Malicious actions by an authorized user.

2. **Locating and Accessing Brakeman Configuration/Execution:** Once inside the CI/CD environment, the attacker needs to identify where Brakeman is configured and executed. This involves:
    * **Examining CI/CD configuration files:**  Locating files like `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, or similar that define the pipeline stages and steps.
    * **Identifying Brakeman invocation:** Finding the specific command or script that runs Brakeman.
    * **Locating Brakeman configuration files:**  Identifying files like `.brakeman.yml` or environment variables that control Brakeman's behavior.

3. **Manipulating Brakeman to Bypass Detection:** The attacker modifies Brakeman's configuration or execution to prevent it from identifying vulnerabilities. This can be done in several ways:
    * **Disabling specific checks:** Modifying the `.brakeman.yml` file to exclude specific warning types that the attacker knows their vulnerability will trigger.
    * **Lowering the warning threshold:** Changing the minimum severity level for warnings to be reported, effectively silencing less severe but still exploitable vulnerabilities.
    * **Excluding specific files or directories:**  Configuring Brakeman to ignore the files or directories containing the injected vulnerable code.
    * **Modifying Brakeman command-line arguments:** Altering the command used to invoke Brakeman to skip certain checks or use a different configuration file.
    * **Replacing the Brakeman executable:**  In a more sophisticated attack, the attacker might replace the legitimate Brakeman executable with a modified version that always reports no findings.
    * **Introducing errors in Brakeman execution:**  Modifying the environment or dependencies in a way that causes Brakeman to fail silently or produce incomplete results.

4. **Injecting Vulnerable Code:**  The attacker introduces the vulnerable code into the application codebase. This could happen before or after manipulating Brakeman, but the manipulation ensures it won't be detected. Methods include:
    * **Directly modifying source code:** If the attacker has write access to the repository.
    * **Introducing malicious dependencies:** Adding compromised libraries or packages.
    * **Exploiting code merge processes:**  Submitting malicious pull requests that are not properly reviewed.

5. **Triggering the CI/CD Pipeline:** The attacker triggers the modified CI/CD pipeline, which now runs Brakeman in a compromised state.

6. **Deployment of Vulnerable Application:** The CI/CD pipeline, believing the code is secure after the manipulated Brakeman scan, proceeds with the deployment of the vulnerable application.

7. **Exploitation of the Undetected Vulnerability:**  Once deployed, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability that Brakeman failed to detect, achieving their ultimate objective (e.g., data breach, service disruption, unauthorized access).

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Security Breach:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, or other security incidents.
* **Data Loss:**  Attackers could steal, modify, or delete critical data.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Recovery from a security incident can be costly, including fines, legal fees, and business disruption.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to detect and prevent vulnerabilities can lead to violations of industry regulations and compliance standards.

**Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses Enabling the Attack:**

* **Insufficient CI/CD Security:** Lack of strong authentication, authorization, and access controls for the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Lack of Integrity Checks:** Absence of mechanisms to verify the integrity of Brakeman's configuration and executable within the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Overly Permissive Access Controls:** Granting excessive permissions to users or processes within the CI/CD environment.
* **Lack of Monitoring and Auditing:** Insufficient logging and monitoring of CI/CD pipeline activities, making it difficult to detect malicious modifications.
* **Insecure Secrets Management:** Storing sensitive credentials (e.g., for accessing repositories or deployment environments) insecurely, allowing attackers to gain access.
* **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not enforcing MFA for access to critical CI/CD resources.
* **Absence of Code Review for CI/CD Configurations:**  Failing to apply the same level of scrutiny to CI/CD configurations as to application code.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strengthen CI/CD Pipeline Security:**
    * **Implement strong authentication and authorization:** Enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts with access to the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes.
    * **Regularly patch and update CI/CD tools:** Keep all software components up-to-date to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure secrets management:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive credentials securely.
    * **Network segmentation:** Isolate the CI/CD environment from other networks to limit the impact of a breach.

* **Enhance Brakeman Integration Security:**
    * **Immutable Brakeman Configuration:**  Store Brakeman configuration in a version-controlled and protected repository, making unauthorized modifications difficult.
    * **Integrity Checks for Brakeman:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the Brakeman executable and configuration before each run (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
    * **Centralized Brakeman Configuration Management:** Manage Brakeman configurations centrally and enforce them across all projects.
    * **Secure Execution Environment:** Run Brakeman in a controlled and isolated environment with limited access.
    * **Regularly Review Brakeman Configuration:** Periodically review the Brakeman configuration to ensure it's aligned with security best practices and covers relevant vulnerability types.

* **Improve CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring and Auditing:**
    * **Comprehensive Logging:**  Log all significant events within the CI/CD pipeline, including configuration changes, user actions, and tool executions.
    * **Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring systems to detect suspicious activities and trigger alerts.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

* **Secure Code Review Practices:**
    * **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require thorough code reviews for all code changes, including those affecting CI/CD configurations.
    * **Automated Security Checks:** Integrate additional security scanning tools beyond Brakeman into the CI/CD pipeline.

* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * **Dependency Scanning:**  Regularly scan dependencies used by the CI/CD pipeline for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Vendor Security Assessments:**  Assess the security practices of third-party vendors providing tools or services for the CI/CD pipeline.

* **Incident Response Plan:**
    * **Develop an incident response plan:**  Outline the steps to take in case of a CI/CD pipeline compromise.
    * **Regularly test the incident response plan:** Conduct simulations to ensure the plan is effective.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path involving the manipulation of Brakeman within the CI/CD pipeline poses a significant risk to application security. By compromising the pipeline, attackers can effectively blind security checks and deploy vulnerable code undetected. A layered security approach is crucial to mitigate this risk, focusing on securing the CI/CD infrastructure itself, ensuring the integrity of security tools like Brakeman, and implementing robust monitoring and auditing mechanisms. Proactive implementation of the recommended mitigation strategies will significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.
