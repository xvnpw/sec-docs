## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Tamper with the application's code during Brakeman's analysis

As a cybersecurity expert collaborating with the development team, this document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path: "Tamper with the application's code during Brakeman's analysis." This analysis will define the objective, scope, and methodology before delving into the specifics of the attack vector.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the feasibility, potential impact, and mitigation strategies associated with an attacker temporarily modifying the application's codebase to evade detection by Brakeman, a static analysis security tool. We aim to:

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Tamper with the application's code during Brakeman's analysis

**Attack Vector:** This requires a sophisticated attacker with significant access and timing control. They would temporarily modify the application's code in a way that masks vulnerabilities from Brakeman during its analysis. After Brakeman completes its scan, the attacker reverts the changes, leaving the vulnerability present in the deployed code.

**4.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Attack:**

1. **Attacker Gains Sufficient Access:** The attacker needs privileged access to the application's codebase and the environment where Brakeman is executed. This could involve:
    * **Compromising developer accounts:** Gaining access to version control systems (e.g., Git), CI/CD pipelines, or developer workstations.
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline:**  Gaining control over the build or deployment process.
    * **Insider threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the codebase.

2. **Identify Brakeman Execution Window:** The attacker needs to understand when Brakeman is executed. This information might be gleaned from:
    * **Observing CI/CD pipeline configurations.**
    * **Monitoring system logs or processes.**
    * **Internal knowledge of development workflows.**

3. **Plan Code Modifications:** The attacker needs to strategically plan the temporary code modifications. These modifications must:
    * **Effectively mask the target vulnerability** from Brakeman's analysis rules. This requires understanding how Brakeman identifies vulnerabilities.
    * **Be easily reversible** without introducing new errors or significantly altering the application's functionality during the brief modification period.
    * **Be subtle enough** not to be immediately obvious during casual observation.

4. **Execute Temporary Code Modification:**  The attacker performs the code modification just before Brakeman's execution. This could involve:
    * **Directly modifying files on the filesystem.**
    * **Using Git commands to temporarily alter the codebase.**
    * **Manipulating environment variables or configuration files that influence code behavior.**

5. **Brakeman Analysis Runs:** Brakeman executes its analysis on the temporarily modified codebase. Since the vulnerability is masked, Brakeman will not report it.

6. **Revert Code Modifications:** Immediately after Brakeman completes its analysis, the attacker reverts the code changes, restoring the vulnerable code. This needs to be done quickly and cleanly to avoid detection or disrupting other processes.

7. **Deployment of Vulnerable Code:** The application is deployed with the original, vulnerable code, as Brakeman did not flag the issue.

8. **Exploitation:** The attacker or another malicious actor can now exploit the vulnerability that was successfully masked from Brakeman.

**4.2 Attacker Capabilities and Requirements:**

* **High Level of Access:** Requires write access to the application's codebase and the environment where Brakeman runs.
* **Deep Understanding of the Application:**  Needs to know where the vulnerability exists and how to temporarily mask it without breaking the application.
* **Knowledge of Brakeman:**  Understanding how Brakeman analyzes code and the types of patterns it looks for is crucial to crafting effective masking modifications.
* **Precise Timing Control:**  The attacker needs to execute the modifications and revert them within a narrow window around Brakeman's execution. This requires automation or very careful manual intervention.
* **Stealth and Opsec:** The attacker needs to perform these actions without triggering alerts or raising suspicion.

**4.3 Potential Impact:**

The impact of this attack can be significant, as it allows vulnerabilities to slip through the static analysis stage and reach production. This could lead to:

* **Security breaches and data leaks:** Exploitable vulnerabilities can be used to compromise the application and its data.
* **Application downtime and instability:** Exploits can cause crashes or denial-of-service.
* **Reputational damage:** Security incidents can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial losses:**  Breaches can lead to fines, legal costs, and loss of business.

**4.4 Detection Challenges:**

Detecting this type of attack is extremely challenging due to its temporary nature:

* **Brakeman's Limitations:** Brakeman analyzes a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time. It has no awareness of temporary modifications.
* **Traditional Security Tools:**  Standard security tools might not detect these fleeting changes unless they are actively monitoring file system modifications or version control activity with very high granularity and real-time alerting.
* **Log Analysis Complexity:** Identifying these temporary changes in logs can be difficult amidst the noise of normal system activity.

**4.5 Mitigation Strategies:**

While directly preventing temporary code modifications during Brakeman's execution is difficult, several strategies can mitigate the risk:

* **Strengthen Access Controls:** Implement robust access control mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, principle of least privilege) to limit who can modify the codebase and the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Enhance CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Secure the CI/CD pipeline itself, as it's a critical point of control. This includes:
    * **Immutable infrastructure:**  Treating infrastructure as code and avoiding manual changes.
    * **Secure secrets management:**  Protecting credentials used in the pipeline.
    * **Integrity checks:**  Verifying the integrity of build artifacts and deployment processes.
* **Code Review Practices:** Implement thorough code review processes, even for seemingly minor changes. This can help catch malicious or suspicious modifications.
* **Real-time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM tools that can detect unauthorized changes to the codebase in real-time. Alerting on unexpected modifications during Brakeman's execution window could indicate an attack.
* **Version Control Auditing:**  Maintain detailed audit logs of all changes made to the version control system. Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.
* **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can detect unusual behavior in the development environment, such as unexpected code modifications or access patterns.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** While not directly preventing the masking, RASP can detect and prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities at runtime, even if they were missed by static analysis.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the development environment and CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
* **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices and the importance of protecting their accounts and development environments.

**4.6 Limitations of Brakeman in this Scenario:**

Brakeman, as a static analysis tool, operates on a snapshot of the codebase. It is inherently limited in its ability to detect attacks that involve temporary modifications. Brakeman cannot:

* **Track changes over time:** It analyzes the code at a specific point, not the evolution of the codebase.
* **Detect transient states:**  Temporary modifications that are reverted before or after the analysis are invisible to Brakeman.
* **Operate in real-time:** Brakeman is typically run as part of a build process, not continuously monitoring the codebase.

**5. Conclusion:**

Tampering with the application's code during Brakeman's analysis is a sophisticated attack requiring significant attacker capabilities and precise timing. While challenging to execute, the potential impact of successfully masking vulnerabilities from static analysis is substantial. Relying solely on Brakeman for security is insufficient against such advanced threats. A layered security approach, incorporating robust access controls, secure CI/CD practices, real-time monitoring, and thorough code reviews, is crucial to mitigate the risk of this attack vector. Understanding the limitations of static analysis tools like Brakeman is essential for building a comprehensive security strategy.
