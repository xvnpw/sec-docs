# Threat Model Analysis for presidentbeef/brakeman

## Threat: [False Negative Vulnerability Detection](./threats/false_negative_vulnerability_detection.md)

*   **Description:** The Brakeman analysis engine fails to identify existing vulnerabilities in the codebase due to limitations in its rules, the complexity of the code, or novel attack patterns. An attacker could then exploit these undetected vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  The application remains vulnerable to exploitation, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** Core analysis engine, vulnerability detectors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Brakeman to the latest version to benefit from new and improved vulnerability detectors.
        *   Combine Brakeman with other static analysis tools, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews for a more comprehensive security assessment.
        *   Stay informed about emerging vulnerabilities and attack techniques to understand potential blind spots in Brakeman's analysis.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Brakeman Reports](./threats/information_disclosure_via_brakeman_reports.md)

*   **Description:** Brakeman reports, if not properly secured, could expose sensitive information present in the codebase, such as API keys, database credentials, internal paths, or configuration details. An attacker gaining access to these reports could leverage this information for further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or configuration details could lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, or the ability to compromise the application's infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** Reporting modules, output generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Brakeman reports in secure locations with appropriate access controls.
        *   Avoid including sensitive information directly in the codebase where possible. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
        *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from Brakeman reports before sharing them.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Brakeman Configuration](./threats/insecure_storage_of_brakeman_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Brakeman configuration files might contain sensitive information, such as API keys for integrations or credentials for accessing external resources. If these configuration files are stored insecurely (e.g., in version control without proper encryption), an attacker could gain access to this information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of configuration credentials could allow attackers to impersonate the application, access external services, or gain unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** Configuration loading, integration modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Brakeman configuration files. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement proper access controls and encryption for Brakeman configuration files.
        *   Do not commit sensitive configuration files to version control systems.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Brakeman Gem](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_brakeman_gem.md)

*   **Description:** If the Brakeman gem or one of its dependencies is compromised, malicious code could be injected into the development environment when the gem is installed or updated. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal credentials, or compromise the application's build process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the development environment, potential for backdoors to be introduced into the application, and theft of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Brakeman Component:** The Brakeman gem itself, dependency management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Brakeman and its dependencies.
        *   Pin specific versions of Brakeman and its dependencies in your project's Gemfile to avoid unexpected updates.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to Brakeman and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using a private gem repository to control the source of gems.
