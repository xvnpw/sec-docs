## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the missed vulnerability in the application (following Brakeman misinterpretation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_missed_vulnerability_in_the_application__following_brakeman_misinterpretation_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker crafts specific code patterns that exploit weaknesses in Brakeman's parsing or analysis logic. This causes Brakeman to incorrectly interpret the code and fail to identify a real security vulnerability. The attacker then exploits this overlooked vulnerability in the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Brakeman's output to hide real vulnerabilities (following dependency exploitation)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_brakeman's_output_to_hide_real_vulnerabilities__following_dependency_exploitation_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Brakeman's dependencies to gain control over the Brakeman process or its output. They then manipulate Brakeman's reporting mechanism to remove or alter warnings about existing vulnerabilities, creating a false sense of security and allowing vulnerable code to be deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the missed vulnerability in the application (following disabling security checks)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_missed_vulnerability_in_the_application__following_disabling_security_checks_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker gains access to the application's codebase and modifies Brakeman's configuration file (`.brakeman.yml`) to disable specific security checks. This prevents Brakeman from identifying vulnerabilities covered by those checks. The attacker then exploits these now-undetected vulnerabilities in the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the missed vulnerability in the application (following excluding code paths)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_missed_vulnerability_in_the_application__following_excluding_code_paths_.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to disabling checks, the attacker modifies Brakeman's configuration to exclude specific code paths from analysis. This prevents Brakeman from scanning potentially vulnerable code, allowing the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities within those excluded sections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the overlooked/unaddressed/known vulnerability in the application (due to workflow issues)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_overlookedunaddressedknown_vulnerability_in_the_application__due_to_workflow_issues_.md)

Attack Vector: This path encompasses several scenarios where human factors lead to vulnerabilities being missed:
        *   **Overwhelmed by false positives:** Developers become desensitized to Brakeman's warnings due to a high volume of false positives and overlook real security issues.
        *   **Lack of understanding:** Developers lack the necessary knowledge to interpret Brakeman's warnings correctly and fail to address real vulnerabilities.
        *   **Prioritization issues:** Security fixes identified by Brakeman are deprioritized in favor of other tasks, leaving known vulnerabilities unpatched and exploitable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the undetected vulnerability in the application (following CI/CD manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_undetected_vulnerability_in_the_application__following_cicd_manipulation_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline where Brakeman is executed. They then modify Brakeman's configuration or execution within the pipeline to prevent it from detecting vulnerabilities before deployment. This results in vulnerable code being deployed without any security warnings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the existing vulnerability in the application (following CI/CD output tampering)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_existing_vulnerability_in_the_application__following_cicd_output_tampering_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline and manipulates Brakeman's output within the pipeline. This creates a false sense of security, leading to the deployment of code that contains existing vulnerabilities, which the attacker can then exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft a specific code pattern that causes Brakeman to misinterpret the code](./attack_tree_paths/craft_a_specific_code_pattern_that_causes_brakeman_to_misinterpret_the_code.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker possesses the skill to reverse-engineer or understand Brakeman's analysis logic and crafts specific code patterns that exploit weaknesses in its parsing or interpretation. This leads to Brakeman silently failing to identify real vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Brakeman's output to hide real vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/modify_brakeman's_output_to_hide_real_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vector: After gaining control of the Brakeman process (e.g., through dependency exploitation), the attacker manipulates the generated security reports to remove or alter warnings about existing vulnerabilities. This creates a false sense of security for the development team.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Brakeman's Configuration Files (.brakeman.yml)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_brakeman's_configuration_files___brakeman_yml_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker gains access to the application's codebase (or the environment where Brakeman is configured) and directly modifies the `.brakeman.yml` file. This allows them to disable crucial security checks or exclude vulnerable code from analysis, effectively bypassing Brakeman's security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with the application's code during Brakeman's analysis](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_the_application's_code_during_brakeman's_analysis.md)

Attack Vector: This requires a sophisticated attacker with significant access and timing control. They would temporarily modify the application's code in a way that masks vulnerabilities from Brakeman during its analysis. After Brakeman completes its scan, the attacker reverts the changes, leaving the vulnerability present in the deployed code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Ignore or Dismiss Brakeman's Findings Inappropriately](./attack_tree_paths/ignore_or_dismiss_brakeman's_findings_inappropriately.md)

Attack Vector: This represents a failure in the development workflow. Developers, for various reasons (false positives, lack of understanding, prioritization), fail to properly address security vulnerabilities identified by Brakeman, leaving them open for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integrate Brakeman into a Vulnerable CI/CD Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/integrate_brakeman_into_a_vulnerable_cicd_pipeline.md)

Attack Vector: The CI/CD pipeline, responsible for building, testing, and deploying the application, has security weaknesses. This allows attackers to compromise the pipeline and subsequently manipulate Brakeman's configuration, execution, or output, leading to the deployment of vulnerable code.
