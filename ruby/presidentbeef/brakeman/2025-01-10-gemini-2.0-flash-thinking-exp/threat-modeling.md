# Threat Model Analysis for presidentbeef/brakeman

## Threat: [Brakeman Code Injection via Malicious Codebase](./threats/brakeman_code_injection_via_malicious_codebase.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with control over parts of the codebase (e.g., through a compromised dependency or contribution) crafts specific Ruby code that, when analyzed by Brakeman's code parsing engine, triggers a vulnerability within Brakeman itself, leading to arbitrary code execution on the machine running Brakeman. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in how Brakeman handles specific syntax or metaprogramming constructs.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the developer's machine or the CI/CD server running Brakeman, allowing the attacker to steal secrets, modify code, or disrupt the development process.
*   **Brakeman Component Affected:**  Code Parsing/Analysis Engine (specifically the Ruby parsing and abstract syntax tree (AST) generation modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Brakeman updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Run Brakeman in isolated environments with limited privileges.
    *   Sanitize or limit the codebase analyzed by Brakeman if external contributions are involved and not fully trusted.
    *   Monitor Brakeman's resource usage for unusual spikes during analysis, which could indicate an exploit attempt.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Brakeman Output](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_brakeman_output.md)

*   **Description:**  Brakeman, during its analysis, might inadvertently include snippets of code containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials embedded in configuration files or code) in its output reports. An attacker gaining access to these reports could then extract this sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of confidential credentials, leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, or other security incidents.
*   **Brakeman Component Affected:**  Reporting/Output Generation (the modules responsible for formatting and presenting the scan results).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
    *   Restrict access to Brakeman output logs and reports to authorized personnel only.
    *   Implement mechanisms to sanitize or redact sensitive information from Brakeman output before sharing or storing it in less secure locations.
    *   Configure Brakeman to exclude specific files or directories known to contain sensitive configuration data.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Brakeman Configuration for Bypassing Checks](./threats/manipulation_of_brakeman_configuration_for_bypassing_checks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Brakeman configuration file (.brakeman.yml) could modify it to disable critical security checks, exclude vulnerable code paths from analysis, or suppress relevant warnings, effectively weakening the security analysis performed by Brakeman.
*   **Impact:**  Failure to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, leading to the deployment of insecure code.
*   **Brakeman Component Affected:**  Configuration Parsing/Loading (the module responsible for reading and interpreting the .brakeman.yml file).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Brakeman configuration file with appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Store the Brakeman configuration file in version control and track changes.
    *   Implement code review processes for changes to the Brakeman configuration.
    *   Enforce a standardized and security-focused Brakeman configuration across projects.

## Threat: [Reliance on Outdated or Vulnerable Brakeman Version](./threats/reliance_on_outdated_or_vulnerable_brakeman_version.md)

*   **Description:**  Using an outdated version of Brakeman that contains known security vulnerabilities could expose the development environment to attacks targeting those vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the development environment or CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Brakeman Component Affected:**  The entire Brakeman application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Brakeman to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor Brakeman's release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement automated checks to ensure the correct Brakeman version is being used.
