## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Introduce False Negatives [HIGH RISK PATH]

This analysis focuses on the attack path "Introduce False Negatives" within the context of using Brakeman for static analysis of a Ruby on Rails application. This path represents a particularly insidious and dangerous type of attack, as its success directly undermines the security assurance provided by Brakeman.

**Understanding the Goal:**

The ultimate goal of an attacker following this path is to inject vulnerabilities into the application's codebase in a way that Brakeman, despite its capabilities, fails to detect them. This creates a **false negative**: the tool reports the code as safe, but it actually contains exploitable flaws. This is a high-risk scenario because it leads to a false sense of security, potentially delaying or preventing the discovery and remediation of critical vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Tree Path:**

**1. Introduce False Negatives [HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** This is the overarching objective. The attacker aims to successfully embed vulnerabilities that Brakeman will not flag.
* **Risk Level:** **HIGH**. A successful attack on this path directly compromises the security posture of the application. It allows vulnerabilities to slip into production, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other severe consequences.
* **Attacker Motivation:**
    * **Subversion:**  Intentionally weaken the application's security.
    * **Long-term Access:** Introduce vulnerabilities for later exploitation.
    * **Bypass Security Controls:** Circumvent the intended security checks provided by Brakeman.
    * **Malicious Insider Threat:** A disgruntled developer or someone with access to the codebase could intentionally introduce these vulnerabilities.

**2. Craft Code That Appears Safe But Is Vulnerable [HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** This is the primary tactic used to achieve the goal of introducing false negatives. The attacker focuses on writing code that exploits the limitations of static analysis tools like Brakeman. This involves crafting code that looks semantically correct and follows common patterns, but contains subtle vulnerabilities that are difficult for automated tools to identify.
* **Risk Level:** **HIGH**. This is the core action that enables the false negative. Successful execution directly leads to exploitable vulnerabilities in the codebase.
* **Techniques and Examples:**  This is where the attacker's creativity and understanding of Brakeman's analysis techniques come into play. Here are several ways an attacker might craft such code:

    * **Obfuscation and Indirection:**
        * **Dynamic Method Calls:**  Instead of directly calling a vulnerable method, the attacker might use `send` or `public_send` with dynamically constructed method names. Brakeman might not be able to statically determine the target method.
            ```ruby
            # Vulnerable to SQL injection
            def search(term)
              table_name = params[:table] # Potentially user-controlled
              column_name = "name"
              query = "SELECT * FROM #{table_name} WHERE #{column_name} LIKE '%#{term}%'"
              ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(query)
            end
            ```
            Brakeman might flag this, but if `table_name` and `column_name` are constructed through more complex logic or retrieved from external sources, it becomes harder to detect.

        * **String Interpolation with Complex Logic:** Embedding vulnerable strings within more complex string manipulations can make detection difficult.
            ```ruby
            user_input = params[:name]
            prefix = "Welcome, "
            suffix = "!"
            greeting = "#{prefix}#{user_input}#{suffix}" # Potential XSS if not properly escaped
            ```
            While Brakeman is good at identifying basic XSS, more intricate string manipulation might bypass its analysis.

        * **Using `eval` or `instance_eval` with User Input:** This is generally flagged by Brakeman, but attackers might try to obfuscate the source of the user input or the context of the evaluation.

    * **Exploiting Framework-Specific Quirks and Assumptions:**
        * **Indirect Parameter Passing:** Passing vulnerable data through multiple layers of method calls or object attributes can make the data flow harder to track statically.
        ```ruby
        class UserData
          attr_accessor :unsafe_input
        end

        def process_data(data_object)
          # ... some processing ...
          User.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '#{data_object.unsafe_input}'")
        end

        def controller_action
          data = UserData.new
          data.unsafe_input = params[:name]
          process_data(data)
        end
        ```
        Brakeman might miss the connection between the user input in the controller and the SQL injection in `process_data` if the analysis doesn't track the `UserData` object effectively.

        * **Leveraging Default Framework Behaviors:**  Attackers might exploit default settings or behaviors of Rails that can lead to vulnerabilities if not explicitly addressed. For example, relying on default serialization methods without proper sanitization.

    * **Introducing Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerabilities:** While not strictly a false negative in the sense of a missed vulnerability, attackers might introduce logic where a security check is performed, but the state of the application changes before the checked value is used, leading to a vulnerability. This is harder for static analysis to detect as it involves timing and state changes.

    * **Exploiting Limitations in Brakeman's Analysis:**
        * **Focusing on Specific Vulnerability Types:** Brakeman excels at identifying certain vulnerability types. Attackers might focus on less commonly checked or more complex vulnerabilities.
        * **Using Language Features that are Hard to Analyze:**  While Ruby is generally well-suited for static analysis, certain dynamic features can pose challenges.

    * **Introducing Logical Flaws:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect logic or business rules are often harder for static analysis to detect than syntax errors or direct use of vulnerable functions.

**Impact and Risk:**

The successful execution of this attack path has severe consequences:

* **Compromised Security Posture:**  The application is vulnerable, but the security team might be unaware due to the false negative.
* **Delayed Vulnerability Discovery:**  The vulnerability might remain undetected until exploited in a production environment.
* **Potential Data Breach or System Compromise:**  The introduced vulnerability could be exploited to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.
* **Erosion of Trust:**  If Brakeman is perceived as unreliable due to false negatives, the development team might lose confidence in its effectiveness.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

While it's impossible to eliminate all false negatives, several strategies can significantly reduce the risk:

* **Code Reviews:**  Manual code reviews by experienced security engineers are crucial for identifying subtle vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite can test the running application for vulnerabilities, complementing static analysis.
* **Security Training for Developers:** Educating developers on common vulnerability patterns and how to write secure code is essential.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Regular penetration testing by external security experts can uncover vulnerabilities that slipped through other security measures.
* **Stay Updated with Brakeman:** Ensure Brakeman is updated to the latest version to benefit from new vulnerability checks and improved analysis capabilities.
* **Custom Brakeman Checks:**  Consider writing custom Brakeman checks for specific application logic or known vulnerabilities.
* **Combine Static and Dynamic Analysis:**  Integrate Brakeman into the CI/CD pipeline and use it in conjunction with DAST tools for a more comprehensive security assessment.
* **Threat Modeling:**  Proactively identify potential attack vectors and design defenses accordingly.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding principles, such as input validation, output encoding, and least privilege.

**Conclusion:**

The "Introduce False Negatives" attack path highlights the inherent limitations of static analysis tools. While Brakeman is a valuable tool for identifying vulnerabilities, it's not a silver bullet. Attackers can intentionally craft code that appears safe but is vulnerable, exploiting the nuances of the Ruby language and the complexities of application logic. A layered security approach, combining static analysis with other security measures like code reviews, dynamic testing, and developer training, is crucial for mitigating the risks associated with this high-risk attack path. Understanding how attackers might attempt to introduce false negatives empowers development teams to write more resilient code and improve their overall security posture.
