**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via FPM Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application or its environment by exploiting vulnerabilities related to FPM usage.

*   **Exploit FPM Input Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the data provided to FPM during the packaging process. Attackers aim to inject malicious content or influence the packaging process in unintended ways by exploiting how the application handles input destined for FPM.

*   **Inject Malicious Code via Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   FPM allows specifying scripts and configurations. If the application doesn't sanitize input used to generate these configurations, an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed during the packaging or installation process.

*   **Leverage Unsanitized Input in FPM Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   If user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is directly used to populate fields like `before_install`, `after_install`, `deb_pre_install`, etc., without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Inject Shell Commands into 'before_install', 'after_install', etc. scripts (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   By injecting malicious shell commands into the script fields of the FPM configuration, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system where the package is being built or installed. For example, providing a value like `; rm -rf /` in a `before_install` script could have devastating consequences.

*   **Path Traversal during Package Definition:**
    *   When defining the files and directories to be included in the package, FPM relies on the provided paths. If the application doesn't properly validate these paths, an attacker can use path traversal techniques to include sensitive files or overwrite system files.

*   **Specify Malicious Paths in Source Files or Directories:**
    *   By manipulating the input provided to FPM regarding which files and directories to package, an attacker can include files they shouldn't have access to or overwrite existing system files during installation if the package is deployed with elevated privileges.

*   **Include Sensitive Files or Overwrite System Files in the Package (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   By using path traversal techniques, an attacker can force FPM to include sensitive files from outside the intended application directory in the generated package. Alternatively, they could overwrite critical system files if the package is installed with sufficient privileges.

*   **Supply Malicious Source Files:**
    *   If the application allows users to upload or provide source files that are then packaged using FPM, an attacker can include backdoors or exploits within these files.

*   **Include Backdoors or Exploits in Files Packaged by FPM:**
    *   The attacker embeds malicious code within seemingly legitimate files that are then packaged by FPM.

*   **Execute Malicious Code Upon Package Installation (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   When the package containing the malicious code is installed on the target system, the embedded backdoor or exploit is executed, potentially granting the attacker control over the system.

*   **Exploit FPM Execution Environment (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This category of attacks focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how FPM executes commands internally. If the application doesn't properly sanitize inputs that are used to build these commands, it could be vulnerable to command injection.

*   **Leverage Insecure Command Construction (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   FPM internally constructs commands to perform packaging tasks. If the application using FPM doesn't properly sanitize inputs that are used to build these commands, it could be vulnerable to command injection.

*   **FPM Constructs Commands Vulnerable to Injection:**
    *   If filenames, package names, or other metadata are taken from untrusted sources and directly incorporated into commands executed by FPM without proper escaping or quoting, an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Inject Shell Commands via Filenames or Package Metadata (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   By crafting malicious filenames or manipulating package metadata that is used in commands executed by FPM, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands, leading to code execution on the system where FPM is running. For example, a malicious filename like `package; rm -rf /` could be used.
