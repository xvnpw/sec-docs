# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Threat: [Compromised Database Credentials](./threats/compromised_database_credentials.md)

**Threat:** Compromised Database Credentials

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the database credentials used *by pghero*. This could happen if these credentials are insecurely stored *within pghero's configuration* or on the server where pghero is running. Once obtained, the attacker can directly connect to the database.

**Impact:** The attacker can perform any action the compromised database user is authorized to do. This could include reading sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, creating new users with administrative privileges, or even dropping entire databases, leading to significant data loss, corruption, and service disruption.

**Affected pghero Component:** Database Connection Logic (the part of pghero that stores and uses the database credentials).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure pghero to retrieve database credentials from secure environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, rather than storing them directly in configuration files.
*   Restrict access to the server and configuration files where pghero is deployed.
*   Regularly rotate database credentials used by pghero.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Database Information via pghero Interface](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_database_information_via_pghero_interface.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Database Information via pghero Interface

**Description:** An unauthorized user gains access to the *pghero web interface* (if enabled) or its data endpoints. This could occur due to weak or missing authentication *on the pghero interface itself*, misconfigured access controls *for the pghero application*, or vulnerabilities in the pghero interface. The attacker can then view sensitive database metrics, query statistics, and potentially even snippets of queries *displayed by pghero*.

**Impact:** The attacker can gain insights into the database schema, data volumes, query patterns, and potential performance bottlenecks. This information can be used for further attacks, such as crafting targeted SQL injection attacks, understanding business logic, or identifying sensitive data for exfiltration.

**Affected pghero Component:** Web Interface (the component of pghero that presents the monitoring data), Data Retrieval Modules (the parts of pghero that fetch and format database information for display).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization *directly on the pghero web interface*.
*   Restrict network access to the pghero interface to authorized personnel and internal networks.
*   Use HTTPS to encrypt communication with the pghero interface.
*   Regularly review and audit access controls for the pghero interface.
*   Consider disabling the web interface if it's not actively needed and rely on programmatic access if necessary.

## Threat: [Excessive Database Permissions for pghero User](./threats/excessive_database_permissions_for_pghero_user.md)

**Threat:** Excessive Database Permissions for pghero User

**Description:** The database user configured *for pghero* has more privileges than necessary for its monitoring tasks. If this account is compromised (as described in the "Compromised Database Credentials" threat), the attacker can perform actions beyond simply reading monitoring data *through the compromised pghero connection*.

**Impact:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data, alter the database schema, or perform other administrative tasks, leading to data integrity issues, data loss, or service disruption.

**Affected pghero Component:** Database Connection Logic (the configuration that defines the database user used by pghero), potentially all modules that execute queries against the database *using pghero's connection*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring the database user *specifically for pghero*. Grant only the necessary permissions for monitoring tasks (e.g., `SELECT` on relevant tables and views).
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the pghero database user.
*   Consider using a dedicated read-only user *for pghero* if possible.
