## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pghero -> Exploit pghero's Database Connection -> Obtain pghero's Database Credentials -> Access Stored Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pghero_-_exploit_pghero's_database_connection_-_obtain_pghero's_databas_1d99f67e.md)

This path represents the common scenario where attackers focus on finding the database credentials used by pghero. The attack vectors involve gaining access to configuration files or exploiting insecure storage practices. The likelihood is driven by the frequency of such misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pghero -> Exploit pghero's Database Connection -> Obtain pghero's Database Credentials -> Access Stored Credentials -> Exploit insecure storage of credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pghero_-_exploit_pghero's_database_connection_-_obtain_pghero's_databas_a76c0d54.md)

A specific instance of the above path, emphasizing the exploitation of plain text or weakly protected credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pghero -> Exploit pghero's Database Connection -> Leverage Compromised Credentials -> Direct Database Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pghero_-_exploit_pghero's_database_connection_-_leverage_compromised_cr_d1efe6cc.md)

This path illustrates the immediate consequence of obtaining valid database credentials – the ability to directly interact with the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pghero -> Exploit pghero's Database Connection -> Leverage Compromised Credentials -> Direct Database Access -> Read Sensitive Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pghero_-_exploit_pghero's_database_connection_-_leverage_compromised_cr_ccdaa48d.md)

This path represents the ultimate goal for many attackers – gaining access to sensitive data. It highlights the direct chain of events from compromising the pghero connection to exfiltrating valuable information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pghero -> Exploit pghero's Database Connection -> Leverage Compromised Credentials -> Direct Database Access -> Modify Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pghero_-_exploit_pghero's_database_connection_-_leverage_compromised_cr_9f2d3f76.md)

This path focuses on the risk of data integrity compromise. Attackers, after gaining database access, can maliciously alter application data.
