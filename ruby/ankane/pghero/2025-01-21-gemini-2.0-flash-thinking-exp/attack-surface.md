# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Database Monitoring Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_database_monitoring_data.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access to PgHero's dashboard reveals internal database performance metrics, query statistics, and potentially sensitive information about application usage and data structures.

**How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero's core functionality is to collect and display this data through a web interface.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the PgHero dashboard and observes frequently executed queries that reveal sensitive customer data or business logic.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for targeted attacks based on revealed insights, understanding of database schema and vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for the PgHero dashboard (e.g., using application-level authentication, HTTP Basic Auth, or a dedicated authentication service).
* Restrict access to the PgHero dashboard to only authorized personnel and networks.
* Consider running PgHero on an internal network, not directly exposed to the internet.
* Regularly review access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Database Credentials Exposure](./attack_surfaces/database_credentials_exposure.md)

**Description:**  Database credentials used by PgHero to connect to the PostgreSQL instance are exposed or compromised.

**How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero requires database credentials to function. If these are not securely managed, they become a point of vulnerability.

**Example:** Database credentials for PgHero are hardcoded in the application's configuration files or stored in insecure environment variables. An attacker gains access to the codebase or server and retrieves these credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store database credentials securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or configuration files.
* Ensure proper file system permissions to prevent unauthorized access to configuration files.
* Regularly rotate database credentials.
* Use a dedicated, least-privileged database user for PgHero with only the necessary permissions for monitoring.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in PgHero Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_pghero_interface.md)

**Description:**  PgHero's web interface does not properly sanitize data retrieved from the database, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of users accessing the dashboard.

**How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero displays data fetched from the database. If this data includes malicious scripts and is not properly escaped, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** A malicious actor injects a crafted SQL query that inserts JavaScript code into a database field. When PgHero displays this data, the script executes in the administrator's browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account compromise of users accessing the PgHero dashboard, potential for further attacks against the application or infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure PgHero (or the underlying framework it uses) properly sanitizes and escapes all user-controlled data before rendering it in the web interface.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
* Regularly update PgHero to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** PgHero relies on other Ruby gems (dependencies) that may contain known security vulnerabilities.

**How PgHero Contributes:** By including these dependencies, PgHero inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of a gem that PgHero depends on. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise the application or the server running PgHero.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update PgHero and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
* Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for PgHero and its dependencies.
