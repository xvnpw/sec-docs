Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats directly involving PgHero:

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server or application's configuration files (e.g., `.env`, application configuration files) where PgHero's database connection details (username, password, host, port, database name) are stored. They then use these credentials to directly access the PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, and application downtime.
    *   **Affected PgHero Component:** Configuration loading mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store database credentials securely using environment variables managed by a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or code.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions on configuration files to restrict access.
        *   Encrypt configuration files at rest.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to PgHero Interface
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the PgHero web interface, either due to a lack of authentication, weak authentication, or an authorization bypass vulnerability *within PgHero itself*. They can then view sensitive database performance metrics, query statistics, and potentially query examples.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive database information, including query patterns, table structures, and performance characteristics, which could aid in planning further attacks or understanding business logic.
    *   **Affected PgHero Component:** Web interface, authentication/authorization handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication for the PgHero interface (e.g., username/password with strong password requirements, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Utilize the `Rack::Auth::Basic` middleware or a more robust authentication solution provided by your web framework.
        *   Restrict access to the PgHero interface to authorized users or IP addresses using network firewalls or access control lists.
        *   Regularly review and update authentication and authorization mechanisms.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** PgHero relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the PgHero application.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the server hosting PgHero.
    *   **Affected PgHero Component:** Dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update PgHero and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to identify and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Review the security advisories for the dependencies used by PgHero.

*   **Threat:** Running PgHero in a Publicly Accessible Environment without Proper Security
    *   **Description:** Deploying the PgHero interface directly on the public internet without proper security measures (like strong authentication *on PgHero*, network firewalls, and intrusion detection systems) significantly increases the attack surface and the likelihood of exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of all the aforementioned threats, as attackers from anywhere can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or access sensitive information.
    *   **Affected PgHero Component:** Deployment environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Deploy PgHero in a private network segment, accessible only through a VPN or a secure gateway.
        *   Use network firewalls to restrict access to the PgHero interface to authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for and block malicious activity.
