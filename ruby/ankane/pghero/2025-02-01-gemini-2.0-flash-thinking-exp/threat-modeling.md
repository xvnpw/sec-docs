# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials
*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to configuration files, environment variables, or application code where database credentials for pghero are stored. This could be achieved through server compromise, misconfiguration, or insider threat. Once credentials are obtained, the attacker can directly connect to the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, or denial of service by overloading the database.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Configuration files, environment variables, application deployment scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to store database credentials instead of hardcoding them in configuration files or code.
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure configuration files are not world-readable and are only accessible by the pghero application user and administrators.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the pghero database user only the necessary permissions required for monitoring and avoid granting excessive privileges.

## Threat: [Disclosure of Sensitive Database Information through Pghero UI](./threats/disclosure_of_sensitive_database_information_through_pghero_ui.md)

*   **Threat:** Disclosure of Sensitive Database Information through Pghero UI
*   **Description:** An attacker, either unauthorized external user or malicious insider, gains access to the pghero web interface. Through the UI, they can observe database metrics, query statistics, and potentially query examples, revealing sensitive information about database schema, performance, and data access patterns.
*   **Impact:** Information leakage about database structure, performance characteristics, and potentially sensitive data accessed by queries. This can aid further attacks or expose confidential business information.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Pghero Web UI (dashboard, query pages, metrics views).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication for the pghero web interface. Use robust password policies, multi-factor authentication, or integrate with existing identity providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML).
    *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** If possible, implement RBAC to restrict access to specific pghero features and data based on user roles.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of UI Access:** Review user access to the pghero UI and ensure it aligns with the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Authentication for Pghero UI](./threats/weak_or_missing_authentication_for_pghero_ui.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak or Missing Authentication for Pghero UI
*   **Description:**  If pghero's web interface lacks proper authentication or uses weak default credentials, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the monitoring dashboard. This could be due to misconfiguration of pghero itself or the reverse proxy/web server protecting it.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to database monitoring data, potentially leading to information disclosure and further attacks.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Pghero Web UI, Authentication mechanisms (or lack thereof).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the pghero UI.
    *   **Regularly Test Authentication:** Perform penetration testing or security audits to verify the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Ensure any default accounts or weak default credentials are disabled or changed immediately upon deployment.
    *   **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and the pghero application, protecting authentication credentials in transit.

## Threat: [Exposure of Pghero Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_pghero_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Pghero Configuration Files
*   **Description:** If pghero configuration files, containing database credentials or sensitive settings, are not properly protected, an attacker gaining access to the server or repository where these files are stored can read them and extract sensitive information. This could be due to misconfigured web servers, insecure file permissions, or accidental exposure in version control.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of database credentials and other sensitive configuration details, leading to potential unauthorized access and further attacks.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Pghero configuration files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure configuration files are not world-readable and are only accessible by the pghero application user and administrators.
    *   **Secure Configuration File Storage:** Store configuration files in secure locations and avoid committing sensitive configuration files directly to version control systems.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration of Pghero UI Access](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_of_pghero_ui_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration of Pghero UI Access
*   **Description:** Pghero might have insecure default configurations related to UI access, such as lacking authentication enabled by default or having overly permissive access controls out-of-the-box. If these defaults are not changed during deployment, it can lead to unauthorized access to the monitoring dashboard.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to unauthorized access and information disclosure through the Pghero UI.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Pghero default UI access configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden Default Configuration:** Thoroughly review pghero's default UI access configuration and ensure strong authentication and authorization are enabled and properly configured during deployment.
    *   **Follow Security Hardening Guides:** Consult pghero documentation and security hardening guides for recommended secure UI access configuration.

## Threat: [Critical Vulnerabilities in Pghero Dependencies](./threats/critical_vulnerabilities_in_pghero_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Critical Vulnerabilities in Pghero Dependencies
*   **Description:** Pghero relies on external libraries and frameworks. If these dependencies contain critical security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to severely compromise the pghero application or the server it runs on. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or complete system takeover.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the pghero application and potentially the underlying server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system control by the attacker.
*   **Affected Pghero Component:** Pghero dependencies (libraries, frameworks).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Monitoring:** Regularly scan pghero's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools and continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Timely Dependency Updates:**  Keep pghero's dependencies updated to the latest versions, prioritizing patching critical vulnerabilities as soon as updates are available.
    *   **Automated Dependency Management:** Implement automated dependency management and update processes to ensure timely patching and reduce manual effort.
