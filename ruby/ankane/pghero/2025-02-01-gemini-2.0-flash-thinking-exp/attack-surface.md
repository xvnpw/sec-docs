# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient or easily bypassed mechanisms to verify user identity and control access to pghero's web interface.
*   **pghero contribution:** pghero might rely on basic authentication or have default, weak credentials if not properly configured by the user. Lack of robust role-based access control could also lead to unauthorized access to sensitive monitoring data.
*   **Example:** Default pghero installation uses a predictable username/password combination, or relies solely on HTTP Basic Auth without enforced strong passwords or multi-factor authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to pghero's web interface, allowing attackers to view sensitive database performance data and potentially manipulate monitoring settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong authentication:** Enforce strong passwords, consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) if possible, and avoid default credentials.
    *   **Utilize HTTPS:** Encrypt communication between the user's browser and pghero to protect credentials in transit.
    *   **Implement robust authorization:** If pghero offers user roles or permissions, configure them to follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only necessary access.
    *   **Regularly audit user accounts:** Review and remove unnecessary or inactive user accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **pghero contribution:** If pghero's web interface doesn't properly sanitize data retrieved from the database (e.g., query results, database names) or user inputs before displaying it, it can become vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example:** pghero displays a database name that an attacker has maliciously modified to include JavaScript code. When a user views the pghero dashboard, the script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of the pghero interface, redirection to malicious sites, information theft from the user's browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input sanitization and output encoding:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data and data retrieved from the database before displaying it in the web interface.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular security scanning:** Use automated tools to scan pghero's web interface for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional exposure of sensitive information through the web interface, error messages, or debug logs.
*   **pghero contribution:** pghero's web interface might inadvertently reveal database connection strings, internal paths, software versions, or configuration details in error messages, debug pages, or even in the HTML source code.
*   **Example:** An error message in pghero's web interface displays the full database connection string, including the password. Or, debug mode is left enabled in production, exposing internal application details.
*   **Impact:** Reconnaissance for attackers, potential exposure of database credentials, aiding in further attacks by revealing system architecture and vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable debug mode in production:** Ensure debug mode is disabled in production environments to prevent verbose error messages and information leaks.
    *   **Implement custom error pages:** Use generic error pages that do not reveal sensitive technical details.
    *   **Secure logging practices:** Avoid logging sensitive information like database credentials in application logs.
    *   **Regular security audits:** Review the web interface and application logs for potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Database Credentials Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_database_credentials_management.md)

*   **Description:** Storing database credentials used by pghero in an insecure manner, making them easily accessible to attackers.
*   **pghero contribution:** pghero needs to store credentials to connect to PostgreSQL databases. If these are stored in plain text configuration files, easily accessible locations, or with weak encryption, it creates a significant vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Database credentials for pghero are stored in plain text in a configuration file readable by the web server user, or are hardcoded in the application code.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the monitored PostgreSQL databases, allowing attackers to steal, modify, or delete data, and disrupt database operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment variables:** Store database credentials as environment variables, which are generally more secure than configuration files.
    *   **Secrets management systems:** Utilize dedicated secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to securely store and retrieve database credentials.
    *   **File system permissions:** Restrict file system permissions on configuration files containing credentials to only the necessary users and processes.
    *   **Encryption at rest:** If storing credentials in files, encrypt them at rest using strong encryption algorithms.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Database Permissions for pghero User](./attack_surfaces/excessive_database_permissions_for_pghero_user.md)

*   **Description:** Granting the PostgreSQL user used by pghero more privileges than necessary for its monitoring functions.
*   **pghero contribution:** If the pghero setup guide or default configurations recommend or lead to granting overly permissive database roles to the pghero user, it increases the potential damage from a pghero compromise.
*   **Example:** The pghero user is granted `SUPERUSER` or `pg_read_all_data` roles, allowing it to access and modify any data in the database.
*   **Impact:** If pghero is compromised, attackers can leverage the database connection to perform actions beyond monitoring, including data modification, deletion, or even database takeover, depending on the excessive privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of least privilege:** Grant the pghero database user only the minimum necessary privileges required for monitoring (e.g., `pg_monitor` role in newer PostgreSQL versions, or specific `SELECT` permissions on relevant system tables and views in older versions).
    *   **Regularly review database user permissions:** Periodically audit the permissions granted to the pghero database user and ensure they are still appropriate and minimal.
    *   **Database firewalling:** Implement database firewall rules to restrict connections to the PostgreSQL server to only the pghero application server and authorized administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Using third-party libraries (gems in Ruby context for pghero) with known security vulnerabilities.
*   **pghero contribution:** As a Ruby on Rails application, pghero relies on numerous gems. Outdated or unpatched gems can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise pghero.
*   **Example:** pghero uses an outdated version of a gem with a known remote code execution vulnerability. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the pghero server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency scanning:** Regularly scan pghero's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit` or other dependency vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Keep dependencies updated:** Keep pghero's dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions. Implement a regular dependency update process.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate SCA tools into the development and deployment pipeline to continuously monitor and manage dependencies.
