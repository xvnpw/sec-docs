## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit pghero Web Interface Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_pghero_web_interface_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the pghero web interface to gain unauthorized access. This is a high-risk path because it directly targets the entry point to monitoring data and potentially database access.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** The web interface is the primary interaction point with pghero, making it a critical node for attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Unauthenticated Access to pghero Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__unauthenticated_access_to_pghero_interface__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the pghero interface without any authentication. This is a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability if not properly configured.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:**  Unauthenticated access is a fundamental security flaw, granting immediate access to potentially sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. pghero Deployed without Authentication [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__pghero_deployed_without_authentication__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The root cause of unauthenticated access. If pghero is deployed without enabling or configuring authentication, it's directly accessible.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** This is the configuration flaw that directly enables the high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Network Access to pghero Interface [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__network_access_to_pghero_interface__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Making the pghero interface accessible over a network (especially a public network) without proper access controls. This is a prerequisite for exploiting unauthenticated access.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Network accessibility is a necessary condition for remote exploitation of web interface vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit pghero Database Connection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_pghero_database_connection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the database connection used by pghero, primarily by stealing the database credentials. This is a high-risk path because it bypasses pghero and grants direct database access.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:**  Database connection security is paramount, and vulnerabilities here directly lead to the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Credential Theft for pghero Database User [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__credential_theft_for_pghero_database_user__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Stealing the database credentials used by pghero to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Successful credential theft allows direct database access.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Credential theft is a direct and high-impact attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Access to Configuration Files with Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__access_to_configuration_files_with_credentials__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining database credentials from configuration files where they are stored.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Configuration files are a common place to store credentials, making them a prime target.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Misconfigured File Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__misconfigured_file_permissions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Configuration files containing credentials have overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read them.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Misconfigured permissions directly enable unauthorized access to sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.2. Unencrypted Configuration Storage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_2__unencrypted_configuration_storage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Storing database credentials in configuration files in plain text or easily reversible encryption, making them readily accessible if the files are compromised.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Unencrypted storage negates any file access controls if the files are accessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Access to Environment Variables with Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__access_to_environment_variables_with_credentials__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining database credentials from environment variables where they are stored.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Environment variables are another common place to store credentials, and can be vulnerable if exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1. Exposed Environment Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1__exposed_environment_variables__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Environment variables containing credentials are exposed through logs, process lists, or other means, allowing attackers to retrieve them.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Exposure of environment variables directly leads to credential theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.2. Insecure Container/Server Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_2__insecure_containerserver_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Insecure configuration of containers or servers allows access to environment variables, such as through container breakouts or server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Insecure configurations enable the exposure of environment variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit pghero Configuration/Deployment Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_pghero_configurationdeployment_issues__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting general misconfigurations and deployment issues related to pghero and its environment. This is a broader high-risk path encompassing various configuration weaknesses.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Configuration and deployment are fundamental to security, and issues here can create multiple attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Vulnerabilities in pghero Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__vulnerabilities_in_pghero_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in pghero's dependencies (Rails, gems, etc.). Outdated and vulnerable dependencies are a common attack vector.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Dependency vulnerabilities are a well-known and frequently exploited attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__outdated_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Outdated dependencies are the direct cause of dependency vulnerability risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.3. Misconfiguration during pghero Deployment [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_3__misconfiguration_during_pghero_deployment__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** General misconfigurations during the deployment process that introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Deployment misconfigurations are a common source of security weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.3.1. Exposing pghero Interface to Public Network Unnecessarily [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_3_1__exposing_pghero_interface_to_public_network_unnecessarily__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Making the pghero web interface accessible to the public internet when it's not necessary, increasing the attack surface and likelihood of exploitation.
*   **Critical Node Rationale:** Public exposure unnecessarily increases risk and is a common deployment misconfiguration.
