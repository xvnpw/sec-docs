# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store Database Credentials for pghero](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_database_credentials_for_pghero.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Store Database Credentials *for pghero* using Environment Variables and Secrets Management.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all locations** where database credentials *for pghero* are currently stored (e.g., pghero configuration files, application code).
    2.  **Remove hardcoded credentials** from all files and code *related to pghero configuration*.
    3.  **Set database connection details as environment variables** on the server or environment where *pghero* is deployed. Use environment variables specifically read by pghero, such as `PGHERO_DATABASE_URL`, `PGHERO_USERNAME`, `PGHERO_PASSWORD`, `PGHERO_HOST`, `PGHERO_PORT`.
    4.  **Optionally, for enhanced security, use a secrets management system:**
        *   **Configure a secrets management system** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store the database credentials *used by pghero*.
        *   **Modify the pghero application configuration** to retrieve credentials from the secrets management system instead of directly from environment variables. This might require code changes within the application to integrate with the chosen secrets manager.
        *   **Ensure proper authentication and authorization** for the *pghero application* to access the secrets management system.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure (High Severity):**  If credentials *for pghero* are hardcoded and the codebase or configuration files are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to the PostgreSQL database *via the pghero user*.
    *   **Accidental Credential Leakage (Medium Severity):** Hardcoded credentials *for pghero* can be accidentally exposed through logs, commit history, or configuration backups.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure:** High risk reduction. Eliminates the primary vulnerability of directly exposed credentials *used by pghero*.
    *   **Accidental Credential Leakage:** Medium risk reduction. Environment variables are less likely to be accidentally committed than hardcoded values. Secrets management further reduces this risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Partially implemented. Database connection details *for pghero* are currently read from environment variables in production.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Secrets Management:** Missing in all environments. Consider implementing secrets management for production and staging for enhanced security of *pghero's database credentials*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for pghero Database User](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_pghero_database_user.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Principle of Least Privilege for *the dedicated pghero* Database User.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Connect to the PostgreSQL database** as a superuser or a user with sufficient privileges.
    2.  **Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user specifically for pghero.** Choose a descriptive username, e.g., `pghero_monitor`.
    3.  **Revoke all default privileges** from this newly created *pghero* user.
    4.  **Grant `CONNECT` privilege** to the databases that *pghero* needs to monitor.
    5.  **Grant `SELECT` privileges** *only* on the specific PostgreSQL system tables and views *required by pghero*.  Refer to pghero documentation or source code to identify the necessary tables and views (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_locks`, etc.).
    6.  **Do not grant any `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `DDL` privileges** to the *pghero_monitor user*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection via pghero (Low Severity):** Limiting privileges minimizes potential damage if a vulnerability in *pghero* were to be exploited for SQL injection, even though pghero is designed for read-only operations.
    *   **Accidental or Malicious Data Modification (Medium Severity):**  Restricting privileges prevents accidental or malicious modification or deletion of database data through *the pghero user account* if it were compromised.
    *   **Lateral Movement after pghero Compromise (Medium Severity):**  Limiting privileges restricts an attacker's ability to escalate privileges or move laterally within the database system if *pghero or its credentials* are compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection via pghero:** Low risk reduction. Defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Accidental or Malicious Data Modification:** Medium risk reduction. Significantly reduces potential data integrity issues.
    *   **Lateral Movement after pghero Compromise:** Medium risk reduction. Limits attacker capabilities within the database.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. A dedicated `pghero` user exists, but specific privileges granted have not been strictly limited to the minimum required *for pghero*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Privilege Review and Restriction:** Missing in all environments. Need to audit and restrict the privileges of the `pghero` user to the absolute minimum required *for its monitoring functions*.

    2.  **Integrate the chosen authentication gem** into the *pghero application*.
    3.  **Implement user registration and login functionality** *within pghero*.
    4.  **Protect the pghero dashboard routes** by requiring authentication. Use authentication filters to ensure only authenticated users can access *the pghero dashboard*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Performance Metrics:** High risk reduction. Authentication is the primary control to prevent unauthorized *pghero dashboard* access.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High risk reduction. Limits information disclosure by controlling access to *the pghero dashboard*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. The *pghero dashboard* is currently accessible without any authentication.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Authentication Implementation:** Missing in all environments. Requires development effort to integrate authentication into *the pghero application*.

        *   **Investigate if pghero allows for disabling or customizing metric collection.** Check *pghero configuration options or code*.
        *   **If customization within pghero is limited, consider the risk-benefit trade-off.**
        *   **If risks are too high, consider alternative monitoring solutions** if *pghero's metric exposure* is a critical issue.
    4.  **Document the rationale for metrics exposed or limited by pghero.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Metrics (Medium Severity):**  *Pghero* exposing overly detailed metrics could reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Competitive Intelligence Leakage (Low to Medium Severity):** Metrics displayed by *pghero* could provide competitors with insights.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Metrics:** Medium risk reduction. Limiting *pghero's metric exposure* reduces potential leakage.
    *   **Competitive Intelligence Leakage:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Minimizes risk of sharing competitive intelligence via *pghero's data*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No specific review or limitation of *pghero's exposed metrics* has been performed.
