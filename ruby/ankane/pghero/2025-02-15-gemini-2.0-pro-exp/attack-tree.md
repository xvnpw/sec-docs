## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Access to PgHero Dashboard [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_access_to_pghero_dashboard__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the foundational step for most attacks.  Without access to the PgHero dashboard, an attacker cannot directly leverage PgHero's functionalities.
*   **Why Critical:**  It's the gateway to all other PgHero-specific attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__bypass_authentication.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Exploit Weak/Default Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__exploit_weakdefault_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1.1.1. Brute-force PgHero login (if custom auth is used).**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to guess the username and password by trying many combinations.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password policy and rate limiting)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to PgHero)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools are readily available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts can be logged and monitored)
    *   **Mitigation:** Strong password policies, rate limiting, account lockout, multi-factor authentication (MFA).

*   **1.1.1.2. Use default credentials (if not changed).**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses known default credentials for the application or authentication system protecting PgHero.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Should be changed during initial setup)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to PgHero)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Successful login with default credentials should trigger alerts)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Mandatory password change on first login, configuration reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__session_hijacking.md)

*   **1.1.3.1. Steal session cookie (if HttpOnly/Secure flags are missing). [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker obtains a valid session cookie, allowing them to impersonate a legitimate user. This often happens if `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are not set on the cookie.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If misconfigured)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to PgHero)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires access to network traffic or successful XSS)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual session activity or IP address changes might be detected)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies, use HTTPS, implement robust session management (short timeouts, strong session ID generation).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4. Exploit Misconfigured Authentication Integration](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4__exploit_misconfigured_authentication_integration.md)

*   **1.1.4.1. If using Basic Auth, exploit weak password policies. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to brute-forcing, but specifically targets weak password policies when Basic Authentication is used.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's password policy)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to PgHero)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts can be logged)
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements), avoid Basic Auth if possible, use more secure authentication methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Network Eavesdropping](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__network_eavesdropping.md)

*   **1.2.1. Intercept unencrypted traffic (if PgHero is not served over HTTPS). [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker passively captures network traffic between the user and PgHero, obtaining credentials and other sensitive data.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If misconfigured - i.e., not using HTTPS)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of credentials and any data transmitted)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Passive sniffing requires minimal effort)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network monitoring can detect unencrypted traffic)
    *   **Mitigation:**  *Always* serve PgHero over HTTPS.  Use a valid TLS certificate.  Enable HSTS.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit PgHero Functionality After Gaining Access [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_pghero_functionality_after_gaining_access__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Once an attacker has access to the PgHero dashboard, they can use its features for malicious purposes.
*   **Why Critical:** This represents the potential damage *after* a successful login.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Run Arbitrary SQL Queries (If PgHero allows this and permissions are misconfigured) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__run_arbitrary_sql_queries__if_pghero_allows_this_and_permissions_are_misconfigured___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses PgHero's interface (if it allows query execution) to run arbitrary SQL commands against the database.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on PgHero's configuration and the database user's privileges)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for data exfiltration, modification, or destruction)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If the interface allows it)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual queries can be logged and monitored)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The database user PgHero uses *must* have the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  Ideally, read-only access to specific system views and tables.  *Never* use a superuser account.
        *   **Disable Query Execution:** If PgHero allows arbitrary query execution and it's not strictly necessary, disable this feature.
        *   **Input Validation:** If query execution is allowed, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Database Firewall:** Consider using a database firewall to restrict the types of queries that can be executed.

        *   **2.1.1. Data Exfiltration (SELECT sensitive data).**
            *   **Description:**  Use `SELECT` statements to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
        *   **2.1.2. Data Modification (UPDATE, DELETE data).**
            *   **Description:** Use `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to alter or remove data from the database.
        *   **2.1.3. Database Disruption (DROP tables, shutdown database).**
            *   **Description:** Use `DROP` or other destructive commands to damage the database or make it unavailable.
