# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Session Hijacking (1.1.3.1)

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the risk, impact, and mitigation strategies for session hijacking attacks targeting PgHero, specifically focusing on the scenario where session cookies are stolen due to missing `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.  This analysis will inform development and operational decisions to enhance PgHero's security posture.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **Target Application:** PgHero (https://github.com/ankane/pghero) and its deployment environment.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Session hijacking via theft of session cookies lacking `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  An external attacker with the capability to intercept network traffic (e.g., through a compromised Wi-Fi network, Man-in-the-Middle attack) or exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  The consequences of a successful session hijack, specifically on the PgHero application and the underlying PostgreSQL database it manages.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Both preventative and detective controls to reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it with a detailed threat model specific to PgHero.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will examine PgHero's codebase (and relevant dependencies) for potential vulnerabilities that could contribute to this attack vector.  This includes reviewing how session management is implemented.
3.  **Impact Analysis:**  We will assess the potential damage an attacker could inflict after successfully hijacking a PgHero session.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  We will propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks, prioritizing the most effective and practical solutions.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:** We will identify any remaining risks after implementing the proposed mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.3.1 (Steal Session Cookie)

### 4.1. Threat Model Refinement

The initial attack tree path provides a good starting point.  Let's refine the threat model:

*   **Attacker Motivation:**
    *   **Data Theft:**  Accessing sensitive database information (queries, performance metrics, potentially even database credentials if PgHero is misconfigured).
    *   **Database Manipulation:**  Altering database configurations, potentially causing denial of service or data corruption.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Using PgHero as a stepping stone to gain access to the underlying database server or other connected systems.
    *   **Reputation Damage:**  Causing downtime or data breaches that harm the organization's reputation.

*   **Attack Vectors (Detailed):**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  The attacker intercepts network traffic between the user's browser and the PgHero server.  This is significantly easier if HTTPS is not enforced or if the user is on an untrusted network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).  Without the `Secure` flag, the browser will send the cookie over unencrypted HTTP connections.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the PgHero web interface (or a related application).  This code can then access the session cookie if the `HttpOnly` flag is not set.  The injected script can then send the cookie to the attacker.
    *   **Client-Side Malware:**  Malware on the user's machine could potentially access browser cookies, regardless of flags (though `HttpOnly` makes it harder).
    *   **Physical Access:**  If an attacker gains physical access to a user's machine while they are logged in, they could potentially copy the cookie from the browser's developer tools.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis (PgHero Specific)

*   **Session Management Implementation:**  We need to examine how PgHero (and its underlying framework, likely Rails) handles session creation, storage, and termination.  Key questions:
    *   **Cookie Configuration:**  Does PgHero explicitly set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies?  Are there configuration options to control this?  Are there any default settings that might be insecure?
    *   **Session ID Generation:**  Is the session ID generation algorithm cryptographically secure and resistant to prediction?  Rails generally uses a strong random number generator, but it's worth verifying.
    *   **Session Timeout:**  Does PgHero enforce a reasonable session timeout?  Shorter timeouts reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.
    *   **Session Invalidation:**  Are sessions properly invalidated upon logout?  Are there mechanisms to invalidate sessions remotely (e.g., if suspicious activity is detected)?

*   **Dependency Review:**  PgHero relies on other libraries (e.g., Rails, Rack, potentially JavaScript libraries).  We need to check for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies that could be exploited to steal session cookies.

*   **XSS Prevention:**  PgHero's codebase needs to be reviewed for potential XSS vulnerabilities.  This includes:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Are all user inputs properly validated and sanitized to prevent the injection of malicious code?
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Is all user-supplied data properly encoded when displayed in the web interface?
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Does PgHero implement a CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded?  A well-configured CSP can mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

### 4.3. Impact Analysis

A successful session hijack of a PgHero session could have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker could access all the information available through PgHero, including:
    *   **Running Queries:**  Revealing sensitive data being accessed or manipulated.
    *   **Slow Queries:**  Identifying potential performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database Statistics:**  Gaining insights into the database structure and usage patterns.
    *   **Configuration Details:**  Potentially revealing database connection strings or other sensitive settings.

*   **Database Manipulation:**  Depending on the PgHero configuration and user permissions, the attacker might be able to:
    *   **Modify Settings:**  Change database parameters, potentially causing performance degradation or data loss.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Queries:**  If PgHero allows it (and the user has the necessary privileges), the attacker could run arbitrary SQL commands, potentially deleting data, creating new users, or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Disable Monitoring:**  The attacker could disable PgHero's monitoring features to cover their tracks.

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker might be able to use the compromised PgHero session to gain access to the underlying database server or other systems.

*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could lead to significant reputational damage for the organization, especially if sensitive data is compromised.

### 4.4. Mitigation Recommendations

Here are specific, actionable steps to mitigate the risk of session hijacking:

*   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Ensure that PgHero is *only* accessible over HTTPS.  This prevents MitM attacks from easily intercepting session cookies.  Use a valid TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.
*   **Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` Flags:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation.  Configure PgHero (and the underlying Rails application) to set both the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on all session cookies.  This prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie (mitigating XSS) and ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.  This should be the default, but it's crucial to verify.
    *   **Rails Configuration:**  In `config/application.rb` or `config/environments/*.rb`, ensure the following is set:
        ```ruby
        config.session_store :cookie_store, key: '_your_app_session', httponly: true, secure: Rails.env.production?
        ```
        The `secure: Rails.env.production?` part is important; it ensures the `Secure` flag is only set in production, which is where you should be using HTTPS.  You might need to adjust this based on your specific deployment.
*   **Strong Session ID Generation:**  Verify that Rails is using a cryptographically secure random number generator for session IDs.  This is usually the default, but it's worth checking.
*   **Short Session Timeouts:**  Implement short session timeouts to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker.  Balance security with usability.  Consider implementing both idle timeouts (inactivity) and absolute timeouts (maximum session duration).
*   **Session Invalidation:**  Ensure that sessions are properly invalidated upon logout.  Provide a clear "Logout" button.  Consider implementing a mechanism to remotely invalidate sessions (e.g., if suspicious activity is detected).
*   **Robust XSS Prevention:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent the injection of malicious code.  Use a well-established sanitization library.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-supplied data when displaying it in the web interface.  Rails' built-in helpers (e.g., `h()`, `sanitize()`) can be used for this.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  This can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Keep all dependencies (Rails, Rack, other gems) up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Bundler) and regularly check for updates.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as:
    *   **Unusual Login Patterns:**  Logins from unexpected IP addresses or at unusual times.
    *   **Multiple Failed Login Attempts:**  Could indicate a brute-force attack.
    *   **Changes to Session Data:**  If session data is being modified unexpectedly.
    *   **Anomalous Database Queries:**  Queries that are significantly different from normal usage patterns.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While not directly preventing cookie theft, 2FA adds a significant layer of security. Even if an attacker steals a session cookie, they would still need the second factor to access the PgHero interface. This is a highly recommended mitigation.

### 4.5. Residual Risk Assessment

Even after implementing all the above mitigations, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There is always the possibility of unknown vulnerabilities in PgHero, its dependencies, or the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Client-Side Malware:**  Sophisticated malware on the user's machine could potentially bypass some of these protections.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker could trick a user into revealing their credentials or session information.
*   **Insider Threats:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access could bypass some security controls.

These residual risks should be acknowledged and addressed through ongoing security monitoring, incident response planning, and user education.

## 5. Conclusion

Session hijacking via stolen cookies is a serious threat to PgHero, particularly if `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are not properly configured.  By implementing the recommended mitigations, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and a proactive approach to security are essential to maintain a strong security posture for PgHero and the sensitive data it manages.
