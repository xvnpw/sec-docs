# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to PgHero Dashboard](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_pghero_dashboard.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to PgHero Dashboard

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the PgHero dashboard without proper authentication. This could be through brute-forcing weak credentials configured *for PgHero*, exploiting a session management vulnerability *within PgHero*, or bypassing PgHero's authentication altogether due to a misconfiguration *in PgHero's setup*.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains full access to all information displayed by PgHero, including sensitive database schema details, query performance data, and potentially even data previews. This can lead to data breaches, further attacks on the database, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** PgHero Web Interface (entire application), Authentication mechanisms (e.g., `pghero.rb` initializer, any authentication middleware *specifically used by PgHero*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all PgHero users.
        *   Use a robust authentication framework and ensure proper session management (e.g., secure cookies, session timeouts) *within PgHero's configuration*.
        *   Regularly review and update PgHero's authentication configurations.
        *   Consider using an external authentication provider (e.g., OAuth, LDAP) integrated *with PgHero*.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via PgHero's Query Input (if present)](./threats/sql_injection_via_pghero's_query_input__if_present_.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via PgHero's Query Input (if present)

    *   **Description:** If PgHero, *through a custom modification or extension*, allows users to input custom SQL queries, an attacker could craft a malicious SQL query to bypass intended restrictions. This is *not* a standard feature of PgHero, but a potential vulnerability if custom code has been added.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, data deletion, or even gaining control of the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any *custom-built* PgHero component that accepts and executes user-supplied SQL (e.g., a custom query input field, a filtering mechanism that uses raw SQL). This is *not* a core feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if such a component exists)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing users to input raw SQL queries directly *within any custom PgHero extensions*.
        *   If custom SQL input is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) *exclusively*. Never construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious characters from being passed to the database *within the custom PgHero code*.
        *   Use a database user with the absolute minimum privileges required.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via PgHero's Data Display](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_pghero's_data_display.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via PgHero's Data Display

    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained access to the PgHero dashboard (through legitimate or illegitimate means), uses the information *displayed by PgHero* (query plans, table statistics, slow query logs) to identify vulnerabilities and extract sensitive data *indirectly*. This leverages PgHero's *intended functionality* as a reconnaissance tool.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains insights into the database schema, data distribution, and application logic, which can be used to craft more targeted attacks. They might identify sensitive data columns or tables, or discover patterns that reveal confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** All PgHero components that display database information (e.g., "Space" view, "Queries" view, "Indexes" view). This is *inherent* to PgHero's design.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to PgHero (as per the "Unauthorized Access" threat). This is the primary mitigation.
        *   Use a database user with the *least privilege* necessary for PgHero to function. This limits the data PgHero *can access and therefore display*.
        *   Consider using a read-only replica for PgHero.

## Threat: [Exploitation of PgHero Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_pghero_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of PgHero Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability *in the PgHero codebase itself* (e.g., a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability) to gain unauthorized access or control. This targets bugs *within PgHero*.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component *within PgHero* (e.g., a particular view, a function that handles user input, a dependency).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PgHero and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   Regularly review PgHero's release notes and security advisories.
        *   Conduct security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities *in PgHero*.
        *   Run PgHero with the least privileges necessary (on the operating system level).

## Threat: [Compromise of PgHero's Database Connection *Due to PgHero Misconfiguration*](./threats/compromise_of_pghero's_database_connection_due_to_pghero_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:**  Compromise of PgHero's Database Connection *Due to PgHero Misconfiguration*

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials used by PgHero to connect to the database *because those credentials were improperly stored or configured within PgHero's settings*. This is a direct result of how PgHero is set up, not a general database security issue.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains direct access to the database with the privileges of the PgHero user. If the PgHero user has excessive privileges (e.g., superuser), this could lead to complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** PgHero's database connection configuration (e.g., `config/database.yml` if using Rails, environment variables *as used by PgHero*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for the PgHero database user.
        *   Store database credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets manager, *never* directly in the PgHero codebase or configuration files that are checked into version control).
        *   Use a database user with the *absolute minimum* privileges required for PgHero to function. This is crucial.
        *   Regularly rotate database credentials.
