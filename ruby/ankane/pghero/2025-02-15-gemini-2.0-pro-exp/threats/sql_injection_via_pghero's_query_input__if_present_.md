# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Custom PgHero Query Input

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from *custom modifications or extensions* to PgHero that might introduce user-supplied SQL query input.  We aim to understand the attack vectors, potential impact, and robust mitigation strategies, focusing on the *non-standard* use case where custom code has been added to PgHero.  This is *not* an analysis of the core PgHero library itself, which is designed to be secure.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on:

*   **Custom PgHero Modifications:**  Any code added to PgHero, or any extensions built on top of PgHero, that introduce the ability for users to input SQL queries directly or indirectly (e.g., through filter parameters that are then used to construct SQL).
*   **User-Supplied Input:**  Any input field, parameter, or data source that originates from a user and is used, even after processing, in the construction of a SQL query executed by the modified PgHero instance.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:**  The analysis assumes a PostgreSQL database is the target, as this is PgHero's intended database system.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   **Standard PgHero Functionality:**  The core features of PgHero, as provided by the `ankane/pghero` repository, are assumed to be secure in their default configuration.  This analysis is *only* concerned with custom additions.
*   **Other Attack Vectors:**  This analysis focuses solely on SQL injection.  Other potential vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) are outside the scope.
*   **Other Databases:** While the principles might apply, this analysis is tailored to PostgreSQL.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat as defined in the threat model, clarifying assumptions and preconditions.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Identify specific ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability, including example malicious inputs.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of a successful SQL injection attack.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Provide detailed, actionable recommendations for preventing the vulnerability, including code examples where appropriate.
5.  **Testing and Verification:**  Outline how to test for the presence of the vulnerability and verify the effectiveness of mitigations.

## 2. Threat Modeling Review

**Threat:** SQL Injection via PgHero's Query Input (if present)

**Description:**  A custom modification or extension to PgHero allows users to input SQL queries (directly or indirectly).  An attacker can craft malicious SQL input to bypass intended restrictions and execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Preconditions:**

*   A custom modification or extension to PgHero exists that accepts user input and uses it to construct SQL queries.
*   The application does *not* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) exclusively for all user-supplied data used in SQL queries.
*   The application does *not* have robust input validation and sanitization in place to prevent malicious SQL fragments from being injected.
*   The database user has more privileges than the absolute minimum required.

**Assumptions:**

*   The attacker has access to the user interface or API endpoint that accepts the custom SQL input.
*   The attacker has some knowledge of the database schema (or can obtain it through error messages or other information leakage).

## 3. Attack Vector Analysis

Several attack vectors are possible, depending on how the custom PgHero modification is implemented.  Here are a few examples:

**3.1. Direct SQL Input:**

*   **Scenario:** A custom PgHero page provides a text area where users can enter a SQL query to be executed directly.
*   **Example Malicious Input:**
    ```sql
    '; DROP TABLE users; --
    ```
    Or
        ```sql
    ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The attacker injects a semicolon (`;`) to terminate the intended query and then adds their own malicious SQL commands (e.g., `DROP TABLE`, `UNION SELECT`). The `--` comments out any remaining part of the original query.

**3.2. Indirect SQL Input (Filtering):**

*   **Scenario:** A custom PgHero extension allows users to filter data based on a user-provided value.  This value is then used *unsafely* to construct a `WHERE` clause in a SQL query.
*   **Example Malicious Input:**  If the intended query is something like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'user_input'`, the attacker might input:
    ```
    ' OR 1=1; --
    ```
*   **Explanation:**  This input would change the query to `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '' OR 1=1; --'`.  The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, so the query would return all rows from the `products` table, bypassing the intended filter.

**3.3. Blind SQL Injection:**

*   **Scenario:**  The application doesn't directly display the results of the injected SQL, but the attacker can infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., response time, error messages).
*   **Example Malicious Input:**
    ```sql
    ' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND SUBSTRING(password, 1, 1)='a') THEN 1 ELSE pg_sleep(5) END) = 1; --
    ```
*   **Explanation:**  This is a time-based blind SQL injection.  The attacker is trying to guess the first character of the admin user's password.  If the first character is 'a', the query will execute quickly.  If not, the `pg_sleep(5)` function will cause a 5-second delay.  By systematically trying different characters, the attacker can extract the password one character at a time.

## 4. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack on a custom PgHero component can be **critical**, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from any table in the database, including user credentials, financial information, personal data, etc.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter data in the database, potentially corrupting data, changing user permissions, or inserting malicious content.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers can delete data, causing data loss and potentially disrupting application functionality.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries or commands that make the database unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Database Server Compromise:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to leverage SQL injection to gain control of the database server itself, potentially leading to further attacks on the network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization responsible for the application.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can result in significant fines and legal liabilities, especially if sensitive data is compromised.

## 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

The following mitigation strategies are *essential* for preventing SQL injection in custom PgHero modifications:

**5.1. Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) - The Primary Defense:**

*   **Principle:**  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data.  The database engine treats the user input as data, *not* as part of the SQL command, preventing injection.
*   **Implementation (Example - Python with `psycopg2`):**

    ```python
    import psycopg2

    # UNSAFE (Vulnerable to SQL Injection)
    def unsafe_query(conn, user_input):
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{user_input}'")  # NEVER DO THIS
        return cursor.fetchall()

    # SAFE (Using Parameterized Queries)
    def safe_query(conn, user_input):
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (user_input,))  # Use %s placeholder
        return cursor.fetchall()

    # Example usage
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydatabase user=myuser password=mypassword")
    # ...
    results = safe_query(conn, "'; DROP TABLE users; --") # This will be treated as a username, not a command.
    print(results)
    conn.close()
    ```
    *   **Key Points:**
        *   Use the appropriate placeholder syntax for your database library (e.g., `%s` for `psycopg2`, `?` for some other libraries).
        *   Pass the user input as a *separate tuple or list* of parameters.
        *   *Never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.
        *   This applies to *all* SQL queries, including `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

**5.2. Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**

*   **Principle:**  Even with parameterized queries, it's good practice to validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats.  This adds an extra layer of defense.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that the input is of the correct data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of input strings to prevent excessively long inputs that might be used in denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns and reject any input that doesn't match.  This is more secure than blacklisting (trying to block specific malicious characters).
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of the input (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
    *   **Escaping (with caution):** While parameterized queries handle escaping automatically, if you *must* perform manual escaping (which is generally discouraged), use the database-specific escaping functions provided by your database library (e.g., `psycopg2.extensions.quote_ident` for identifiers, `psycopg2.extensions.quote_literal` for string literals).  *Never* roll your own escaping function.

**5.3. Least Privilege Principle:**

*   **Principle:**  The database user account used by the PgHero application (and its custom extensions) should have the *absolute minimum* privileges required to perform its intended functions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Create a dedicated database user for the application.
    *   Grant only the necessary privileges to this user (e.g., `SELECT` on specific tables, `INSERT` on others).
    *   *Never* use the database superuser account (e.g., `postgres`) for the application.
    *   Consider using row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL to further restrict access to data based on user roles or attributes.

**5.4. Avoid Dynamic SQL Generation (if possible):**

* **Principle:** If the structure of your SQL query needs to change based on user input (e.g., selecting different columns), try to achieve this using application logic *before* constructing the query, rather than by directly incorporating user input into the SQL.
* **Example:** Instead of:
    ```sql
    -- UNSAFE: user_input might be "column1; DROP TABLE users"
    SELECT {user_input} FROM my_table;
    ```
    Do:
    ```python
    # Safer:  Validate allowed_columns beforehand
    allowed_columns = ["column1", "column2", "column3"]
    if user_input in allowed_columns:
        cursor.execute(f"SELECT {user_input} FROM my_table") # Still use parameterized queries if there are other parameters!
    else:
        # Handle invalid input
        pass
    ```
    Even better, predefine the possible queries and select the appropriate one based on user input:
    ```python
        query_options = {
            "option1": "SELECT column1 FROM my_table",
            "option2": "SELECT column2, column3 FROM my_table",
        }
        if user_input in query_options:
            cursor.execute(query_options[user_input]) # Still use parameterized queries if there are other parameters!
        else:
            # Handle invalid input
            pass
```

**5.5. Code Reviews and Security Audits:**

*   **Principle:**  Regularly review the code of custom PgHero modifications for potential security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Incorporate security checks into the code review process.
    *   Conduct periodic security audits by experienced security professionals.
    *   Use static analysis tools to automatically scan the code for potential vulnerabilities.

## 6. Testing and Verification

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure that the mitigation strategies are effective:

**6.1. Unit Tests:**

*   Write unit tests for all functions that handle user input and interact with the database.
*   Include test cases with both valid and invalid input, including known SQL injection payloads.
*   Verify that parameterized queries are used correctly and that input validation is enforced.

**6.2. Integration Tests:**

*   Test the interaction between the custom PgHero component and the database.
*   Use a test database that is separate from the production database.
*   Simulate realistic user scenarios, including attempts to inject malicious SQL.

**6.3. Penetration Testing:**

*   Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on the application, specifically targeting the custom PgHero component.
*   Penetration testing should simulate real-world attacks to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

**6.4. Automated Security Scanners:**

*   Use automated security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to scan the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Configure the scanners to target the custom PgHero component.

**6.5. Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious database activity, such as unusual queries or errors.
*   Configure alerts to notify security personnel of potential SQL injection attempts.

## Conclusion

SQL injection is a serious threat, and custom modifications to PgHero that introduce user-supplied SQL input are particularly vulnerable. By diligently applying the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis – especially the *exclusive* use of parameterized queries – developers can effectively eliminate this risk.  Regular testing and security reviews are essential to ensure the ongoing security of the application.  Remember, this analysis pertains *only* to custom code added to PgHero; the core library itself is designed with security in mind.
