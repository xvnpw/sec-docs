## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for Web Interface (pghero Context)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_web_interface__pghero_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Authentication and Authorization for Web Interface (pghero Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess pghero's Built-in Authentication:**  Check pghero's documentation and configuration options to determine if it offers any built-in authentication mechanisms.  Standard pghero, as a monitoring tool, often lacks built-in user management.
    2.  **Implement Reverse Proxy Authentication (Recommended):** Since pghero likely lacks native authentication, the most common and effective approach is to implement authentication and authorization at the reverse proxy level (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Traefik).
        *   **Choose Authentication Method:** Select an authentication method supported by your reverse proxy, such as Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0/OIDC, or integration with an existing Identity Provider. Basic Authentication is a simple starting point for internal access.
        *   **Configure Reverse Proxy:** Configure your reverse proxy to require authentication for the pghero web interface path. Define users and passwords (for Basic Auth) or configure the OAuth 2.0/OIDC flow.
        *   **Restrict Access:**  Configure authorization rules in your reverse proxy to control which authenticated users or groups are allowed to access the pghero web interface.
    3.  **Consider Application-Level Authentication (If Customizing pghero):** If you are extending or modifying pghero's codebase, you could implement application-level authentication within the pghero application itself. This would require code changes and integration with an authentication framework suitable for pghero's technology stack (likely Ruby on Rails if using the standard pghero). This is a more complex approach than reverse proxy authentication.
    4.  **Test Authentication and Authorization:** Thoroughly test the implemented authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access the pghero web interface.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Monitoring Data (High Severity):** Without authentication on the pghero web interface, anyone who discovers the URL can access potentially sensitive database performance metrics exposed by pghero. This is a direct risk introduced by deploying pghero without access controls.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Low Severity - if pghero allows configuration changes):** While less common in standard pghero, if your deployment or customizations allow any configuration changes through the web interface, lack of authorization could allow unauthorized users to modify pghero settings.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Monitoring Data (High Impact):**  Completely mitigates the risk of unauthorized access to pghero's web interface and the database performance data it displays.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Medium Impact):** Mitigates the risk of unauthorized configuration changes if such capabilities exist in your pghero deployment.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The pghero web interface is currently accessible without any authentication, directly exposing monitoring data.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of authentication and authorization, ideally at the reverse proxy level, to protect the pghero web interface from unauthorized access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Exposed Metrics (pghero Context)](./mitigation_strategies/review_exposed_metrics__pghero_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review Exposed Metrics (pghero Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand pghero's Default Metrics:** Familiarize yourself with the default set of metrics that pghero collects and displays. Refer to pghero's documentation and explore the web interface to see the dashboards and data points.
    2.  **Assess Sensitivity in Your Context:** Evaluate the sensitivity of these metrics *specifically within your environment*. Consider if any of the default metrics, or combinations of metrics, could reveal sensitive information about your application, database schema, business logic, or user data *indirectly*.  For example, query patterns, table names, or performance spikes related to specific operations might be considered sensitive in your context.
    3.  **Minimize Exposure via pghero Configuration (If Possible):** Check pghero's configuration options to see if there are any settings to disable or customize the metrics collection.  While pghero's customization might be limited, explore if you can reduce the set of metrics collected or displayed through configuration.
    4.  **Consider Custom pghero Modifications (Advanced):** If configuration options are insufficient, and you have developers familiar with Ruby and Rails, consider modifying pghero's code to customize the metrics collection or dashboard display. This is an advanced approach and requires understanding pghero's codebase. You could potentially:
        *   Remove specific metrics from queries.
        *   Aggregate or anonymize data before display.
        *   Modify dashboards to hide or obscure certain metrics.
    5.  **Regularly Re-evaluate:** Periodically review the metrics exposed by pghero, especially after updates to pghero itself or changes to your application and database schema. Ensure that newly introduced metrics or changes in data patterns do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Monitoring Data (Low to Medium Severity):**  Pghero, by design, exposes database performance metrics. While intended for monitoring, these metrics could, in certain contexts, indirectly reveal sensitive information if not carefully reviewed. This is a risk inherent in using any monitoring tool if not configured with security in mind.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Monitoring Data (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unintentional information disclosure through the pghero dashboard by carefully controlling and reviewing the exposed metrics.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Initial understanding of default metrics exists, but no formal process for sensitivity assessment or metric minimization is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal assessment of the sensitivity of pghero's metrics in the project's specific context. Exploration of pghero configuration options for metric customization. Consideration of custom code modifications (if necessary and feasible) to minimize exposure of potentially sensitive information. Establishment of a regular review process for exposed metrics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Informed about pghero Security Updates (pghero Context)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_informed_about_pghero_security_updates__pghero_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Stay Informed about pghero Security Updates (pghero Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor pghero GitHub Repository:** Regularly monitor the official pghero GitHub repository ([https://github.com/ankane/pghero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero)).
        *   **Watch Releases:** Pay attention to new releases and release notes. Security patches are often included in releases.
        *   **Watch Issues:** Monitor the "Issues" tab for reported security vulnerabilities or discussions related to security. Search for keywords like "security", "vulnerability", "CVE", etc.
        *   **Watch Pull Requests:** Review pull requests, especially those tagged with "security" or "fix", as they might contain security-related fixes.
    2.  **Check for Security Announcements:** Look for dedicated security announcements or security advisories related to pghero. These might be posted in the GitHub repository, on the project's website (if any), or in relevant community forums.
    3.  **Subscribe to GitHub Notifications (Optional):** Consider "watching" the pghero repository on GitHub to receive notifications about new releases, issues, and pull requests. This can help you stay informed about project activity, including security updates.
    4.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** When security updates or patches are released for pghero, plan and apply them to your pghero deployment as quickly as possible, following the project's update instructions.
    5.  **Test After Updates:** After applying updates, thoroughly test your pghero deployment to ensure the update was successful and hasn't introduced any regressions or broken functionality.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in pghero Itself (Variable Severity):** Like any software, pghero might contain security vulnerabilities. If vulnerabilities are discovered and publicly disclosed, attackers could potentially exploit them if you are running an outdated version of pghero. Staying updated is crucial to mitigate this direct risk from pghero itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in pghero Itself (High Impact - Preventative):**  Significantly reduces the risk of running vulnerable versions of pghero by proactively monitoring for and applying security updates, directly addressing potential security flaws within the pghero application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The development team is generally aware of pghero updates, but no formal, proactive monitoring process for security updates is in place. Updates are applied reactively rather than proactively for security reasons.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a formal process for proactively monitoring the pghero GitHub repository for security updates and announcements.  Implementation of a procedure for promptly applying security updates and testing after updates.
