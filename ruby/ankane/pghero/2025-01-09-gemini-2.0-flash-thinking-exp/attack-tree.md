## Attack Tree Path: [Use Default Credentials (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/use_default_credentials__if_any_.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker attempts to log in to the pghero interface using commonly known default usernames and passwords that might not have been changed after installation.
    - Likelihood: Low (if defaults exist, they are usually well-known and should be changed).
    - Impact: High (Full access to pghero, potentially database insights).
    - Effort: Very Low.
    - Skill Level: Low.
    - Detection Difficulty: Low.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on pghero Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/brute-forcedictionary_attack_on_pghero_credentials.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of username and password combinations to guess the correct credentials for the pghero interface.
    - Likelihood: Medium (depends on password complexity and if rate limiting is in place).
    - Impact: High (Full access to pghero, potentially database insights).
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Low to Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Missing or Weak Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_missing_or_weak_authentication.md)

- Attack Vector: The pghero interface is deployed without any authentication mechanism or with a trivially bypassable one, allowing anyone to access it.
    - Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on deployment practices).
    - Impact: High (Full access to pghero, potentially database insights).
    - Effort: Very Low.
    - Skill Level: Low.
    - Detection Difficulty: Very High (if no authentication is expected).

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Database Credentials from pghero Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/extract_database_credentials_from_pghero_configuration.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker gains access to the server or application files where pghero's configuration is stored and retrieves the database credentials (username, password, host, etc.).
    - Likelihood: Medium (if configuration is not properly secured).
    - Impact: Critical (Direct access to the database).
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection through pghero Interface](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_through_pghero_interface.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker manipulates input fields or parameters in the pghero interface to inject malicious SQL code that is then executed against the PostgreSQL database.
    - Likelihood: Medium to High (if input sanitization is lacking).
    - Impact: Critical (Full database compromise).
    - Effort: Low to Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium to High.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure through pghero Interface](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_through_pghero_interface.md)

- Attack Vector: The pghero interface displays sensitive database information that should not be accessible to the current user or is exposed unintentionally due to lack of proper filtering or access controls.
    - Likelihood: Medium (depends on the design and implementation of pghero).
    - Impact: Medium to High (Exposure of sensitive data).
    - Effort: Low.
    - Skill Level: Low.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via pghero](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_pghero.md)

- Significance: This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes leads to this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit pghero Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pghero_authenticationauthorization.md)

- Significance: Successful exploitation at this node allows the attacker to gain access to the pghero interface and its functionalities, opening the door for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit pghero Database Connection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pghero_database_connection.md)

- Significance: Successful exploitation here grants the attacker access to the database credentials, allowing them to directly access and manipulate the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit pghero Data Display/Processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pghero_data_displayprocessing.md)

- Significance: This node represents vulnerabilities in how pghero interacts with and displays database data, leading to critical issues like SQL injection and information disclosure.
