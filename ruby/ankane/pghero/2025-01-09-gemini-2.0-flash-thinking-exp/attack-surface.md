# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Sensitive Database Information](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_sensitive_database_information.md)

*   **Description:**  PgHero, by default, might expose routes that display sensitive database statistics without requiring authentication.
    *   **How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero's core functionality is to provide a web interface for viewing database internals. If these routes are accessible without authentication, the information is readily available to anyone.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker accesses `/pghero` or a similar route and can see table sizes, index usage, slow queries, and other database performance metrics without logging in.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers gain valuable insights into the database structure, performance bottlenecks, and potentially sensitive data usage patterns, aiding in planning further attacks or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms at the application level to protect the PgHero routes. This could involve requiring users to log in before accessing these pages.
        *   Restrict access to PgHero routes based on IP address or network segments if appropriate.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy or web server configuration to add an authentication layer in front of the PgHero application.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Database Statistics](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_database_statistics.md)

*   **Description:**  PgHero displays detailed database statistics that, while intended for monitoring, can reveal sensitive information about the application and its data.
    *   **How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero's primary function is to present this statistical data in an easily digestible format.
    *   **Example:** An attacker observes slow query logs revealing the structure of sensitive data queries or identifies tables with unusually large sizes, indicating potential areas of interest for data exfiltration.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of database schema, data relationships, and potential vulnerabilities, which can be used for reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider which PgHero features and metrics are exposed, even to authenticated users.
        *   Implement granular authorization controls within the application to restrict access to specific PgHero features based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Obfuscate or anonymize sensitive data where possible, reducing the impact of information disclosure through statistics.
        *   Regularly review the information exposed by PgHero and assess its potential security implications.
