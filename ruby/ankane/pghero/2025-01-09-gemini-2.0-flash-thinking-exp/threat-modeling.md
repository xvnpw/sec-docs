# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/pghero

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to pghero UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_pghero_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could bypass authentication or authorization controls to access the pghero interface. They might exploit weak or default credentials, vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism (if any is implemented beyond basic HTTP auth), or gain access through compromised accounts. Once inside, they can view sensitive database performance metrics and query details.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive database performance data, including query patterns, resource usage, and potential bottlenecks. This information could be used to understand database structure, identify vulnerabilities, or plan more sophisticated attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Web UI (specifically the authentication and authorization layer, or lack thereof).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the pghero interface. This could involve integrating with existing application authentication or using a dedicated authentication system.
        *   Enforce strong password policies if basic authentication is used.
        *   Restrict access to the pghero interface to authorized users only, potentially using network-level restrictions (e.g., firewall rules).
        *   Regularly review and update authentication configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Transit to pghero UI](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_transit_to_pghero_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the application server hosting pghero and the user's browser accessing the pghero UI. This could be achieved through man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured networks. The intercepted traffic could contain sensitive database performance data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of database performance metrics and potentially query details.
    *   **Affected Component:** Web UI (data transmission).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all connections to the pghero interface to encrypt data in transit.
        *   Ensure proper TLS configuration to prevent downgrade attacks.
        *   Educate users about the risks of accessing sensitive interfaces over untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials within pghero Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_within_pghero_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to the server or application configuration files where pghero's database connection details (including username and password) are stored. This could happen through various means, such as exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities in the application, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or through insider threats.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the PostgreSQL database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration handling (where database credentials are stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing database credentials directly in configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure methods for storing and retrieving credentials, such as environment variables with restricted access, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or operating system credential management.
        *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Regularly rotate database credentials.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities within pghero's Query Execution](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_within_pghero's_query_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If pghero constructs SQL queries based on user input (though less likely in a monitoring tool, but possible through configuration or parameters), there's a risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate these inputs to inject malicious SQL code, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the PostgreSQL database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query execution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit pghero's codebase for any instances where user-provided data could influence SQL query construction.
        *   Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing SQL queries within pghero.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any user-provided input that could influence query construction.
        *   Keep pghero updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
