# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ankane/searchkick

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries and Input Sanitization (Searchkick Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_and_input_sanitization__searchkick_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries and Input Sanitization (Searchkick Focus)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Searchkick's Query Builders:**  Primarily rely on Searchkick's built-in query methods like `Searchkick.search`, model-level `search`, and `where` clauses. These methods inherently use parameterized queries, reducing injection risks. Avoid constructing raw Elasticsearch query strings manually when using Searchkick.
    2.  **Sanitize Input Before Searchkick:** Even with Searchkick's parameterized queries, sanitize user input *before* passing it to Searchkick search methods. This adds a layer of defense against potential edge cases or misuse. Escape special characters that might be interpreted by Elasticsearch query syntax if they are not intended as operators.
    3.  **Validate Input Types for Searchkick:** Ensure that the data types of user inputs are validated before being used in Searchkick queries. For example, if you expect a numerical ID for a search filter, validate that the input is indeed a number before using it in a `where` clause within Searchkick.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Query Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Elasticsearch query syntax through search parameters processed by Searchkick, potentially manipulating queries or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Query Injection:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of query injection attacks by leveraging Searchkick's safe query construction and adding input sanitization as a preventative measure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the project. Searchkick is used with its built-in methods for most search functionalities. Input sanitization is performed on some frontend search fields, but server-side sanitization specifically for Searchkick inputs is inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side input sanitization needs to be consistently applied to all user-provided search inputs *before* they are processed by Searchkick methods. This is particularly important in backend API endpoints and admin panel search functionalities that utilize Searchkick.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Whitelisting Allowed Search Fields via Searchkick Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/whitelisting_allowed_search_fields_via_searchkick_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Whitelisting Allowed Search Fields via Searchkick Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define `fields` in Searchkick Models:**  Explicitly use the `fields` option within your Searchkick model definitions to declare which model attributes are searchable. This is Searchkick's primary mechanism for controlling searchable fields. Only include fields intended for user-accessible search in this list.
    2.  **Control Field Access in `search_data`:**  Within your model's `search_data` method (used by Searchkick to define indexed data), carefully select which attributes are included in the indexed data. Avoid including sensitive fields in `search_data` if they are not meant to be searchable or publicly accessible through search.
    3.  **Validate Field Parameters in Searchkick Queries:** If your application allows users to specify fields to search against (e.g., via API parameters that are then used in Searchkick queries), validate that these field names correspond to the whitelisted `fields` defined in your Searchkick models. Reject queries attempting to search against fields not in the Searchkick `fields` list.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting Searchkick queries that target sensitive or internal fields not intended for public search, potentially revealing confidential data through Searchkick's search results.
    *   **Elasticsearch Query Injection (Low Severity - Secondary Mitigation):** Reduces the attack surface for query injection by limiting the scope of searchable fields exposed through Searchkick.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Significantly reduces the chance of unintended data exposure through Searchkick by controlling searchable fields.
    *   **Elasticsearch Query Injection:** Low risk reduction. Acts as a defense-in-depth measure within the Searchkick context.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Searchkick models utilize the `fields` option to limit searchable attributes. However, validation of field parameters in API endpoints that use Searchkick is not consistently enforced. `search_data` methods are generally reviewed, but could be more rigorously audited for sensitive data inclusion.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement server-side validation to strictly enforce the whitelist of allowed search fields in all search endpoints that utilize Searchkick, especially API endpoints. This validation should ensure that any field parameters used in Searchkick queries are present in the `fields` list of the relevant Searchkick model.  Regularly audit `search_data` methods to ensure no unintended sensitive data is being indexed by Searchkick.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits (Relevant to Searchkick Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits__relevant_to_searchkick_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Query Complexity Limits (Relevant to Searchkick Usage)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limit Search Terms in Searchkick Queries:**  At the application level, impose limits on the number of search terms or clauses allowed in user-initiated Searchkick queries. This can be implemented by truncating or rejecting queries that exceed a defined term limit before they are passed to Searchkick.
    2.  **Review Searchkick Aggregations and Filters:** If using Searchkick's aggregation or filtering features, carefully review the complexity of these features in your application. Avoid allowing users to construct excessively complex aggregations or filter combinations through Searchkick that could lead to resource exhaustion in Elasticsearch.
    3.  **Monitor Searchkick Query Performance:**  Monitor the performance of Searchkick queries in your application. Identify slow or resource-intensive queries generated by Searchkick. Analyze these queries to understand their complexity and optimize them or impose stricter limits on user input to prevent complex Searchkick query generation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting overly complex Searchkick queries that, when translated to Elasticsearch queries, consume excessive resources, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the impact of DoS attacks originating from complex Searchkick queries. The effectiveness depends on the appropriateness of the limits and the typical query complexity generated by Searchkick in legitimate use cases.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application-level limits exist for the number of search terms in the main user-facing search bar, which indirectly limits Searchkick query complexity in that specific area. Monitoring of Searchkick query performance is not systematically in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement more comprehensive application-level limits on Searchkick query complexity, potentially including limits on the number of filters and aggregations used in advanced search functionalities powered by Searchkick.  Establish systematic monitoring of Searchkick query performance to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks and overly complex queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control Filtering in Searchkick Results](./mitigation_strategies/access_control_filtering_in_searchkick_results.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Access Control Filtering in Searchkick Results
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Authorization Checks Post-Searchkick:** After retrieving search results from Searchkick, implement authorization checks to filter these results based on the current user's permissions. Ensure that users only see results that they are authorized to access according to your application's access control policies.
    2.  **Filter Searchkick Results Based on User Context:**  Utilize user roles, permissions, or other relevant context information to filter the search results returned by Searchkick before displaying them to the user. This ensures that Searchkick results are contextually appropriate and respect access control rules.
    3.  **Consider Pre-Filtering in Searchkick Queries (Advanced):** In more complex scenarios, explore if you can incorporate authorization logic directly into your Searchkick queries using `where` clauses or similar mechanisms. This can be more efficient but requires careful design to avoid overly complex or insecure query construction.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive or confidential data through Searchkick search results that they should not be able to see, even if the data is indexed by Searchkick.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting Searchkick search functionality to gain access to data or resources that they are not normally authorized to access, by ensuring results are filtered based on permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses the risk of unauthorized data access through Searchkick search results by enforcing access control.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the potential for Searchkick to be used in privilege escalation attacks by filtering results based on authorization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authorization checks are in place for accessing individual records *after* retrieving them from Searchkick search results. However, initial Searchkick search results sets are not consistently filtered based on user permissions in all search functionalities.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement result-level authorization filtering *directly* on the Searchkick search results before displaying them to users. This ensures that users only see authorized results from the outset. This filtering needs to be consistently applied across all search endpoints utilizing Searchkick, especially API endpoints and admin interfaces.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Searchkick Updates and Dependency Management](./mitigation_strategies/regular_searchkick_updates_and_dependency_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Searchkick Updates and Dependency Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Searchkick Releases:** Regularly monitor the GitHub repository for `ankane/searchkick` and other relevant channels for new releases, security advisories, and bug fixes related to Searchkick.
    2.  **Update Searchkick Promptly:**  Apply updates to the Searchkick gem promptly after they are released, especially security updates and critical bug fixes. Keep Searchkick up-to-date with the latest stable version.
    3.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Searchkick Dependencies:**  Include Searchkick and its dependencies in your vulnerability scanning processes. Use tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Searchkick gem and its dependencies.
    4.  **Review Searchkick Changelogs:** When updating Searchkick, carefully review the changelogs and release notes to understand any security-related changes, bug fixes, or new features that might impact your application's security.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Searchkick (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of the Searchkick gem itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Searchkick:** High risk reduction. Essential for maintaining a secure application that utilizes Searchkick over time.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency updates, including Searchkick, are performed periodically, but not on a strict schedule driven by security advisories. Vulnerability scanning processes do not specifically target Searchkick and its dependencies.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a more rigorous process for monitoring Searchkick releases and security advisories. Implement automated or semi-automated processes for promptly updating Searchkick, especially for security updates. Integrate vulnerability scanning that specifically includes Searchkick and its dependencies into the CI/CD pipeline.
