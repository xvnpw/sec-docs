# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance application search functionality to provide fast and relevant search results.
  - Improve user experience by enabling efficient information retrieval.
  - Increase user engagement and satisfaction through improved search capabilities.
  - Enable data-driven decision-making by providing powerful search and analytics features.
- Business Risks:
  - Data breaches through vulnerabilities in search functionality or underlying Elasticsearch.
  - Denial of service due to resource exhaustion from excessive or malicious search queries.
  - Inaccurate or manipulated search results leading to incorrect business decisions or poor user experience.
  - Compliance violations if sensitive data is improperly indexed or exposed through search.
  - Performance degradation of the application due to inefficient search queries or Elasticsearch configuration.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure software development lifecycle for Ruby gem development (general practice, not explicitly stated for this project).
  - security control: Reliance on Elasticsearch security features for data protection and access control (if Elasticsearch is configured securely).
  - security control: Dependency management for Ruby gems to address known vulnerabilities in dependencies (general practice).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Risks associated with using Elasticsearch as a third-party search backend, including potential vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch itself.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the application developer to properly implement security best practices when using Searchkick.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Input validation and sanitization of search queries to prevent injection attacks.
  - recommended security control: Rate limiting and request throttling for search endpoints to mitigate denial of service attacks.
  - recommended security control: Monitoring and logging of search queries and Elasticsearch activity for security auditing and incident response.
  - recommended security control: Regular security vulnerability scanning and patching of Elasticsearch and Ruby dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Secure configuration of Elasticsearch, including access control, network security, and data encryption.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: While Searchkick itself does not handle user authentication, the application using Searchkick must implement authentication to verify the identity of users performing searches.
    - Implementation: Application-level authentication mechanisms (e.g., session-based, token-based) should be used to authenticate users before allowing search operations.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The application must implement authorization to control access to search functionality and the data that can be searched based on user roles and permissions.
    - Implementation: Application-level authorization checks should be performed before executing search queries to ensure users only access authorized data. Elasticsearch security features can also be used to enforce data-level access control.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user-provided search queries must be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., Elasticsearch injection).
    - Implementation: Implement input validation on the application side before passing queries to Searchkick and Elasticsearch. Use parameterized queries or query builders provided by Searchkick to avoid raw query construction.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data indexed and stored in Elasticsearch should be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect confidentiality.
    - Implementation: Configure Elasticsearch to use encryption at rest for indexed data. Ensure TLS/SSL is enabled for communication between the application, Searchkick, and Elasticsearch. Consider encrypting sensitive data fields before indexing if Elasticsearch encryption at rest is not sufficient.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - User search functionality is critical for user experience and information retrieval within applications using Searchkick.
  - Data indexing and search performance are important for application responsiveness and usability.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data protected by Searchkick depends on the data indexed in Elasticsearch by applications using Searchkick.
  - If applications index sensitive user data (e.g., PII, financial information), then this data becomes sensitive within the context of Searchkick and Elasticsearch.
  - The sensitivity level should be determined based on the specific application and the type of data being indexed.

  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to improve user experience and application functionality through enhanced search capabilities.
  - Question: What are the specific business KPIs that will be used to measure the success of implementing Searchkick?
  - Question: What is the acceptable level of risk for security vulnerabilities in the search functionality?
- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Security is a concern, but performance and ease of use are also high priorities.
  - Question: Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that need to be considered for data indexed and searched using Searchkick?
  - Question: What is the current security maturity level of the organization using Searchkick?
- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: Elasticsearch is already deployed and managed separately from the application using Searchkick.
  - Question: What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the search functionality?
  - Question: What is the data retention policy for indexed data in Elasticsearch?
  - Question: Are there any specific non-functional requirements (e.g., high availability, disaster recovery) for the search infrastructure?
