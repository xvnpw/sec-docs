# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/searchkick

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into search queries that are then passed to Elasticsearch.

**How Searchkick Contributes:** Searchkick often takes user input and constructs Elasticsearch queries. If not handled carefully, raw user input can be directly embedded into the query structure.

**Example:** A user enters `my product" OR _id:123456789` in a search field. If the application directly uses this in a Searchkick query without proper sanitization, it could bypass intended search logic and potentially return unintended data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation within Elasticsearch, potential denial of service on the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of the data and the extent of access control).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Searchkick's built-in query builders and methods: Avoid directly interpolating user input into raw Elasticsearch query strings. Utilize features like `where`, `match`, `term`, etc.
* Parameterize search queries: If direct query construction is necessary, use parameterized queries to separate code from data.
* Input validation and sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize user input before using it in search queries. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Indexing Data Manipulation leading to Stored XSS](./attack_surfaces/indexing_data_manipulation_leading_to_stored_xss.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into data that is indexed by Searchkick, leading to stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities when search results are displayed.

**How Searchkick Contributes:** Searchkick is responsible for indexing data into Elasticsearch. If the application doesn't sanitize data before indexing, malicious scripts can be stored.

**Example:** A user submits a product review containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If this review is indexed by Searchkick without sanitization, anyone viewing search results for that product could execute the malicious script.

**Impact:** Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement of the application.

**Risk Severity:** **High**.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Output encoding: Always encode data retrieved from Elasticsearch before displaying it in the application's UI. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML contexts, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript contexts).
* Input sanitization before indexing: Sanitize user-provided data before it is indexed by Searchkick. Remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource-Intensive Searches](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource-intensive_searches.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft search queries that consume excessive resources on the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to service disruption.

**How Searchkick Contributes:** Searchkick provides an interface for executing search queries. If the application doesn't limit the complexity or resource consumption of queries, it can be abused.

**Example:** An attacker sends a search request with a very broad wildcard query (`*`), a large `size` parameter, or deeply nested boolean queries, overwhelming the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Impact:** Temporary or prolonged unavailability of the search functionality or the entire application if Elasticsearch becomes overloaded.

**Risk Severity:** **High**.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement search query limitations: Set limits on query complexity, result size, and execution time.
* Rate limiting: Limit the number of search requests from a single user or IP address within a given timeframe.
