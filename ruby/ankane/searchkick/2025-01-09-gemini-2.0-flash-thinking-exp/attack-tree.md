## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Searchkick Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searchkick_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Critical Node: Weak Elasticsearch Credentials
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers obtain default, easily guessable, or leaked Elasticsearch credentials.
    *   Impact: Full, unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch instance, allowing for data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   Mitigation: Enforce strong, unique credentials for Elasticsearch. Rotate credentials regularly. Securely store and manage credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Searchkick Query Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searchkick_query_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Critical Node: Malicious Search Query Construction
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers craft malicious search queries by injecting Elasticsearch Query DSL commands or scripting language code into search parameters.
    *   Impact: Ability to execute arbitrary Elasticsearch operations, including data manipulation, information disclosure, and potentially remote code execution on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all search parameters. Avoid directly embedding user input into raw Elasticsearch queries. Use parameterized queries or safe query builders. Disable scripting in Elasticsearch if not necessary.
*   Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Elasticsearch Operations (e.g., script injection)
    *   Attack Vector: Successful injection of malicious scripts into Elasticsearch queries, leading to their execution.
    *   Impact: Remote code execution on the Elasticsearch server, potentially compromising the entire system.
    *   Mitigation: Disable scripting in Elasticsearch. If scripting is required, use a sandboxed environment and implement strict controls.
*   Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code on Elasticsearch Server
    *   Attack Vector: Successful execution of injected scripting code on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   Impact: Full control over the Elasticsearch server, allowing for data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
    *   Mitigation: Disable scripting in Elasticsearch. If scripting is required, use a sandboxed environment and implement strict controls.
*   Critical Node: Lack of Input Sanitization on Search Parameters
    *   Attack Vector: Failure to sanitize user-provided search parameters, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or commands.
    *   Impact: Enables query injection vulnerabilities, leading to various forms of attack, including information disclosure, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all search parameters before passing them to Searchkick.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities via Searchkick](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_elasticsearch_vulnerabilities_via_searchkick.md)

*   Critical Node: Leverage Known Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers identify a known vulnerability in the specific version of Elasticsearch being used and exploit it through interactions facilitated by Searchkick.
    *   Impact: Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   Mitigation: Keep Elasticsearch updated to the latest stable version with security patches. Regularly monitor for and apply security updates.
*   Critical Node: Trigger Vulnerability through Searchkick Interactions
    *   Attack Vector: Searchkick's interaction with Elasticsearch provides the pathway or conditions necessary to trigger a known Elasticsearch vulnerability.
    *   Impact: Exploitation of the underlying Elasticsearch vulnerability, leading to various security breaches.
    *   Mitigation: Keep Elasticsearch updated. Understand how Searchkick interacts with Elasticsearch and review for potential vulnerability triggers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Searchkick](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_searchkick.md)

*   Critical Node: Send Resource-Intensive Search Queries
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers craft and send complex or broad search queries that consume excessive resources on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   Impact: Service disruption, making the search functionality unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting on search requests. Analyze query complexity and reject overly resource-intensive queries. Set appropriate resource limits for Elasticsearch.
