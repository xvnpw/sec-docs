# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/searchkick

## Threat: [Accidental Indexing of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_indexing_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Threat:** Accidental Indexing of Sensitive Data
    * **Description:** An attacker might leverage the search functionality to query for sensitive information that was unintentionally indexed by Searchkick due to a lack of proper configuration *within Searchkick*. They could use specific keywords or filters to locate and retrieve this data.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data can lead to privacy violations, reputational damage, legal repercussions, and potential financial losses.
    * **Affected Component:** Searchkick's indexing process, specifically the `search_data` method and the default indexing behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Explicitly define the attributes to be indexed using the `search_data` method.
        * Regularly audit the indexed data in Elasticsearch to ensure no sensitive information is present.
        * Utilize Searchkick's callbacks (e.g., `should_reindex?`) to control when data is indexed, potentially skipping sensitive data.
        * Consider data masking or anonymization techniques before indexing sensitive fields.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Injection (Indirect)](./threats/elasticsearch_injection__indirect_.md)

**Threat:** Elasticsearch Injection (Indirect)
    * **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious input that, when processed by the application and used to build a search query *via Searchkick*, leads to the execution of unintended Elasticsearch queries. This could allow the attacker to bypass access controls, retrieve unauthorized data from Elasticsearch, or even manipulate data within the index.
    * **Impact:** Data exfiltration from Elasticsearch, unauthorized data modification within the search index, potential denial of service on Elasticsearch.
    * **Affected Component:** Searchkick's query building logic, specifically the methods that translate application-level search parameters into Elasticsearch queries (e.g., `where`, `match`, `suggest`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Searchkick updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Carefully validate and sanitize any user input that influences search parameters *before passing it to Searchkick*.
        * Avoid directly passing unsanitized user input into Searchkick's query methods.
        * Implement parameterized queries or use Searchkick's safer query building abstractions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Malicious Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_through_malicious_queries.md)

**Threat:** Denial of Service through Malicious Queries
    * **Description:** An attacker might submit intentionally complex or resource-intensive search queries *through the application's search functionality powered by Searchkick* that overwhelm the Elasticsearch instance, causing it to become slow or unresponsive, thus denying service to legitimate users.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdowns, unavailability of search functionality, potential impact on other services relying on the same Elasticsearch instance.
    * **Affected Component:** Elasticsearch interaction *initiated by Searchkick's query execution*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting and throttling for search requests *at the application level*.
        * Monitor Elasticsearch performance and resource usage.
        * Analyze and optimize frequently executed or resource-intensive queries *generated by Searchkick*.
        * Configure Elasticsearch query limits and timeouts.

## Threat: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials
    * **Description:** If the credentials used *by Searchkick* to connect to Elasticsearch are not securely managed and are exposed (e.g., hardcoded in the application, stored in version control), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch instance.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Elasticsearch data, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service on Elasticsearch, potentially compromising the application's search functionality.
    * **Affected Component:** Searchkick's configuration and connection management to Elasticsearch.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store Elasticsearch credentials securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        * Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
        * Ensure proper access controls and permissions for configuration files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Searchkick or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_searchkick_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Searchkick or its Dependencies
    * **Description:**  An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities within the Searchkick gem itself or its dependent libraries. This could allow for various malicious actions depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:** The Searchkick gem and its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Searchkick and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        * Regularly review security advisories for Searchkick and its dependencies.
        * Use tools like `bundler-audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
