## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Searchkick - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application using Searchkick by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the interaction between the application and Elasticsearch through Searchkick.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application Using Searchkick **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Elasticsearch Injection Vulnerabilities via Searchkick **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Craft Malicious Search Queries **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Elasticsearch Query DSL Commands **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Bypass Access Controls via Search Queries
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Insecure Indexing Practices
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Index Sensitive Data Without Proper Sanitization **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Elasticsearch Configuration Vulnerabilities Exposed by Searchkick **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Leverage Default or Weak Elasticsearch Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Open or Misconfigured Elasticsearch Ports **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application Using Searchkick [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Description:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the application.

**2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Elasticsearch Injection Vulnerabilities via Searchkick [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into Elasticsearch queries through Searchkick.

**3. Craft Malicious Search Queries [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Description:** The step where the attacker crafts specifically designed search queries to exploit vulnerabilities.

**4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Elasticsearch Query DSL Commands [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Mechanism:** Inject commands within search parameters that are directly passed to Elasticsearch's query DSL.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (High), data manipulation (High), denial of service on Elasticsearch (Medium), potentially remote code execution if Elasticsearch is vulnerable (Critical).
*   **Mitigation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs, use Searchkick's query builders, implement strict input validation, follow Elasticsearch security best practices.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Critical
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**5. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Access Controls via Search Queries:**

*   **Mechanism:** Craft search queries that circumvent intended access control logic implemented in the application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access (High).
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust authorization checks at the application level, avoid relying solely on Elasticsearch's query-based filtering, ensure Searchkick configuration doesn't expose data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**6. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Indexing Practices:**

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how data is indexed into Elasticsearch.

**7. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Index Sensitive Data Without Proper Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Mechanism:** Sensitive data is indexed without proper sanitization, making it searchable and potentially accessible through vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (High).
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict data sanitization and filtering before indexing, avoid indexing unnecessary sensitive data, consider using field-level security in Elasticsearch.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

**8. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Elasticsearch Configuration Vulnerabilities Exposed by Searchkick [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the configuration of the Elasticsearch cluster that are accessible or exposed through Searchkick.

**9. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Default or Weak Elasticsearch Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Mechanism:** If the application uses Searchkick with default or weak Elasticsearch credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Elasticsearch data (Critical), potential application compromise (Critical).
*   **Mitigation:** Never use default Elasticsearch credentials, implement strong authentication and authorization for Elasticsearch, securely manage Elasticsearch credentials used by Searchkick.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

**10. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Open or Misconfigured Elasticsearch Ports [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Mechanism:** If Elasticsearch ports are exposed without proper firewall rules, an attacker can directly interact with the Elasticsearch API, bypassing the application.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Elasticsearch data (Critical), potential application compromise (Critical).
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure Elasticsearch ports are not publicly accessible and are protected by firewalls, implement network segmentation to isolate the Elasticsearch cluster.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
