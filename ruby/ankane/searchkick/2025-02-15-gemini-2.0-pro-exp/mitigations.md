# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ankane/searchkick

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `search_data` Definition](./mitigation_strategies/strict__search_data__definition.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Define the `search_data` method with extreme precision, whitelisting only necessary fields.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Models:** In your Rails application, find all models using the `searchkick` gem.
    2.  **Review/Create `search_data`:** For each model, carefully examine or create the `search_data` method.
    3.  **Whitelist Fields:**  Explicitly list *only* the fields absolutely required for search.  *Do not* use `attributes` or similar methods that include all fields.
    4.  **Data Sensitivity:** Assess the sensitivity of each field. Exclude private data, API keys, internal IDs, or anything not intended for public search.
    5.  **Nested Objects:** If indexing data from associated models, include only necessary fields from those associations (e.g., `category.name`, not the entire `category` object).
    6.  **Regular Review:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of `search_data` methods to maintain accuracy and security.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data indexing, protecting it from unauthorized access via search.
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Reduces unintentional exposure of internal data or metadata.
    *   **Enumeration Attacks (Medium Severity):** Limits indexed fields, hindering attackers from enumerating internal IDs or other data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).
    *   **Enumeration Attacks:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `app/models/product.rb` - `search_data` includes only `name`, `description`, and `public_category`.
    *   Example: `app/models/user.rb` - `search_data` includes only `username` and `public_profile`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `app/models/order.rb` - Uses `attributes` in `search_data`, exposing all order details. Needs refactoring to whitelist fields.
    *   Example: `app/models/internal_document.rb` - `searchkick` enabled, but no `search_data` defined (indexes all attributes by default). Requires immediate attention.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Field-Level Permissions within `search_data`](./mitigation_strategies/field-level_permissions_within__search_data_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Conditionally include data in the `search_data` method based on user permissions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields:** In Searchkick-enabled models, identify fields searchable only by specific users/roles.
    2.  **Access Current User:** Access the currently logged-in user within the `search_data` method (e.g., using `Current.user`).
    3.  **Conditional Inclusion:** Use conditional logic (`if`, `unless`) within `search_data` to include sensitive fields *only* if the user has the required permissions.
    4.  **Example:**
        ```ruby
        def search_data
          data = { name: name, description: description }
          data[:internal_notes] = internal_notes if Current.user&.admin?
          data
        end
        ```
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Write tests to verify the conditional logic and ensure sensitive fields are indexed only for authorized users.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from searching and accessing restricted data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users accessing information beyond their authorization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `app/models/product.rb` - `internal_notes` indexed only for admin users.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `app/models/report.rb` - `confidential_summary` indexed for all users. Update to index only for users with specific permissions (e.g., "report_viewer" role).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits (using `body_options`)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits__using__body_options__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit query complexity and resource consumption using Searchkick's `body_options`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Search Entry Points:** Determine where users initiate searches (e.g., controller actions).
    2.  **Use `body_options`:** When calling `Model.search`, use the `body_options` parameter.
    3.  **`size` Limit:** Set a reasonable maximum number of results (`size`). Avoid unlimited results.
    4.  **`timeout` Limit:** Set a timeout (e.g., `1s`, `500ms`) to prevent queries from running indefinitely.
    5.  **Example:**
        ```ruby
        Product.search("query", body_options: { size: 50, timeout: "1s" })
        ```
    6.  **Monitor Performance:** Regularly monitor Elasticsearch performance to identify slow or resource-intensive queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming Elasticsearch with complex queries.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of slow queries consuming excessive resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` - `search` action uses `body_options: { size: 100, timeout: "2s" }`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `app/controllers/reports_controller.rb` - `search` action doesn't use `body_options`. Needs `size` and `timeout` limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Raw Queries / Use Parameterized Queries (Within Searchkick)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_raw_queries__use_parameterized_queries__within_searchkick_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Prioritize Searchkick's API; if raw queries are unavoidable, use parameterized queries.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Searchkick Methods:** Whenever possible, use Searchkick's built-in methods (e.g., `where`, `order`, `aggs`) instead of constructing raw Elasticsearch queries as strings.
    2.  **Parameterized Queries (If Necessary):** If you *must* use raw queries within `body_options` or other advanced features, use parameterized queries (placeholders) instead of string concatenation to prevent injection. Consult Elasticsearch documentation for the correct syntax.
    3. **Review Existing Code:** Examine your codebase for any instances where raw Elasticsearch queries are constructed, especially within `body_options` or custom aggregations. Refactor these to use Searchkick's API or parameterized queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection (Low Severity, but potentially High Impact):** Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious code into Elasticsearch queries.  This is less likely with proper Searchkick usage but crucial if using raw queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact, low probability with correct Searchkick API usage).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Most search functionality uses Searchkick's built-in methods.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A custom aggregation in `app/models/product.rb` uses string concatenation to build a raw query. This needs to be refactored to use parameterized queries or Searchkick's aggregation API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization (Influencing Searchkick Queries)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization__influencing_searchkick_queries_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and sanitize user input that is passed into Searchkick methods.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Determine all places where user input influences Searchkick queries (search forms, API parameters).
    2.  **Length Limits:** Restrict the maximum length of search terms to prevent overly long queries.
    3.  **Character Whitelisting:** Define a whitelist of allowed characters for search terms. Consider alphanumeric characters, spaces, and limited punctuation.
    4.  **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of search terms.
    5.  **Example (Length Limit):**
        ```ruby
        query = params[:q].presence || ""
        query = query[0, 100] # Limit to 100 characters
        ```
    6.  **Example (Character Whitelisting - Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        # Only allow alphanumeric characters and spaces
        if query =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/
          # Proceed with search using Searchkick
        else
          # Handle invalid input
        end
        ```
    7. **Test Thoroughly:** Write tests to verify input validation and sanitization.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents crafted inputs from creating overly complex queries.
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection (Low Severity, but potentially High Impact):** Provides an additional layer of defense, especially if custom query logic is used.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity in this context):** While Searchkick handles basic escaping, input sanitization adds defense.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection:** Provides additional risk reduction (High impact, low probability).
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Small additional risk reduction (Low impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` - `search` action limits query length.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: No character whitelisting or regex validation for search terms.
    *   Example: `app/controllers/reports_controller.rb` - `search` action lacks input sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Searchkick Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_searchkick_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update the Searchkick gem to the latest stable version.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Bundler:** Use Bundler (`Gemfile`) to manage your Ruby dependencies.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Run `bundle update searchkick` periodically (e.g., monthly) to update Searchkick.
    3.  **Version Constraints:** Use pessimistic version constraints (e.g., `gem 'searchkick', '~> 5.0'`) in your `Gemfile`.
    4.  **Changelog Review:** Before updating, review the Searchkick changelog for security fixes.
    5.  **Test After Updates:** Thoroughly test your application after updating Searchkick.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Protects against known vulnerabilities in the Searchkick library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `Gemfile` uses pessimistic version constraints for `searchkick`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Updates are not performed regularly; the project is several minor versions behind.
