# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2a1. Unsanitized Input (XSS via Data Source)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized user input used within Chartkick charts.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation strategies, and provide concrete recommendations to the development team to eliminate or significantly reduce this risk.  This analysis will go beyond a simple vulnerability scan and delve into the code interaction between the application and Chartkick.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Chartkick Integration:** How the application utilizes the Chartkick library (https://github.com/ankane/chartkick) to generate charts.  We will examine the specific Chartkick methods used (e.g., `line_chart`, `bar_chart`, `pie_chart`, etc.) and how data is passed to these methods.
*   **Data Sources:**  Identification of all potential sources of data used to populate Chartkick charts.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   User input fields (forms, search bars, URL parameters).
    *   Database queries that retrieve data based on user input.
    *   API calls to external services that might be influenced by user actions.
    *   Data imported from files (CSV, JSON, etc.) uploaded by users.
*   **Data Handling:**  How the application processes and transforms data *before* it is passed to Chartkick.  This is the crucial area where sanitization should occur.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:**  Understanding how Chartkick and its underlying charting library (Chart.js, Google Charts, or Highcharts) render the data in the user's browser.  This helps pinpoint where the XSS payload would be executed.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential XSS vulnerabilities outside the context of Chartkick chart generation.  General application security best practices are assumed but not explicitly reviewed here.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the application's source code (server-side and client-side) to trace the flow of data from input sources to Chartkick functions.
    *   Identify any instances where user-provided data is directly used in chart data (labels, tooltips, data values) without proper sanitization.
    *   Analyze the use of any templating engines (e.g., ERB, HAML, Jinja2) and how they handle user input within chart-related code.
    *   Review any custom JavaScript code that interacts with Chartkick or the underlying charting library.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Craft specific XSS payloads and attempt to inject them into the application through identified input vectors.  Observe the behavior of the application and the generated charts.  Examples of payloads:
        *   `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` (Basic test)
        *   `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` (Image-based)
        *   `<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>` (SVG-based)
        *   `javascript:alert('XSS')` (in contexts where URLs might be used)
        *   Payloads designed to steal cookies or redirect users.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Utilize web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.  However, manual verification is crucial, as scanners can produce false positives or miss subtle vulnerabilities.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools:**  Inspect the generated HTML and JavaScript code in the browser's developer tools to understand how the chart data is rendered and where the XSS payload is executed.

3.  **Chartkick Library Analysis:**
    *   Review the Chartkick documentation and source code to understand its built-in security features (if any) and potential limitations.
    *   Investigate how Chartkick handles data escaping for different charting libraries (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts).  This is crucial because Chartkick itself might not perform sufficient sanitization, relying on the underlying library.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Consider different attacker scenarios and motivations.  For example, an attacker might try to deface the website, steal user data, or redirect users to malicious sites.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2a1. Unsanitized Input (XSS via Data Source)

This section details the specific analysis of the identified attack path.

**4.1. Attack Scenario:**

An attacker identifies a web application feature where user input is used to populate a Chartkick chart.  For example, a user might be able to enter a "project name" that is then displayed as a label on a bar chart showing project progress.  The attacker enters a malicious project name containing an XSS payload, such as:

```
Project A<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

If the application does not sanitize this input, the payload will be included in the chart data and executed when the chart is rendered in another user's browser.

**4.2. Code Review Findings (Hypothetical Examples):**

Let's consider a few hypothetical code examples (using Ruby on Rails, a common framework for Chartkick) to illustrate potential vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerable Example 1 (Direct Input):**

```ruby
# Controller
def show_chart
  @project_name = params[:project_name] # Directly from user input
  @data = { @project_name => 50 }
end

# View (ERB)
<%= line_chart @data %>
```

This is highly vulnerable.  The `project_name` parameter is taken directly from user input without any sanitization and used as a key in the `@data` hash, which is then passed to `line_chart`.

**Vulnerable Example 2 (Insufficient Sanitization):**

```ruby
# Controller
def show_chart
  @project_name = params[:project_name].gsub('<', '&lt;') # Only replaces '<'
  @data = { @project_name => 50 }
end

# View (ERB)
<%= line_chart @data %>
```

This is still vulnerable.  While the code attempts to sanitize by replacing `<`, it doesn't handle other characters like `>`, `"`, `'`, or `&`, which can be used in XSS payloads.  An attacker could use an image-based payload like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.

**Vulnerable Example 3 (Database Interaction):**

```ruby
# Controller
def show_chart
  @project = Project.find(params[:id]) # Project name might be stored unsanitized
  @data = { @project.name => @project.progress }
end

# View (ERB)
<%= bar_chart @data %>
```

This is vulnerable if the `Project.name` attribute was not properly sanitized when it was *originally saved* to the database.  This highlights the importance of sanitizing data at the point of entry, not just before rendering.

**Safe Example (Proper Sanitization):**

```ruby
# Controller
def show_chart
  @project_name = helpers.sanitize(params[:project_name]) # Use a robust sanitization helper
  @data = { @project_name => 50 }
end

# View (ERB)
<%= line_chart @data %>
```

This is much safer.  The `helpers.sanitize` method (assuming it's a well-implemented sanitization function like Rails' `sanitize` helper) will properly escape or remove dangerous characters, preventing XSS.

**4.3. Dynamic Analysis (Testing Results):**

During dynamic analysis, we would attempt to inject various XSS payloads through all identified input fields that could influence chart data.  We would expect to see the following:

*   **Vulnerable Fields:**  The injected JavaScript code would execute, displaying an alert box or performing other malicious actions.  The browser's developer tools would show the payload embedded within the chart's HTML.
*   **Sanitized Fields:**  The injected payload would be rendered as plain text, not executed as code.  The browser's developer tools would show the payload escaped (e.g., `<script>` would become `&lt;script&gt;`).

**4.4. Chartkick Library Analysis Findings:**

Chartkick itself primarily acts as a wrapper around other charting libraries.  It does *not* perform extensive input sanitization.  The responsibility for sanitization falls on:

1.  **The underlying charting library:** Chart.js, Google Charts, and Highcharts have varying levels of built-in XSS protection.  Some might automatically escape certain characters in labels or tooltips, but this should *not* be relied upon as the sole defense.  Thorough testing is required.
2.  **The application developer:**  This is the most critical point.  The application *must* sanitize all user-provided data before passing it to Chartkick, regardless of the underlying charting library's behavior.

**4.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in Chartkick-based applications:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Whenever possible, define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for user input.  For example, if a field is expected to contain only alphanumeric characters, reject any input that contains other characters.
    *   **Robust Sanitization Library:**  Use a well-tested and maintained sanitization library (e.g., Rails' `sanitize` helper, OWASP Java Encoder, DOMPurify for client-side JavaScript).  Avoid writing custom sanitization functions, as they are prone to errors.
    *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  Understand the context in which the data will be used.  For example, if data will be used in an HTML attribute, use attribute-specific escaping.
    *   **Sanitize on Input:**  Sanitize data as soon as it is received from the user, *before* it is stored in the database or used in any other part of the application.

2.  **Output Encoding:**
    *   Even with input sanitization, it's good practice to encode data when it is displayed in the user interface.  This provides an additional layer of defense.  Use appropriate encoding functions for the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).  A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of injected scripts, even if they bypass input sanitization.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities, including XSS.

5.  **Keep Libraries Updated:**
    *   Regularly update Chartkick and its underlying charting library (Chart.js, Google Charts, or Highcharts) to the latest versions.  Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.

6.  **Educate Developers:**
    *   Ensure that all developers working on the application are aware of XSS vulnerabilities and the importance of proper input sanitization and output encoding.

## 5. Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are made to the development team:

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   Review all code that uses Chartkick and identify any instances where user-provided data is used without proper sanitization.
    *   Implement robust input sanitization using a trusted library (e.g., Rails' `sanitize` helper) for all user-provided data that is used in Chartkick charts.
    *   Test the changes thoroughly using both manual and automated testing techniques.

2.  **Short-Term Actions:**
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the application, focusing on XSS and other common web vulnerabilities.

3.  **Long-Term Actions:**
    *   Establish a secure coding policy that includes guidelines for input validation, sanitization, and output encoding.
    *   Provide regular security training to all developers.
    *   Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in their Chartkick-based application and protect their users from potential attacks.
