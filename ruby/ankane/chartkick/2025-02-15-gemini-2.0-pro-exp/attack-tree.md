## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 1b. Bypass Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1b__bypass_input_validation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root of many data manipulation attacks. If an attacker can bypass input validation, they can inject malicious data into the system. This is a *critical* node because it's a prerequisite for many other attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Many applications fail to implement robust server-side validation.
*   **Impact:** Medium.  The impact depends on the type of data being manipulated, but it can lead to incorrect chart data, potentially misleading users or causing operational issues.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Bypassing client-side validation is trivial, and if server-side validation is weak or absent, no special tools are needed.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic understanding of web requests and browser developer tools is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Proper logging and monitoring of input data can detect attempts to bypass validation.  Lack of server-side validation is easily found in code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1b1. Lack of Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1b1__lack_of_input_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The application does not perform any validation on data before passing it to Chartkick. This is a direct consequence of the "Bypass Input Validation" node.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  This is a common oversight in application development.
*   **Impact:** Medium.  Allows attackers to inject arbitrary data, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Effort:** Low.  The attacker simply needs to provide malicious input.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  No specialized skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Code reviews and penetration testing can easily identify this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1b2. Bypass Client-Side Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1b2__bypass_client-side_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies solely on client-side validation, which can be easily disabled or manipulated by the attacker.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Client-side validation is often used for user experience, but it's not a security control.
*   **Impact:** Medium.  Allows attackers to inject arbitrary data, similar to 1b1.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Can be bypassed using browser developer tools or by intercepting and modifying requests.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic understanding of web technologies is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Relies on server-side validation to detect, as client-side validation is bypassed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 2a. Inject via Data Source](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2a__inject_via_data_source.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector for XSS vulnerabilities within Chartkick.  If the data source contains unsanitized user input, it can be exploited. This is *critical* because XSS is a high-impact vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on how user input is handled and whether it's used in chart data.
*   **Impact:** High.  XSS can lead to complete account compromise, data theft, and session hijacking.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Requires identifying an input field that is reflected in the chart without proper sanitization.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires understanding of XSS vulnerabilities and how to craft payloads.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Web application firewalls (WAFs) and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can often detect XSS attempts, but sophisticated attacks can bypass them.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2a1. Unsanitized Input (XSS via Data Source)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2a1__unsanitized_input__xss_via_data_source_.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided data (or data from any untrusted source) is directly used in the chart data (e.g., labels, tooltips) without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  This is a common vulnerability if developers are not careful about sanitizing user input.
*   **Impact:** High.  Allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Requires finding an input field that is reflected in the chart.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires knowledge of XSS payloads.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Can be detected with web application scanners and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2a2. Unescaped Output in Data (XSS within Chartkick)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2a2__unescaped_output_in_data__xss_within_chartkick_.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the input is sanitized, if Chartkick itself doesn't properly escape the data before rendering it, an XSS vulnerability could exist within the library.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. Reputable libraries like Chartkick are usually well-vetted, but vulnerabilities can still be found.
*   **Impact:** High. Same as 2a1 - arbitrary JavaScript execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires finding a vulnerability in Chartkick's escaping logic.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of XSS and potentially reverse-engineering Chartkick.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires specialized testing targeting Chartkick's rendering logic.
