## Mitigation Strategy: [Chartkick Options Review and Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/chartkick_options_review_and_least_privilege.md)

Okay, here's a refined list focusing *exclusively* on mitigation strategies that directly involve Chartkick's configuration and usage, removing those that are primarily about general data handling *before* it reaches Chartkick. This is a much shorter list, as Chartkick's primary role is presentation.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Chartkick Options Review and Least Privilege

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Document Used Options:** Create a comprehensive list of *all* Chartkick options being used across your application.  This includes options passed directly to Chartkick, as well as any options being passed through to the underlying charting library (Chart.js, Highcharts, or Google Charts).
        2.  **Justify Each Option:** For *each* option in the list, write a clear and concise justification for its use.  Explain why it's necessary for the chart's intended functionality and appearance.
        3.  **Remove Unnecessary Options:**  Identify and remove any options that are not strictly required.  Default settings are often sufficient, and unnecessary customization can introduce complexity and potential issues.  The principle of least privilege applies: only enable what you absolutely need.
        4.  **Review Underlying Library Options:** If Chartkick is passing options through to the underlying charting library, consult the documentation for *that* library (Chart.js, Highcharts, or Google Charts).  Ensure you understand the security implications of each option being passed through.  Avoid using options known to be insecure or deprecated.
        5.  **Regular Review:**  Establish a schedule (e.g., quarterly, after major releases) to review the list of used options and repeat the justification process.  This ensures that the configuration remains minimal and secure over time.
        6.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test *all* chart configurations, including edge cases and a variety of input data.  This helps identify any unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities resulting from specific option combinations.  Pay particular attention to options that control user interaction (e.g., tooltips, events).
        7. **Avoid Dynamic Option Generation (if possible):** If options are being generated dynamically based on user input or other external data, *strictly* validate and sanitize that input *before* using it to construct Chartkick options. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious options. Prefer static configuration whenever feasible.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Misuse of Chartkick Options:** (Severity: Low to Medium) - Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior, potential vulnerabilities, or data exposure due to incorrect or unnecessary configurations.  This is the primary threat this strategy addresses.
        *   **Data Leakage (Partial):** (Severity: Low) - Helps prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive data through misconfigured options, such as overly verbose tooltips or labels.  This is a secondary benefit.
        * **XSS (Indirectly, via underlying library):** (Severity: Low) While Chartkick itself doesn't directly handle rendering, misconfigured options passed to the underlying library *could* potentially create an XSS vulnerability. This mitigation helps prevent that.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Misuse of Chartkick Options:** Risk significantly reduced by ensuring only necessary and well-understood options are used.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Minor risk reduction, as a secondary benefit of careful option selection.
        *   **XSS (Indirectly):** Low, but helps to prevent vulnerabilities introduced through the underlying charting library.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic review of options was performed during the initial implementation of each chart.  Developers generally avoided unnecessary options.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal, documented list of all Chartkick options in use across the application.
        *   No established process for regular review and justification of options.
        *   No specific testing focused on edge cases and potential security implications of option combinations.
        * Dynamic option generation is used in one area (the "Custom Reports" section) without sufficient validation.

This revised list focuses solely on actions directly related to Chartkick's configuration, making it more specific and actionable within the context of Chartkick itself. The key is to treat Chartkick's options as a potential attack surface, albeit a small one, and apply the principle of least privilege.
