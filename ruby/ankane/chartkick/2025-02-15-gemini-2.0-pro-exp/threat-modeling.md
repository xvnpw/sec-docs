# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Threat: [Threat 1: Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Chartkick or Dependencies](./threats/threat_1_exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_chartkick_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability in Chartkick itself, or in one of its underlying charting libraries (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts). The attacker might craft specific input data or chart options that trigger the vulnerability. This is a supply chain attack, and the vulnerability *resides within* Chartkick or its dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (most likely impact).
        *   Potential data leakage.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution (less likely, but possible depending on the underlying library's vulnerability).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Chartkick library and its dependencies (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts). Specific vulnerable functions or modules would depend on the nature of the discovered vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update Chartkick and *all* its dependencies to the latest patched versions. Use dependency management tools (npm, yarn) to track and manage versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (CVE, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) for Chartkick and its dependencies.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Library Alternatives:** If a critical vulnerability is discovered and remains unpatched for an extended period, consider switching to a different charting library.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Data Leakage through Chart Options/Tooltips (If Sensitive Data is Used)](./threats/threat_2_data_leakage_through_chart_optionstooltips__if_sensitive_data_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is inadvertently included in chart options, tooltips, labels, or other configuration settings *passed directly to Chartkick*. This data might be exposed to unauthorized users, even if the main chart data is protected by authentication. This is a direct threat because the leakage occurs through Chartkick's configuration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data confidentiality breach.
        *   Potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Primarily affects chart options and tooltip configurations across all Chartkick chart types. The specific options and properties that could leak data depend on the charting library used (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts) and how Chartkick exposes them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Chart Configurations:** Carefully review all chart options and configurations *before passing them to Chartkick* to ensure that no sensitive data is unintentionally included.
        *   **Sanitize Tooltip Content:** If tooltips are dynamically generated, sanitize the content *before passing it to Chartkick's tooltip configuration* to prevent the display of sensitive information.
        *   **Controlled Data Formatting:** Use a dedicated formatting function to prepare data for tooltips and labels, ensuring that only the necessary, non-sensitive information is included. Avoid directly binding raw data to Chartkick's configuration.
