Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Data Leakage through Chart Options/Tooltips" threat for the application using Chartkick.

## Deep Analysis: Data Leakage through Chart Options/Tooltips (Chartkick)

### 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which sensitive data could leak through Chartkick's configuration options and tooltips, identify specific vulnerable areas within the application's codebase, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to move beyond the general mitigation strategies in the threat model and provide specific guidance for the development team.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **All Chartkick chart types:**  Line, bar, pie, area, column, scatter, geo, timeline, and any custom charts built using Chartkick's underlying libraries.
*   **All Chartkick configuration options:**  This includes options passed directly to Chartkick, as well as options that Chartkick passes through to the underlying charting libraries (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts).  We need to consider the API surface of all three libraries.
*   **Data sources:**  How data is fetched, processed, and formatted *before* being passed to Chartkick.
*   **Tooltip generation:**  How tooltips are generated, both statically and dynamically.  This includes custom tooltip implementations.
*   **Client-side vs. Server-side rendering:**  Understanding where the chart configuration is assembled (client or server) is crucial.
*   **JavaScript code:**  The application's JavaScript code that interacts with Chartkick.
*   **Ruby/Rails code (if applicable):** If Chartkick is used within a Ruby on Rails application, the server-side code generating the chart data and options is in scope.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   General network security issues (e.g., HTTPS configuration).  We assume HTTPS is correctly implemented.
*   Database security.  We assume the database itself is secure.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms *unrelated* to Chartkick. We assume a user is already authenticated; the threat is about leaking data *to* an authenticated user who shouldn't see it.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Chartkick API Review:**  Examine the Chartkick documentation and source code to identify all configuration options related to tooltips, labels, and other display elements.  Pay close attention to how Chartkick handles data formatting and escaping.
2.  **Underlying Library API Review:**  Examine the documentation for Chart.js, Google Charts, and Highcharts to understand their tooltip and data formatting options.  Identify any options that could be used to inject or expose data.  Specifically look for:
    *   Tooltip formatters (functions that control tooltip content).
    *   Label formatters.
    *   Custom properties that can be attached to data points.
    *   Event handlers that might expose data.
3.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Search the application's codebase for all instances of Chartkick usage.  Analyze:
    *   How data is passed to Chartkick.
    *   How tooltips are configured.
    *   Any custom formatting functions used.
    *   Where sensitive data originates and how it flows through the application.
    *   Use of `raw` or `html_safe` (in Rails) which could bypass escaping.
4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Create test cases that attempt to inject sensitive data into chart options and tooltips.
    *   Use browser developer tools to inspect the generated HTML and JavaScript to see if sensitive data is exposed.
    *   Test with different chart types and configurations.
    *   Test with different underlying charting libraries.
    *   Test edge cases, such as very long strings, special characters, and HTML/JavaScript code.
5.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, pinpoint specific lines of code or configuration patterns that are vulnerable to data leakage.
6.  **Remediation Recommendations:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for fixing the identified vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Chartkick and Underlying Library API Review

*   **Chartkick:** Chartkick itself provides a relatively simple API.  The key areas of concern are:
    *   `data`: The primary data source for the chart.  If this contains sensitive data *not intended for display*, it could be leaked through tooltips or labels.
    *   `library`:  This option allows passing options *directly* to the underlying charting library.  This is a major potential source of leakage, as it bypasses Chartkick's (limited) sanitization.
    *   `messages`: Used for customizing loading messages, error messages, etc.  Less likely to be a source of data leakage, but should still be reviewed.
    *   `dataset`: Allows for customization of individual datasets, including colors, labels, etc.

*   **Underlying Libraries (Examples - focusing on tooltips):**

    *   **Chart.js:**
        *   `options.plugins.tooltip.callbacks.label`:  A function that controls the content of the tooltip label.  This is a *critical* area for review.  If this function accesses raw data, it could leak sensitive information.
        *   `options.plugins.tooltip.callbacks.title`: Controls the tooltip title.
        *   `options.plugins.tooltip.callbacks.footer`: Controls the tooltip footer.
        *   `data.datasets[].data[].customProperty`:  Chart.js allows adding custom properties to data points.  These could be exposed in tooltips.

    *   **Google Charts:**
        *   `tooltip.isHtml`:  If set to `true`, allows HTML in tooltips.  This is a *major* risk if the tooltip content is not properly sanitized.
        *   Data Table roles:  The `tooltip` role allows specifying a custom tooltip for each data point.
        *   `hAxis.format`, `vAxis.format`:  Formatting options for axis labels.

    *   **Highcharts:**
        *   `tooltip.formatter`:  A function that controls the entire tooltip content.  This is a *critical* area for review.
        *   `tooltip.pointFormat`:  A string template for the tooltip content.
        *   `series.data.tooltip`: Allows specifying custom tooltip options for individual data points.

#### 4.2 Code Review (Static Analysis - Hypothetical Examples)

Let's consider some hypothetical code examples and analyze their potential vulnerabilities:

**Example 1 (Ruby on Rails, Vulnerable):**

```ruby
# Controller
@users = User.all # Assume User model has sensitive fields like 'ssn', 'internal_notes'
@chart_data = @users.map { |user| { name: user.name, value: user.sales, user: user } }

# View
<%= line_chart @chart_data, library: { plugins: { tooltip: { callbacks: { label: (context) => { return context.raw.user.name + ' (' + context.raw.user.internal_notes + ')'; } } } } } %>
```

**Vulnerability:** This code is *highly vulnerable*. It passes the entire `User` object into the chart data, and then the tooltip callback accesses the `internal_notes` attribute directly.  This exposes sensitive information in the tooltip.  The use of `context.raw` bypasses any escaping.

**Example 2 (JavaScript, Vulnerable):**

```javascript
const data = [
  { name: 'User 1', value: 10, secret: 'confidential_data' },
  { name: 'User 2', value: 20, secret: 'more_secrets' }
];

new Chartkick.LineChart("chart", data, {
  library: {
    plugins: {
      tooltip: {
        callbacks: {
          label: function(context) {
            return context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].name + ': ' + context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].secret;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Vulnerability:** Similar to Example 1, this code directly includes a `secret` property in the data and then exposes it in the tooltip callback.

**Example 3 (Ruby on Rails, Less Vulnerable but Still Risky):**

```ruby
# Controller
@users = User.all
@chart_data = @users.map { |user| { name: user.name, value: user.sales } }

# View
<%= line_chart @chart_data, library: { tooltips: { enabled: true } } %>
```

**Vulnerability:** This code is less vulnerable because it doesn't explicitly expose sensitive data in the tooltip callback.  However, it *still relies on the default tooltip behavior* of the underlying charting library.  If the default behavior includes displaying all properties of the data point, and if the `User` object has been inadvertently modified to include sensitive data, it could still be leaked.  This highlights the importance of *explicitly controlling* tooltip content.

**Example 4 (JavaScript, Mitigated):**

```javascript
const data = [
  { name: 'User 1', value: 10, secret: 'confidential_data' },
  { name: 'User 2', value: 20, secret: 'more_secrets' }
];

// Sanitize the data for the chart
const chartData = data.map(item => ({
  name: item.name,
  value: item.value
}));

new Chartkick.LineChart("chart", chartData, {
  library: {
    plugins: {
      tooltip: {
        callbacks: {
          label: function(context) {
            // Only display the name and value
            return context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].name + ': ' + context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].value;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Mitigation:** This code is significantly improved.  It creates a new `chartData` array that *only* includes the necessary, non-sensitive fields.  The tooltip callback then only accesses these safe fields.

**Example 5 (Ruby on Rails, Mitigated):**

```ruby
# Controller
@users = User.all
@chart_data = @users.map { |user| { name: user.name, value: user.sales } }

# View
<%= line_chart @chart_data, library: { plugins: { tooltip: { callbacks: { label: (context) => { return context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].name + ': ' + context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].value; } } } } } %>
```

**Mitigation:** This code explicitly defines the tooltip callback to only include the `name` and `value` properties, preventing any other data from being leaked.  It's also important that `@chart_data` only contains the necessary fields.

#### 4.3 Dynamic Analysis (Testing)

Dynamic analysis would involve:

1.  **Creating Charts:**  Set up various Chartkick charts with different configurations and data.
2.  **Injecting Data:**  Try to include sensitive data (e.g., simulated PII, internal IDs) in the data passed to Chartkick.
3.  **Inspecting Tooltips:**  Hover over the chart elements to trigger tooltips.  Use the browser's developer tools (Network and Elements tabs) to:
    *   Examine the HTML of the tooltip to see if the sensitive data is present.
    *   Inspect the JavaScript variables and objects to see if the sensitive data is accessible.
    *   Check the network requests to see if the sensitive data is being sent to the server unnecessarily.
4.  **Testing Different Libraries:**  Repeat the tests with Chart.js, Google Charts, and Highcharts as the underlying library.
5.  **Testing Edge Cases:**  Test with long strings, special characters, and HTML/JavaScript code in the data to see if they are properly escaped.

#### 4.4 Vulnerability Identification

Based on the static and dynamic analysis, we would identify specific vulnerabilities.  For example:

*   **Vulnerability 1:**  `app/controllers/reports_controller.rb`, line 42:  The `@chart_data` variable includes the entire `User` object, potentially exposing sensitive fields.
*   **Vulnerability 2:**  `app/assets/javascripts/charts.js`, line 15:  The tooltip callback function accesses `context.raw.user`, bypassing escaping and exposing all user attributes.
*   **Vulnerability 3:** `app/views/reports/show.html.erb`, line 10: Uses `library: { tooltips: { isHtml: true } }` with Google Charts without sanitizing the tooltip content.

#### 4.5 Remediation Recommendations

For each identified vulnerability, we provide specific recommendations:

*   **Remediation for Vulnerability 1:**  Modify `app/controllers/reports_controller.rb`, line 42, to create a new data structure that only includes the necessary fields for the chart:

    ```ruby
    @chart_data = @users.map { |user| { name: user.name, value: user.sales, id: user.id } } # Only include name, sales, and id
    ```

*   **Remediation for Vulnerability 2:**  Modify `app/assets/javascripts/charts.js`, line 15, to access only the safe fields and avoid using `context.raw`:

    ```javascript
    label: function(context) {
      return context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].name + ': ' + context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex].value;
    }
    ```

*   **Remediation for Vulnerability 3:** Remove `isHtml: true` or implement robust HTML sanitization before passing data to the tooltip. If using Rails, consider using the `sanitize` helper *with a strict whitelist of allowed tags and attributes*.  A better approach is to avoid HTML tooltips altogether if possible.

    ```ruby
    # Option 1: Remove isHtml (preferred)
    <%= line_chart @chart_data, library: { tooltips: { enabled: true } } %>

    # Option 2: Sanitize (less preferred, requires careful configuration)
    <%= line_chart @chart_data, library: { tooltips: { isHtml: true, callbacks: { label: (context) => { return sanitize(generate_tooltip_html(context.dataset.data[context.dataIndex]), tags: %w(b i), attributes: []) } } } } %>
    ```
    Where `generate_tooltip_html` is a helper method that generates the HTML, and `sanitize` is used with a very restrictive whitelist.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Data Minimization:**  Always create a separate data structure specifically for the chart, containing only the minimum required data.  Do *not* pass entire model objects (like ActiveRecord objects in Rails) directly to Chartkick.
*   **Explicit Tooltip Control:**  Always define custom tooltip callbacks (e.g., `label`, `title`, `formatter`) to explicitly control the content of the tooltip.  Do *not* rely on the default tooltip behavior of the underlying charting library.
*   **Sanitization:**  If you must use HTML in tooltips, sanitize the HTML *before* passing it to Chartkick.  Use a well-vetted sanitization library and configure it with a strict whitelist.
*   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on Chartkick usage and data handling.
*   **Automated Testing:**  Incorporate automated tests that specifically check for data leakage in tooltips.
*   **Input Validation:** Although this threat focuses on data already in the system, remember to always validate and sanitize *all* user inputs to prevent other vulnerabilities like XSS.

### 5. Conclusion

Data leakage through Chartkick's configuration options and tooltips is a serious threat, especially when dealing with sensitive data. By carefully reviewing the Chartkick API, the underlying charting library APIs, and the application's codebase, and by performing thorough dynamic analysis, we can identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities. The key is to minimize the data passed to Chartkick, explicitly control tooltip content, and sanitize any HTML used in tooltips. Following the recommendations outlined in this deep analysis will significantly reduce the risk of data leakage and improve the overall security of the application.
