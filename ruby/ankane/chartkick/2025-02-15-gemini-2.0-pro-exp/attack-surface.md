# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_injection.md)

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the chart data, which is then executed in the context of the victim's browser when the chart is rendered.
    *   **How Chartkick Contributes:** `Chartkick` acts as a conduit, passing *unsanitized* data directly to the underlying JavaScript charting libraries. It's the mechanism by which the malicious data reaches the vulnerable rendering engine.
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as a product name, which is then displayed as a label in a chart. When the chart renders, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, theft of cookies, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Always* rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data *before* passing it to `chartkick`. Use framework-provided sanitization helpers (e.g., `sanitize`, `h` in Rails) or dedicated HTML sanitization libraries.  Ensure sanitization is context-aware.
        *   **Output Encoding:**  Ensure that data is properly encoded when it's rendered in the HTML.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Options Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_chart_options_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into chart *options* (e.g., `title`, `subtitle`, custom JavaScript callbacks).
    *   **How Chartkick Contributes:** `Chartkick` passes these options *directly* to the underlying charting library without sanitization.  It's the direct pathway for the malicious code to reach the rendering engine.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a chart title like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, which is then used in the `title` option.
    *   **Impact:** Same as XSS via data injection: account compromise, session hijacking, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize Options:** Apply the *same* rigorous sanitization and escaping to user-supplied data used in chart *options* as for chart data.
        *   **Avoid User Input in Callbacks:**  Minimize/avoid using user input directly within JavaScript callbacks in chart options. If unavoidable, treat this input as extremely high-risk and sanitize meticulously.
        *   **CSP:** A strong CSP also mitigates this risk.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Underlying Charting Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_underlying_charting_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the JavaScript charting libraries (Chart.js, Google Charts, Highcharts) that `chartkick` uses can be exploited.
    *   **How Chartkick Contributes:** `Chartkick`'s *direct dependency* on these external libraries makes their vulnerabilities a direct part of `chartkick`'s attack surface. `Chartkick` is the component that loads and utilizes these potentially vulnerable libraries.
    *   **Example:** A known XSS vulnerability in an older version of Chart.js is exploited through `chartkick`, even if the application sanitizes its own data.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can include XSS, data breaches, or DoS, depending on the underlying library vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the underlying library vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update `chartkick` *and* the underlying JavaScript charting libraries. Use dependency management tools. Monitor security advisories.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when including the JavaScript charting libraries.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan your application and its dependencies.
