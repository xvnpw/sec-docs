# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a simple and intuitive JavaScript charting library for web developers.
  - Enable developers to quickly create visually appealing charts with minimal code.
  - Support a wide range of chart types and data sources.
  - Offer a lightweight and performant charting solution.
  - Maintain an open-source and community-driven project.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
  - Poor performance or instability of the library could negatively impact user experience in applications that rely on it.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable over time.
  - Incorrect or misleading data visualization due to bugs in the library could lead to flawed business decisions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Relies on standard JavaScript package managers (npm, yarn) for dependency management. Implemented: package.json.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Third-party dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities that could affect Chartkick.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers using Chartkick might implement it insecurely in their applications, leading to vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Lack of Formal Security Audits - As an open-source project, formal security audits might not be regularly conducted.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically detect potential security flaws in the codebase.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews - Conduct regular security-focused code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report issues responsibly.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the Chartkick library itself, as it is a front-end charting library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using Chartkick to secure their data sources and APIs.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to the Chartkick library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using Chartkick to control access to the data being visualized.
  - Input Validation:
    - Important for applications using Chartkick to validate and sanitize data before passing it to Chartkick for rendering, especially if the data originates from user input or external sources. This helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if chart labels or tooltips display unsanitized data.
  - Cryptography:
    - Not directly applicable to the core Chartkick library functionality. Cryptography might be relevant in the context of data transmission and storage in the applications that use Chartkick, but this is outside the scope of the library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Data Visualization: The primary business process is enabling users to visualize data effectively and accurately within web applications. Failure in this process can lead to misinterpretation of data and flawed decision-making.
  - Application Functionality: Applications relying on Chartkick for charting functionality may experience disruptions or errors if the library is compromised or malfunctions.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the applications using Chartkick. Chartkick itself does not handle or store data persistently. The sensitivity of data visualized by Chartkick is determined by the context of the application and the nature of the data being displayed. If applications use Chartkick to visualize sensitive business data, customer information, or financial data, then the potential impact of a security breach related to Chartkick could be significant. However, if Chartkick is used for non-sensitive public data, the risk is lower.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the typical use cases and industries for applications using Chartkick? Understanding the context of use will help prioritize security concerns.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using Chartkick might need to adhere to? This will influence the required security controls.
  - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for the Chartkick library? Long-term support and updates are crucial for security.
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary business goal is to provide a user-friendly and widely adopted charting library.
    - Security is important for maintaining trust and preventing misuse of the library in vulnerable applications.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Security responsibility is shared between the Chartkick library developers and the developers using the library in their applications.
    - Applications using Chartkick are expected to implement their own security controls for authentication, authorization, and data handling.
    - The open-source nature of Chartkick is considered a security benefit through community review, but also presents challenges in terms of formal security processes.
  - DESIGN:
    - Chartkick is primarily a client-side JavaScript library.
    - Data for charts is fetched and processed by the web application before being passed to Chartkick.
    - Deployment typically involves CDN distribution for the library files and integration into web applications deployed on standard web server infrastructure.
    - The build process utilizes common JavaScript build tools and CI/CD practices.
