## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Chart Data](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_chart_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization for Chart Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Chart Data Sources:** Determine all places in your application where user-provided data is used *specifically for generating Chartkick charts*. This includes data for labels, data points, tooltips, and any other chart options that might incorporate user input.
    2.  **Sanitize Before Chartkick:**  Before passing user-provided data to Chartkick for chart creation, apply server-side sanitization. Use a sanitization library or function appropriate for your backend language (e.g., `sanitize` in Ruby on Rails).
    3.  **Focus on XSS Prevention:**  Prioritize sanitizing HTML and JavaScript code that could be injected into chart elements.  Specifically target sanitization for strings used in chart labels, tooltips, and potentially custom formatters if they handle user input.
    4.  **Test with Chart Context:** Test sanitization specifically in the context of Chartkick charts. Attempt to inject XSS payloads through user inputs that feed into chart data and verify that the sanitization effectively prevents script execution within the rendered chart.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Data - Reflected (High Severity):** Malicious scripts injected through user input intended for chart data are immediately executed when the chart is rendered. This is directly related to how Chartkick visualizes data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Data - Stored (High Severity):** Malicious scripts injected through user input for chart data are stored and executed when other users view charts containing this compromised data. This is a risk amplified by using user-influenced data in Chartkick.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via Chart Data - Reflected:** High Risk Reduction - Directly prevents reflected XSS attacks originating from user-controlled chart data.
    *   **XSS via Chart Data - Stored:** High Risk Reduction - Directly prevents stored XSS attacks originating from user-controlled chart data.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  [Describe if input sanitization is currently implemented for data used in Chartkick charts. For example: "Partially implemented for user-provided titles in chart configuration, using Rails `sanitize` helper."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe where input sanitization is missing specifically for Chartkick usage. For example: "Missing sanitization for user comments that are displayed in chart tooltips.", "User-uploaded CSV data used for charts is not sanitized before being processed by Chartkick."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding in Chart Labels and Tooltips](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding_in_chart_labels_and_tooltips.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Output Encoding in Chart Labels and Tooltips
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Chartkick/Charting Library Encoding:** Understand how Chartkick and the underlying charting library (e.g., Chart.js) handle output encoding for chart elements like labels and tooltips.  Most libraries have default encoding to prevent XSS.
    2.  **Review Custom Chart Options:** If you are using custom Chartkick options, especially those affecting labels or tooltips, ensure you are not inadvertently disabling or bypassing default encoding. Check for usage of raw HTML or JavaScript within these options that could lead to XSS.
    3.  **Explicit Encoding for Customizations:** If you are creating custom tooltips or labels using the charting library's API through Chartkick's options, explicitly ensure proper output encoding. Use the charting library's encoding functions or your server-side templating engine's encoding features when generating dynamic content for these elements.
    4.  **Chart-Specific Encoding Tests:** Test output encoding specifically within Chartkick charts. Attempt to inject HTML and JavaScript into chart labels and tooltips (even if data is sanitized server-side) and verify that the charting library correctly encodes these inputs during rendering, preventing script execution in the chart context.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chart Rendering - Reflected (High Severity):** Prevents XSS if server-side sanitization for chart data is missed or bypassed, acting as a client-side defense during chart rendering.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chart Rendering - Stored (High Severity):** Provides an additional layer of defense against stored XSS in chart data, ensuring safe rendering even if data somehow bypasses server-side sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS in Chart Rendering - Reflected:** Medium Risk Reduction - Acts as a crucial secondary defense specifically for XSS risks during chart rendering.
    *   **XSS in Chart Rendering - Stored:** Medium Risk Reduction - Provides an extra layer of protection against stored XSS vulnerabilities that could manifest during chart display.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if output encoding is considered in the context of Chartkick charts. For example: "We rely on Chart.js's default encoding for labels and tooltips in Chartkick charts."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where output encoding needs specific verification or enforcement within Chartkick charts. For example: "Need to verify encoding in custom tooltip functions used with Chartkick.", "Review custom label formatters in Chartkick configurations to ensure they are not introducing raw HTML vulnerabilities."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of Chartkick and Charting Libraries](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_chartkick_and_charting_libraries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Updates of Chartkick and Charting Libraries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Chartkick and Charting Library Updates:** Monitor releases and security advisories for Chartkick and its underlying charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, Highcharts, Google Charts). Pay attention to both the Chartkick Ruby gem and the client-side JavaScript libraries it utilizes.
    2.  **Update Chartkick Gem:** Regularly update the Chartkick Ruby gem using your dependency management tool (e.g., Bundler). Follow standard gem update procedures for your project.
    3.  **Update Client-Side Charting Libraries:** Ensure the client-side charting libraries used by Chartkick are also kept up-to-date. This might involve updating CDN links to point to newer versions or updating package manager dependencies if you manage client-side libraries directly.
    4.  **Chart Functionality Testing After Updates:** After updating Chartkick or charting libraries, specifically test chart rendering and functionality in your application to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced by the updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Chartkick Gem (High to Critical Severity):** Addresses known security vulnerabilities specifically within the Chartkick Ruby gem.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Charting Libraries Used by Chartkick (High to Critical Severity):** Mitigates vulnerabilities in the client-side charting libraries that Chartkick depends on to render charts. These vulnerabilities could be exploited through Chartkick's usage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chartkick and Charting Library Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Proactively addresses known vulnerabilities in Chartkick and its charting library dependencies, reducing the attack surface directly related to charting functionality.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe your current update process for Chartkick and related libraries. For example: "We update Ruby gems monthly, including Chartkick, using `bundle update`."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas for improvement in updating Chartkick and charting libraries. For example: "Client-side Chart.js library updates are not consistently tracked and updated alongside Chartkick gem updates.", "No specific testing focused on chart functionality after Chartkick or charting library updates."]
