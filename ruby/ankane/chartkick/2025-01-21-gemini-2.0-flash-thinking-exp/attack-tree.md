## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Chartkick Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_chartkick_rendering.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the client-side rendering of charts, potentially leading to direct compromise of the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data.md)

This attack vector exploits the failure to properly sanitize data before it's rendered in the chart. An attacker injects malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when the chart is viewed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script through Chart Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_through_chart_data.md)

This is the specific method of injecting the malicious script by embedding it within the data points, labels, or tooltips that are used to generate the chart.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-side fails to sanitize data passed to Chartkick](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_fails_to_sanitize_data_passed_to_chartkick.md)

This is the root cause of the XSS vulnerability. The server-side application does not adequately remove or escape potentially harmful characters from the data before sending it to the client-side Chartkick library for rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Data Handling for Chartkick](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_data_handling_for_chartkick.md)

This category of attacks focuses on vulnerabilities in how the server processes and provides data for the charts, potentially leading to information leaks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Chart Data](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_chart_data.md)

This attack vector involves unintentionally revealing sensitive information through the data displayed in the charts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data in Chart Labels or Tooltips](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_in_chart_labels_or_tooltips.md)

This is a specific way sensitive information can be disclosed, by including it directly in the labels or tooltips that appear on the chart.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-side includes sensitive information in data passed to Chartkick](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_includes_sensitive_information_in_data_passed_to_chartkick.md)

The server-side application is including confidential or private data in the dataset that is sent to the client-side for chart rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of proper data filtering or anonymization](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_proper_data_filtering_or_anonymization.md)

The server-side application fails to remove or mask sensitive information before passing the data to Chartkick, making it visible in the rendered chart.
