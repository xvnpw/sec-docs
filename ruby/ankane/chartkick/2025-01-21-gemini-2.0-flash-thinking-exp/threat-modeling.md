# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data in Chart Labels/Tooltips](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data_in_chart_labelstooltips.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is used to generate chart labels, tooltips, or other text elements rendered by Chartkick. This occurs if the server-side application doesn't properly sanitize data before passing it to Chartkick, and Chartkick's rendering logic doesn't provide sufficient output encoding. When a user views the chart, the malicious script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:**  Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the page, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Chartkick Component:**
    *   `Chartkick.js` (client-side JavaScript responsible for rendering charts)
    *   Data processing logic within `Chartkick.js` that handles labels, tooltips, and other text elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Output Encoding:**  Always encode data on the server-side before passing it to Chartkick, specifically for HTML context.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Regularly Review Data Handling:**  Audit the code that provides data to Chartkick to ensure proper sanitization and encoding practices.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data in Custom HTML Tooltips/Callbacks](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data_in_custom_html_tooltipscallbacks.md)

*   **Description:** If Chartkick is configured to use custom HTML for tooltips or uses callback functions that directly manipulate the DOM with unsanitized data, an attacker can inject malicious scripts. This vulnerability arises from Chartkick's flexibility in allowing custom HTML and the developer's responsibility to sanitize data within these customizations.
*   **Impact:** Same as above (session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, defacement, arbitrary actions).
*   **Affected Chartkick Component:**
    *   `Chartkick.js` (client-side JavaScript)
    *   Configuration options within `Chartkick.js` related to custom tooltips or callback functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Output Encoding:**  Encode all data used within custom HTML tooltips or callback functions on the server-side.
    *   **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation with User Data:** If possible, avoid directly inserting user-provided data into the DOM within callback functions.
    *   **Use Secure Templating Libraries:** If custom HTML is necessary, use secure templating libraries that automatically handle output encoding.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Chartkick](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_chartkick.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the Chartkick library itself (e.g., through a compromised npm package) and inject malicious code. This malicious code would then be included in the application's assets and executed in users' browsers when they load pages using Chartkick.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, as the attacker could gain full control over the client-side execution environment, leading to data theft, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Chartkick Component:**
    *   The entire `Chartkick.js` codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify Package Integrity:** Use checksums or other methods to verify the integrity of the Chartkick package when installing.
    *   **Use Reputable Package Registries:** Obtain Chartkick from trusted package registries like npm.
    *   **Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks.
    *   **Consider Using Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  For CDN-hosted versions of Chartkick, use SRI to ensure that the browser only executes the expected code.
