# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Chart Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_chart_data.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the data used to generate charts. When Chartkick renders the chart, this script executes in the user's browser.

**How Chartkick Contributes:** Chartkick directly renders data provided to it by the backend. If this data isn't properly sanitized on the backend, Chartkick will faithfully display it, including any malicious scripts.

**Example:** A user-controlled field (e.g., a label for a data point) allows input like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. The backend passes this directly to Chartkick, which renders it, causing the alert to pop up in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and other client-side attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Backend-Side Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided data on the backend *before* passing it to Chartkick. Use appropriate escaping functions for the rendering context (e.g., HTML escaping).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   **Output Encoding:** Ensure Chartkick's underlying charting library (e.g., Chart.js) is configured to properly encode output to prevent script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Charting Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_charting_libraries.md)

**Description:** Chartkick relies on third-party JavaScript charting libraries (like Chart.js or Highcharts). These libraries may have their own security vulnerabilities.

**How Chartkick Contributes:** Chartkick acts as a wrapper. If the underlying library has a vulnerability (e.g., a bug in data parsing or rendering), it can be exploited through Chartkick.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in Chart.js allows for arbitrary code execution by crafting specific data structures. An attacker provides data that triggers this vulnerability when rendered by Chartkick.

**Impact:**  Can range from client-side denial of service to potential remote code execution depending on the severity of the underlying library's vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the underlying vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Chartkick and its underlying charting library updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for Chartkick and its dependencies to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If a specific underlying library has a history of vulnerabilities, consider using Chartkick with a different supported library.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Chart Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_chart_data.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently included in the data used to generate charts and is visible to unauthorized users.

**How Chartkick Contributes:** Chartkick displays the data it is given. If the backend provides sensitive data without proper access controls, Chartkick will render it.

**Example:** A chart displaying financial data includes individual user salaries, which are visible to all users viewing the chart.

**Impact:**  Exposure of confidential or private information, potentially leading to privacy violations or security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the sensitivity of the data)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only include necessary data in charts. Avoid displaying sensitive information unless absolutely required and with proper authorization.
*   **Access Controls:** Implement robust access controls on the backend to ensure only authorized users can view charts containing sensitive data.
*   **Data Aggregation/Anonymization:**  Aggregate or anonymize sensitive data before displaying it in charts to protect individual privacy.
