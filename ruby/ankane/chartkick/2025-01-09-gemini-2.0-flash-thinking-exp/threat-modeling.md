# Threat Model Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Threat: [Client-Side Data Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/client-side_data_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data intended for display in a chart on the server-side.
    *   **How:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode this data *before passing it to Chartkick*. When Chartkick renders the chart using its underlying JavaScript charting library, the injected script executes in the user's browser. Chartkick's role is the intermediary that passes unsanitized data to the rendering engine.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Session hijacking (stealing user session cookies).
        *   Credential theft (capturing user login credentials).
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Defacement of the application.
        *   Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Chartkick's data processing and rendering pipeline, specifically the integration point where data is passed from the server-side to the client-side through Chartkick's helpers and then to the underlying JavaScript charting library. The `data` option passed to Chartkick helpers is a key area of concern.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all data that will be displayed in charts *before* passing it to Chartkick.
        *   Utilize context-aware output encoding techniques when rendering chart data on the client-side. Ensure the encoding is appropriate for how Chartkick and the underlying library handle the data.
        *   Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection leading to Malicious Chart Behavior](./threats/configuration_injection_leading_to_malicious_chart_behavior.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates chart configuration options to inject malicious or unexpected settings.
    *   **How:** The application dynamically constructs chart options based on user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization, and then passes these options to Chartkick. Chartkick then passes these potentially malicious configurations to the underlying charting library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Displaying misleading or incorrect data visualizations.
        *   Triggering unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities within the underlying JavaScript charting library due to the malicious configuration.
        *   Causing client-side denial-of-service through resource-intensive or infinite loop configurations that are passed through Chartkick.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Chartkick's configuration handling, specifically how the `options` hash is processed and passed to the underlying JavaScript charting library. This includes the server-side logic that builds this `options` hash before it reaches Chartkick.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing chart options based on untrusted input that will be directly passed to Chartkick.
        *   If dynamic configuration is necessary, implement a strict whitelist of allowed options and validate all input against this whitelist *before* it's used to build the Chartkick `options` hash.
        *   Carefully review the documentation of the underlying JavaScript charting library for potentially dangerous configuration options that could be exploited through Chartkick.
