# Attack Surface Analysis for ankane/chartkick

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data Input](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is used by Chartkick to render charts. When a user views the chart, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**How Chartkick Contributes:** Chartkick directly renders the provided data (labels, data points, tooltips, etc.) onto the web page. If this data is not properly sanitized on the server-side, Chartkick will display the malicious script, leading to its execution.

**Example:**  A website displays a chart of user comments. An attacker submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the application doesn't sanitize this input before passing it to Chartkick for rendering the chart's labels, the alert will execute in other users' browsers viewing the chart.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the web page, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Server-Side Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization and encoding of all data used by Chartkick, especially labels, tooltips, and data points. Use context-aware output encoding appropriate for HTML.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_configuration_options.md)

**Description:**  Certain Chartkick configuration options might allow the inclusion of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. If these options are dynamically set based on unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources, it can lead to XSS.

**How Chartkick Contributes:** Chartkick processes configuration options provided by the developer. If these options allow for embedding raw HTML or JavaScript and this input is not controlled, it becomes a vector for XSS.

**Example:** A configuration option allows custom tooltip formatting using HTML. If a developer allows users to influence this formatting without sanitization, an attacker could inject `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` into the tooltip configuration.

**Impact:** Similar to data input XSS: session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, defacement, arbitrary actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Configuration Control:** Avoid dynamically setting potentially dangerous configuration options based on user input.
* **Sanitize Configuration Input:** If dynamic configuration is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate any user-provided data before using it in Chartkick configuration.
* **Prefer Safe Configuration Options:** Utilize safer configuration options that do not allow for raw HTML or JavaScript embedding if possible.
