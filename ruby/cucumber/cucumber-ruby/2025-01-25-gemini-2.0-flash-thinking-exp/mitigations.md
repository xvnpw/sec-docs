# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Step Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_step_definitions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization in Step Definitions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all step definitions that accept parameters directly from Gherkin feature files.** Review your `step_definitions` directory and pinpoint steps using regular expressions or capture groups (`()`) in their definition to extract data from scenario steps.
    2.  **For each captured parameter, define the expected data type and format within the step definition code.**  Determine the intended data type (string, integer, specific pattern) for each parameter extracted from Gherkin.
    3.  **Implement validation logic *inside* the step definition, immediately after capturing the parameter.** Use Ruby's built-in methods or validation libraries to check if the captured input matches the expected type and format *before* using it in any application logic or external system interaction.
    4.  **Sanitize the validated input *within the step definition* before using it in actions that could be vulnerable.**  Apply sanitization techniques relevant to the context of use within the step definition. For example, if the step definition constructs a database query, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. If it generates output for a web page, use HTML escaping.
    5.  **Implement error handling *within the step definition* for invalid input.** If validation fails, raise a clear error message within the step definition that will cause the Cucumber scenario to fail and provide informative feedback. Avoid silently ignoring invalid input.
    6.  **Regularly review and update validation and sanitization rules in step definitions as feature files and application requirements evolve.** Ensure that as new features and Gherkin steps are added, the corresponding step definitions are updated with appropriate input validation and sanitization.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Malicious input in feature files, when passed to step definitions, could be used to execute arbitrary commands if step definitions use `system()` or backticks without sanitization.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** If step definitions construct SQL queries using string interpolation with unsanitized input from feature files, attackers could inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** If step definitions generate output displayed in web applications based on unsanitized feature file input, attackers could inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** High Risk Reduction - Directly prevents command injection by validating and sanitizing input *before* command execution within step definitions.
    *   **SQL Injection:** High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents SQL injection when using parameterized queries/prepared statements and input validation *within step definitions*.
    *   **XSS:** Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces XSS risk by sanitizing output generated from feature file input *within step definitions*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input validation exists in some step definitions, particularly for user input fields like email and password in user-related steps (`step_definitions/user_steps.rb`).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent input sanitization is lacking across step definitions that interact with databases or external systems. Step definitions in modules like `step_definitions/product_steps.rb` and reporting logic in `support/reporting.rb` need more robust sanitization for data derived from feature files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secret Management for Cucumber Feature Files and Step Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secret_management_for_cucumber_feature_files_and_step_definitions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Secret Management for Cucumber Feature Files and Step Definitions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit all feature files (`.feature`) and step definition files (`.rb` in `step_definitions`) for hardcoded sensitive information.** Search for API keys, passwords, tokens, database credentials, or any other secrets directly embedded in these files.
    2.  **Remove all hardcoded secrets from feature files and step definitions.** Replace them with placeholders or references to externalized secret storage.
    3.  **Utilize environment variables to manage secrets accessed by Cucumber tests.** Configure your test execution environment to set environment variables containing sensitive information. Access these variables within step definitions using `ENV['SECRET_NAME']`. This keeps secrets out of the codebase.
    4.  **For more complex secret management, consider using a dedicated Ruby gem for configuration and secrets.** Gems like `config` or `dotenv` can help manage configuration files and load secrets from `.env` files (which should *not* be committed to version control). Ensure `.env` files are properly excluded from version control (e.g., in `.gitignore`).
    5.  **Avoid passing secrets directly as parameters in Gherkin feature files.**  Do not write scenarios like `Given I use API key "hardcoded_api_key"`. Instead, scenarios should refer to actions or data without revealing the secret itself, and the step definition should retrieve the secret from the secure storage.
    6.  **Document the method used for secret management for Cucumber tests.** Clearly document how secrets are stored, accessed in step definitions, and managed within the Cucumber testing framework for the development team.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of sensitive information if secrets are hardcoded in feature files or step definitions that are stored in version control or accessible to unauthorized individuals.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of accidental secret exposure by removing hardcoded secrets from Cucumber-related files and using secure external storage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database credentials for test environments are managed using environment variables loaded via `config/database.yml` and accessed in database setup step definitions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** API keys for external services used in integration tests are still sometimes found as strings directly within feature files (`features/api_integration.feature`) or step definitions.  A consistent approach using a dedicated configuration gem for all secrets related to Cucumber tests is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Feature File Complexity to Prevent Cucumber Performance Issues](./mitigation_strategies/control_feature_file_complexity_to_prevent_cucumber_performance_issues.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Feature File Complexity to Prevent Cucumber Performance Issues
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish guidelines for feature file complexity specifically for Cucumber.** Define limits on the number of scenarios per feature file, steps per scenario, and overall feature file size to maintain test suite performance and readability within Cucumber.
    2.  **Encourage developers to write focused and concise feature files.** Promote the practice of breaking down large features into smaller, more manageable feature files with fewer scenarios and steps.
    3.  **Regularly review feature files for excessive complexity during code reviews.**  Code reviews should include checks for feature files that are becoming too large or complex, potentially impacting Cucumber execution time and maintainability.
    4.  **If performance issues arise in Cucumber test execution, investigate feature file complexity as a potential cause.** Analyze feature files that are part of slow test runs to identify overly complex scenarios or features that can be simplified or refactored.
    5.  **Consider splitting very large feature files into multiple smaller files.** If a feature file becomes too large, break it down into logical sub-features and create separate feature files for each. This improves organization and can help with Cucumber performance.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity - specifically for test environment):**  Maliciously crafted or unintentionally overly complex feature files could lead to slow test execution times or even resource exhaustion in the test environment during Cucumber runs, effectively causing a DoS of the testing process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Test Environment):** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of performance-related issues and potential DoS in the test environment caused by overly complex Cucumber feature files. Improves overall test suite stability and execution time.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Team coding standards mention keeping feature files concise, but no strict complexity limits are enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No automated tools or processes are in place to enforce feature file complexity limits. No specific monitoring is done to track Cucumber test execution time related to feature file complexity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Coding Practices and Static Analysis for Step Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coding_practices_and_static_analysis_for_step_definitions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Coding Practices and Static Analysis for Step Definitions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Provide secure coding training specifically tailored to writing Cucumber step definitions in Ruby.** Focus training on common vulnerabilities relevant to step definition code, such as input validation, secure interactions with external systems (APIs, databases), and avoiding insecure Ruby practices within the Cucumber context.
    2.  **Establish secure coding guidelines specifically for Cucumber step definitions.** Create a checklist or style guide outlining secure coding practices for step definitions, emphasizing input validation, output encoding, least privilege, and secure API/database interactions within the Cucumber framework.
    3.  **Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to analyze step definition code.** Use Ruby SAST tools like Brakeman or RuboCop with security-focused plugins to automatically scan step definition files (`step_definitions/*.rb`) for potential vulnerabilities during the build process.
    4.  **Configure SAST tools to specifically check for common vulnerabilities in step definitions.**  Tailor SAST tool configurations to detect issues like SQL injection vulnerabilities in database interactions within step definitions, command injection risks, and potential XSS vulnerabilities if step definitions generate output.
    5.  **Enforce code reviews for all changes to step definition code, with a focus on security.** Code reviewers should specifically check for adherence to secure coding guidelines and identify potential vulnerabilities in step definitions before changes are merged.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Step Definition Logic (High Severity):**  General software vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure deserialization, logic flaws, insecure file handling) introduced in step definition code that could be exploited if step definitions are compromised or misused.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Step Definition Logic:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in step definition code by promoting secure coding practices, automated static analysis, and security-focused code reviews specifically for Cucumber step definitions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are mandatory for all code changes, including step definitions. `bundler-audit` is used to check for vulnerable dependencies, which indirectly helps secure step definitions by ensuring dependencies are up-to-date.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No specific secure coding training for Cucumber step definitions has been provided. SAST tools are not currently integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to directly analyze step definition code for vulnerabilities. Security checklists for step definition code reviews are not formally defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Principle of Least Privilege to Step Definition Actions](./mitigation_strategies/apply_principle_of_least_privilege_to_step_definition_actions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Apply Principle of Least Privilege to Step Definition Actions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review each step definition and identify the minimum necessary actions and permissions it requires to perform its testing function.** Determine the specific API calls, database operations, or system interactions each step definition needs.
    2.  **Refactor step definitions to limit their actions to only the strictly necessary operations.** Avoid creating overly broad or generic step definitions that perform actions beyond their immediate testing purpose.
    3.  **If step definitions interact with APIs or databases, ensure they use accounts or roles with the least privileges required.** Configure API clients or database connections within step definitions to use credentials that have only the permissions needed for the specific test actions, not administrative or overly permissive accounts.
    4.  **Avoid granting step definitions unnecessary access to sensitive resources or functionalities.**  Step definitions should only interact with the parts of the system under test that are directly relevant to the scenario being tested.
    5.  **Regularly audit step definitions to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege as the application evolves.** Periodically review step definitions to identify and refactor any steps that have gained unnecessary permissions or are performing actions beyond their intended scope.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Step Definitions (Medium Severity):**  Step definitions with unnecessarily broad permissions could be misused or exploited if feature files or test execution are compromised, potentially leading to unintended actions within the system under test.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Step Definitions:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the potential impact of compromised feature files or test execution by limiting the capabilities and permissions of step definitions to the minimum required for testing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Step definitions are generally designed to be specific to test scenarios, but a formal review for least privilege has not been systematically conducted.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No systematic review and refactoring of step definitions to strictly enforce the principle of least privilege has been performed. No formal documentation of the intended permissions and actions of each step definition exists.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Design Step Definitions for Idempotency and Cleanup within Cucumber Scenarios](./mitigation_strategies/design_step_definitions_for_idempotency_and_cleanup_within_cucumber_scenarios.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Design Step Definitions for Idempotency and Cleanup within Cucumber Scenarios
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Design step definitions to be idempotent whenever feasible within the context of Cucumber tests.**  Aim for step definitions that produce the same outcome regardless of how many times they are executed within a scenario or across multiple scenarios. This reduces unintended side effects from repeated test runs or scenario reruns.
    2.  **Implement cleanup actions *within step definitions* that modify data or system state.** For step definitions that create, update, or delete data, include logic within the step definition itself to revert changes or clean up after the action is performed. This could involve deleting created records, resetting flags, or rolling back transactions.
    3.  **Utilize Cucumber's `After` hooks to implement scenario-level cleanup for actions that span multiple step definitions.** Use `After` hooks in `support/hooks.rb` to define cleanup procedures that are executed after each Cucumber scenario, ensuring that any changes made during the scenario are reverted, even if the scenario fails.
    4.  **Use database transactions within step definitions for database interactions to ensure atomicity and rollback capabilities.** Wrap database operations within transactions so that if a step definition fails or the scenario is interrupted, changes can be rolled back, preventing data inconsistencies.
    5.  **Thoroughly test cleanup procedures implemented in step definitions and `After` hooks to ensure they are effective.** Verify that cleanup actions correctly revert changes and restore the system to a consistent state after Cucumber scenarios are executed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Side Effects of Test Execution (Medium Severity):** Poorly designed step definitions causing data corruption, system instability, or leaving the system in an inconsistent state during Cucumber test runs, potentially impacting subsequent tests or the application's state.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Side Effects of Test Execution:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of unintended side effects by promoting idempotent step definitions and ensuring proper cleanup within step definitions and Cucumber scenario lifecycle, minimizing potential damage or inconsistencies caused by test execution.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database interactions in step definitions generally use transactions. `After` hooks are used for basic cleanup like browser session management and clearing test data in some scenarios.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not all step definitions are designed to be fully idempotent. Cleanup procedures are not consistently implemented for all types of state-changing step definitions, especially those interacting with external APIs or complex system components.  Testing of cleanup procedures is not regularly and systematically performed.
