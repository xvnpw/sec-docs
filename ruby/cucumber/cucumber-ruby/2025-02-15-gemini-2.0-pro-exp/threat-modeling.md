# Threat Model Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Step Definition Injection](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_step_definition_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious feature file or scenario outline example. This input is processed by Cucumber's Gherkin parser (`gherkin` gem, a direct dependency) and then used to match and execute step definitions.  The attacker exploits weaknesses in the regular expression matching logic within `Cucumber::RbSupport::RbStepDefinition#regexp_source_and_comment` or in how parameter type transformations are handled (`Cucumber::ParameterTypeRegistry`) to inject and execute arbitrary Ruby code within the step definition. The attacker's goal is to gain control of the system running the tests.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise (Remote Code Execution - RCE), data exfiltration, privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Cucumber::RbSupport::RbStepDefinition#regexp_source_and_comment` (regular expression handling in step definitions).
        *   `Cucumber::ParameterTypeRegistry` (custom parameter type transformations).
        *   Step definition methods (the Ruby code within `Given`, `When`, `Then` blocks).
        *   `gherkin` gem (parsing of feature files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* data extracted from feature files *before* it reaches the step definition matching logic. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Secure Regular Expressions:** Use anchored regular expressions (`^...$`) in step definitions. Avoid overly permissive regex patterns.
        *   **Avoid `eval`, `system`, `exec`, backticks:** Never use these functions with unsanitized input from feature files.
        *   **Parameterized Steps:** Prefer Cucumber's built-in parameterization (data tables, scenario outlines).
        *   **Custom Parameter Types (with Validation):** If using custom parameter types, ensure they include robust, *internal* validation logic that cannot be bypassed by the attacker.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for all step definitions, with a security focus.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Feature Files/Support Code (Direct Cucumber Usage)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_feature_filessupport_code__direct_cucumber_usage_.md)

*   **Description:** Although seemingly a general issue, the *way* Cucumber is used directly contributes to this threat.  Developers, misunderstanding Cucumber's purpose or due to convenience, hardcode sensitive information (passwords, API keys) directly within feature files (`.feature` files, parsed by the `gherkin` gem) or within the Ruby code loaded by Cucumber to support test execution (environment files, helper modules, step definitions). This data is then exposed if the repository is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to systems and services, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Feature files (`.feature` files, parsed by the `gherkin` gem).
        *   Environment files (`features/support/env.rb`, loaded by `Cucumber::Runtime`).
        *   Custom helper modules loaded by Cucumber.
        *   Step definition files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables, *never* in files processed by Cucumber.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution.
        *   **`.gitignore`:** Ensure sensitive files are excluded from version control.
        *   **Secure Repository Access:** Implement strong access controls.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Audit feature files and support code specifically for sensitive data.  This is a *Cucumber-specific* audit, not a general code audit.

## Threat: [Malicious Cucumber Plugin](./threats/malicious_cucumber_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Cucumber plugin (or compromises a legitimate one) as a Ruby gem. This plugin contains harmful code that is executed when Cucumber loads and initializes the plugin via `Cucumber::Runtime#load_programming_language`. The attacker's code can then perform actions with the privileges of the user running Cucumber.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, compromise of the testing environment.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Third-party Cucumber plugins (gems extending Cucumber).
        *   `Cucumber::Runtime#load_programming_language` (plugin loading mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Trusted Sources:** Only install plugins from reputable sources (e.g., RubyGems.org, with careful vetting).
        *   **Verify Plugin Integrity:** Check for digital signatures or checksums.
        *   **Code Audits:** Audit the source code of less-known plugins before use.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Cucumber with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Direct Dependencies)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__direct_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in `cucumber-ruby` itself, or in one of its *direct* and *essential* dependencies like the `gherkin` gem (used for parsing feature files) or `cucumber-core` (containing core execution logic).  This is distinct from vulnerabilities in *indirect* dependencies or gems used only within step definitions. The vulnerability allows for RCE, information disclosure, or DoS, directly impacting Cucumber's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Varies (RCE, information disclosure, DoS), but directly affects Cucumber's core functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `cucumber-ruby` gem.
        *   `gherkin` gem (feature file parsing).
        *   `cucumber-core` gem (core execution logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use `bundler` to manage dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use `bundler-audit` or Snyk, focusing on `cucumber-ruby` and its *direct* dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `cucumber-ruby`, `gherkin`, and `cucumber-core` updated.
        *   **Prompt Patching:** Apply security patches immediately.
