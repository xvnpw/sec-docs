# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Step Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_step_definitions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) for all Cucumber step definitions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Actions:** For each `cucumber-ruby` step definition, list all the actions it performs.
    2.  **Determine Minimum Permissions:** For each action, determine the *absolute minimum* permissions required. Favor interacting with the application through its API or UI *within the step definition*, rather than direct system access.
    3.  **Refactor Step Definitions:** Rewrite `cucumber-ruby` step definitions to use only these minimum permissions.
    4.  **Code Review:** During code reviews, specifically check that `cucumber-ruby` step definitions adhere to POLP.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review all `cucumber-ruby` step definitions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** A compromised `cucumber-ruby` step definition could be used for unauthorized access.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential for a `cucumber-ruby` step definition to cause unintended changes.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces the impact if a `cucumber-ruby` step definition is exploited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Unintended Side Effects:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Reduces the *impact* (Medium impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the `user_management` steps (Ruby code within these steps interacts via the API).
    *   Fully implemented in the `reporting` steps (Ruby code only has read-only access).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `email_sending` steps (Ruby code uses a generic account). Needs refactoring.
    *   `file_upload` steps (Ruby code interacts directly with the filesystem). Needs refactoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Input Handling in Feature Files (and Step Definitions)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_input_handling_in_feature_files__and_step_definitions_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Treat all data from `cucumber-ruby` feature files as untrusted; validate and escape within step definitions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Sources:** Identify all places where data from `cucumber-ruby` feature files is used within step definitions.
    2.  **Parameterization:** Use `cucumber-ruby`'s parameterization features (`<parameter>`, data tables).
    3.  **Type Validation:** Within `cucumber-ruby` step definitions, validate the *type* of each parameter.
    4.  **Content Validation:** Within `cucumber-ruby` step definitions, validate the *content* of each parameter.
    5.  **Escaping/Sanitization:** Before using parameters in any potentially dangerous operation *within the Ruby code of the step definition*, escape or sanitize them.
    6.  **Avoid Dynamic Code:** *Never* directly execute code from `cucumber-ruby` feature files within the step definition.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injecting malicious code through `cucumber-ruby` feature files.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Protects against SQL injection if feature file data is used in database queries *within the step definition's Ruby code*.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** If feature file data is used in web UI output *via the step definition*, escaping prevents XSS.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injecting shell commands *via the step definition*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Command Injection:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `user_management` steps (Ruby code does basic type validation).
    *   Implemented for parameters used in database queries (parameterized queries within the Ruby code).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `reporting` steps: Parameters used to construct report filters (within the Ruby code) are not fully validated.
    *   `file_upload` steps: File names and paths from feature files are not sanitized (within the Ruby code).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Hook Management (Cucumber-Ruby Hooks)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_hook_management__cucumber-ruby_hooks_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Design and audit `cucumber-ruby` hooks (`Background`, `Before`, `After`) securely.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Hook Usage:** Use `cucumber-ruby` hooks only for essential setup/teardown.
    2.  **Secure Setup:** If `cucumber-ruby` hooks perform setup, ensure they use secure methods and POLP (within the Ruby code of the hook).
    3.  **Reliable Cleanup:** `cucumber-ruby` `After` hooks *must* reliably clean up. Handle errors during cleanup *within the Ruby code*.
    4.  **No Security Disabling:** Never use `cucumber-ruby` hooks to disable security features.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly review `cucumber-ruby` hook code.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Ensures cleanup to prevent sensitive information from being left behind.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents `cucumber-ruby` hooks from bypassing security.
    *   **Test Interference (Low Severity):** Ensures tests don't leave the system inconsistent.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces risk (High impact).
    *   **Test Interference:** Reduces risk (Low impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `cucumber-ruby` `After` hooks delete test users and clean up records.
    *   `cucumber-ruby` `Before` hooks set up the environment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More robust error handling in `cucumber-ruby` `After` hooks.
    *   Review of `cucumber-ruby` `Before` hooks for unnecessary operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing Test-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) (via Cucumber-Ruby)](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_test-induced_denial_of_service__dos___via_cucumber-ruby_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Design `cucumber-ruby` tests to avoid causing DoS.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *within the Ruby code of step definitions* that interact with external services.
    2.  **Realistic Data:** Use realistic data in `cucumber-ruby` feature files.
    3.  **Avoid loops:** Avoid using loops in the `cucumber-ruby` feature files.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents `cucumber-ruby` tests from overwhelming the system.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Severity):** Ensures tests don't impact performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately reduces risk (Medium impact).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Reduces risk (Low impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
     * None

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is not implemented in `cucumber-ruby` step definitions interacting with external APIs.
    *   Some `cucumber-ruby` scenarios use large datasets. Review and potentially scale down.
    *   Avoid loops in the `cucumber-ruby` feature files.
