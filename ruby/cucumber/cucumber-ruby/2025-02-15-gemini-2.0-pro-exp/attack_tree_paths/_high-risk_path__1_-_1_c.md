# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Malicious Step Definitions -> Read Files (1 -> 1.c)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vector represented by node 1.c ("Read Files") within the broader context of malicious step definitions in a Cucumber-Ruby application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
*   Identify the potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations and suggest additional security measures.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team to reduce the risk.
*   Determine the likelihood of the attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  The ability of an attacker to inject or modify Cucumber step definitions to read arbitrary files from the system.
*   **Target System:**  Applications utilizing the `cucumber-ruby` gem for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data through unauthorized file access.  We will *not* delve into other sub-vectors of malicious step definitions (e.g., RCE beyond file reading) in this specific analysis, although we acknowledge their existence and potential connection.
* **Exclusions:** We are not analyzing the security of Cucumber itself, but rather how it can be *misused* due to insecurely written step definitions.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it by considering various attack scenarios.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze the provided example code snippet and identify potential weaknesses.  We will also consider hypothetical variations of this code.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will assess the likelihood and impact of the vulnerability based on common attack patterns and the specific context of Cucumber-Ruby applications.
4.  **Mitigation Review:**  We will evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested mitigations and propose additional or alternative solutions.
5.  **Risk Assessment:** We will provide a qualitative risk assessment based on the likelihood and impact of the attack.
6. **Documentation Review:** We will review the official Cucumber-Ruby documentation for any relevant security guidance.

### 4.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown

The core attack scenario involves the following steps:

1.  **Compromise Entry Point:**  The attacker gains the ability to modify step definition files.  This could occur through:
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to inject malicious code into the repository.  This could involve weak access controls, unpatched vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software, or compromised credentials for the CI/CD system.
    *   **Developer Account Compromise:**  Gaining access to a developer's account (e.g., through phishing, password reuse, or malware) and directly modifying the step definition files in the source code repository.
    *   **Vulnerable Web Interface:**  If a web interface is used to manage or edit Cucumber tests (less common, but possible), exploiting vulnerabilities in that interface (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection flaws) to inject malicious step definitions.
    *   **Dependency Poisoning:** If step definitions are loaded from an external, untrusted source (e.g., a third-party gem), an attacker could compromise that source and inject malicious code. This is less likely for core Cucumber functionality but could be relevant for custom extensions.
    * **Social Engineering:** The attacker could trick a developer into adding a malicious step definition.

2.  **Injection of Malicious Step Definition:** The attacker introduces a step definition similar to the provided example:

    ```ruby
    Given('I read the contents of {string}') do |file_path|
      puts File.read(file_path)
    end
    ```

    This step definition takes a file path as input and uses `File.read` to read its contents.  The attacker can control the `file_path` parameter.

3.  **Triggering the Step Definition:** The attacker triggers the execution of the malicious step definition.  This typically happens when Cucumber tests are run, either manually by a developer or automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

4.  **Data Exfiltration:**  The contents of the specified file are read and printed to the output (likely the console or a log file).  The attacker can then access this output to obtain the sensitive data.

### 4.2. Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful attack is **HIGH**.  An attacker could potentially read:

*   **Configuration Files:**  `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, application configuration files containing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
*   **Source Code:**  Accessing the application's source code could reveal vulnerabilities, proprietary algorithms, and other sensitive information.
*   **Database Credentials:**  Directly accessing database configuration files or environment variables could allow the attacker to connect to the database and steal or modify data.
*   **SSH Keys:**  Reading private SSH keys could allow the attacker to gain access to other servers.
*   **Logs:** Application or system logs might contain sensitive information like user data, session tokens, or error messages that reveal vulnerabilities.
* **Any file accessible by the user running the Cucumber tests.**

The impact is exacerbated by the fact that Cucumber tests are often run with elevated privileges or within environments that have access to sensitive resources.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Analysis

*   **Vulnerability:**  Unsanitized user input in step definitions leading to arbitrary file read.
*   **Likelihood:**  **HIGH**.  The attack is relatively straightforward to execute if the attacker can modify step definitions.  The prevalence of CI/CD pipelines and the potential for developer account compromise make this a realistic attack vector.
*   **Impact:**  **HIGH** (as detailed above).
*   **Overall Risk:**  **HIGH**.

### 4.4. Mitigation Review and Recommendations

The provided mitigation suggestions are a good starting point, but need to be expanded upon:

*   **Sanitize User Input:**  This is crucial.  *Never* directly use user-provided input as a file path without thorough sanitization.  This includes:
    *   **Path Traversal Prevention:**  Ensure the input does not contain sequences like `../` or `..\` that could allow the attacker to escape the intended directory.  Use functions like `File.absolute_path` to resolve paths and check if they fall within the allowed directory.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Check that the input conforms to expected patterns (e.g., only alphanumeric characters and specific allowed separators).
    *   **Rejecting Absolute Paths:**  Consider disallowing absolute paths entirely and only allowing relative paths within a strictly defined "safe" directory.

*   **Whitelisting:**  This is the **most effective** mitigation.  Instead of trying to sanitize potentially malicious input, define a whitelist of *allowed* files or file patterns.  Only permit access to files that explicitly match the whitelist.  For example:

    ```ruby
    ALLOWED_FILES = [
      "config/allowed_file1.txt",
      "config/allowed_file2.yml",
      %r{^data/reports/\w+\.csv$} # Example using a regular expression
    ].freeze

    Given('I read the contents of {string}') do |file_path|
      # Construct the absolute path relative to a safe base directory
      safe_base_dir = File.expand_path("../safe_data", __FILE__)
      absolute_path = File.join(safe_base_dir, file_path)

      # Check against the whitelist
      unless ALLOWED_FILES.any? { |allowed|
        case allowed
        when String
          absolute_path == File.join(safe_base_dir, allowed)
        when Regexp
          allowed.match?(file_path)
        end
      }
        raise "Access to file '#{file_path}' is not permitted."
      end

      puts File.read(absolute_path)
    end
    ```

*   **Least Privilege:**  Run Cucumber tests with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Create a dedicated user account with restricted file system access.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they manage to exploit a vulnerability.  Avoid running tests as `root` or with administrative privileges.

*   **Principle of Least Astonishment:** Avoid creating step definitions that perform potentially dangerous actions like reading arbitrary files. If such functionality is absolutely necessary, make it very clear in the step definition name and documentation that it has security implications.

*   **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for *all* changes to step definition files.  Reviewers should specifically look for potential security vulnerabilities, including unsanitized input and dangerous file operations.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**
    *   **Secure Configuration:**  Ensure the CI/CD pipeline is configured securely, with strong access controls and authentication.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the CI/CD system and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secrets Management:**  Use a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store sensitive credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline.  Do *not* hardcode credentials in the pipeline configuration.
    *   **Least Privilege (again):** The CI/CD pipeline should have only the necessary permissions to build and test the application.

*   **Developer Security Training:**  Educate developers about secure coding practices, including the risks of unsanitized input and the importance of following the principle of least privilege.

* **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, including insecure file operations.

* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies, including `cucumber-ruby` and any related gems, to patch known vulnerabilities. Use a dependency vulnerability scanner.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as attempts to access unauthorized files.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack vector represented by node 1.c ("Read Files") in the provided attack tree is a **HIGH-RISK** vulnerability.  The ability to read arbitrary files can lead to significant data breaches and compromise the entire system.  While sanitizing user input is a necessary step, **whitelisting** allowed file paths and running Cucumber tests with the **least necessary privileges** are the most effective mitigations.  A comprehensive security strategy that includes secure CI/CD practices, developer training, and code reviews is essential to minimize the risk of this and other related attacks. The likelihood of this attack is high due to the ease of injecting malicious code if other security controls are weak. The impact is also high, making the overall risk high.
