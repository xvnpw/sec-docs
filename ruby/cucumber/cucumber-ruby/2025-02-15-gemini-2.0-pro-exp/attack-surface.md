# Attack Surface Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Step Definition Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/step_definition_code_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Step Definition Code Injection

    *   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary code within step definitions due to unsanitized input from feature files.
    *   **Cucumber-ruby Contribution:** Step definitions are *Ruby code* that `cucumber-ruby` executes.  The framework provides the mechanism for linking feature file content (which can be attacker-controlled) to this Ruby code. This is the *direct* link.
    *   **Example:** A feature file contains: `Given I execute the command "ls -l"`. The (insecure) step definition uses backticks: `Given(/^I execute the command "(.*)"$/) do |command| ` `#{command}` ``. An attacker changes the feature file to: `Given I execute the command "rm -rf /"`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running the tests, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid System Commands:** Prefer Ruby libraries for system interactions.
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* input from feature files before using it in *any* potentially dangerous operation. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Avoid `eval` and Dynamic Code Loading:** Never use `eval` with data from feature files. Avoid dynamic code loading based on feature file content.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Cucumber tests with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Directly within `cucumber-ruby`)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__directly_within__cucumber-ruby__.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerable Dependencies (Directly within `cucumber-ruby`)

    *   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities *within the `cucumber-ruby` gem itself*.
    *   **Cucumber-ruby Contribution:** This is a direct vulnerability *in* the core `cucumber-ruby` code.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in `cucumber-ruby`'s parsing logic allows for remote code execution when processing a specially crafted feature file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep `cucumber-ruby` itself up to date. Use `bundle update cucumber` regularly.  Monitor security advisories specifically for `cucumber-ruby`.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Hook Code](./attack_surfaces/malicious_hook_code.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Hook Code

    * **Description:** Injection of malicious code into Cucumber hooks (Before, After, Around) to execute unauthorized actions.
    * **Cucumber-ruby Contribution:** `cucumber-ruby` provides and executes these hooks. The framework is directly responsible for running this code.
    * **Example:** An attacker, having gained write access to the codebase, modifies a `Before` hook to include `system("malicious_command")`.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, depending on the injected code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all hook code for security vulnerabilities.
        * **Least Privilege:** Ensure hooks run with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Input sanitization:** Sanitize any input that is used in the hooks.
