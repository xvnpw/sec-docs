## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH]: 1 -> 1.a](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__1_-_1_a.md)

*   **1. Malicious Step Definitions [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is the primary and most direct attack vector. Cucumber-Ruby executes Ruby code defined in step definitions. If an attacker can inject or modify these step definitions, they can achieve a variety of malicious goals, including RCE and data exfiltration. The attacker needs to find a way to introduce their code into the step definitions, which could be through various means like exploiting a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline, compromising a developer's account, or finding a flaw in a web interface used to manage tests.

    *   **Sub-Vectors (Critical Nodes):**

        *   **1.a. Execute System Command (Shell) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The most direct path to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The attacker crafts a step definition that uses Ruby methods like backticks (`` ` ``), `system()`, `exec()`, or `Open3.capture3` to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system.
            *   **Example:**
                ```ruby
                Given('I run a malicious command') do
                  `rm -rf /` # Extremely dangerous! Illustrative only.
                end
                ```
            *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly control and review step definitions.  Never allow user input to directly influence shell commands. Sanitize any user-provided data used within step definitions. Avoid using these dangerous functions with any untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH]: 1 -> 1.b](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__1_-_1_b.md)

*   **1. Malicious Step Definitions [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is the primary and most direct attack vector. Cucumber-Ruby executes Ruby code defined in step definitions. If an attacker can inject or modify these step definitions, they can achieve a variety of malicious goals, including RCE and data exfiltration. The attacker needs to find a way to introduce their code into the step definitions, which could be through various means like exploiting a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline, compromising a developer's account, or finding a flaw in a web interface used to manage tests.

    *   **Sub-Vectors (Critical Nodes):**

        *   **1.b. Execute Ruby Code [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Allows for RCE through the execution of arbitrary Ruby code.  Attackers might use `eval()`, `instance_eval()`, or manipulate metaprogramming features.
            *   **Example:**
                ```ruby
                Given(/^I execute arbitrary Ruby code: (.*)$/) do |code|
                  eval(code) # Extremely dangerous! Illustrative only.
                end
                ```
            *   **Mitigation:** Similar to 1.a, strictly control step definitions and avoid using `eval()` or similar functions with untrusted input.  Thorough code reviews are essential.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH]: 1 -> 1.c](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__1_-_1_c.md)

*   **1. Malicious Step Definitions [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is the primary and most direct attack vector. Cucumber-Ruby executes Ruby code defined in step definitions. If an attacker can inject or modify these step definitions, they can achieve a variety of malicious goals, including RCE and data exfiltration. The attacker needs to find a way to introduce their code into the step definitions, which could be through various means like exploiting a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline, compromising a developer's account, or finding a flaw in a web interface used to manage tests.

    *   **Sub-Vectors (Critical Nodes):**

        *   **1.c. Read Files [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the system, potentially exposing sensitive data like configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
            *   **Example:**
                ```ruby
                Given('I read the contents of {string}') do |file_path|
                  puts File.read(file_path)
                end
                ```
            *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitize any user input used to specify file paths.  Use whitelisting to restrict access to only specific, necessary files.  Run Cucumber tests with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH]: 3 -> 3.b (Although very low likelihood, the impact is critical)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__3_-_3_b__although_very_low_likelihood__the_impact_is_critical_.md)

*   **3. Dependency Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:** Cucumber-Ruby, like any software, relies on external libraries (dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.

    *   **Sub-Vectors (Critical Nodes):**
        *   **3.b. Exploit Unknown (0-day) in Dependency [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  A zero-day vulnerability is a previously unknown flaw in software.  Exploiting a 0-day in a Cucumber-Ruby dependency could lead to RCE or other severe consequences. This is a very low likelihood but very high impact scenario.
            *   **Mitigation:** While you cannot directly prevent 0-days, you can minimize their impact.  Employ defense-in-depth strategies:
                *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run tests with minimal permissions.
                *   **Containerization:** Isolate the test environment (e.g., using Docker).
                *   **Robust Logging and Monitoring:** Detect unusual activity.
                *   **Regular Security Audits:** Help identify potential weaknesses.
                *   **Rapid Response Plan:** Have a plan in place to quickly patch and mitigate vulnerabilities when they are disclosed.
