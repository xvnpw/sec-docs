# Attack Tree Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Cucumber-Ruby testing framework or its integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Step Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_step_definitions.md)

* **Description:** This node represents the risk arising from insecurely implemented step definitions within the Cucumber-Ruby test suite. Step definitions are Ruby code that is executed based on the steps defined in feature files. If these definitions are not carefully written, they can introduce significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_command_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Goal:** Execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application or test environment.
    * **Method:** An attacker crafts a malicious feature file. This file contains steps that, when processed by Cucumber-Ruby, trigger a vulnerable step definition. This vulnerable definition executes an external command using user-controlled input from the feature file without proper sanitization.
    * **Example:** A step definition might use backticks or `system()` to execute a command based on a parameter in the Gherkin step. If this parameter isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands (e.g., `ls -l ; cat /etc/passwd`).
    * **Consequences:** Full compromise of the server, data exfiltration, denial of service, installation of malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_sql_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Goal:** Manipulate or extract data from the application's database.
    * **Method:** An attacker crafts a malicious feature file. This file contains steps that, when processed by Cucumber-Ruby, trigger a vulnerable step definition. This vulnerable definition constructs and executes an SQL query using user-controlled input from the feature file without proper sanitization (e.g., using string interpolation instead of parameterized queries).
    * **Example:** A step definition might build an SQL query based on a parameter in the Gherkin step. If this parameter isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code (e.g., `user' OR '1'='1'; --`).
    * **Consequences:** Data breaches, data modification or deletion, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for escalating privileges within the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Indirect Exploitation via Test Environment Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_indirect_exploitation_via_test_environment_compromise.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Goal:** Gain access to the application or its infrastructure by first compromising the test environment.
    * **Method:** An attacker targets vulnerabilities in the infrastructure where Cucumber tests are executed. This could include:
        * **Compromising CI/CD pipelines:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the continuous integration/continuous delivery system used to run tests.
        * **Compromising testing servers:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the servers where tests are executed. This could be due to outdated software, misconfigurations, or weak credentials.
        * **Social engineering:** Tricking developers or testers into revealing credentials or installing malware on test systems.
    * **Consequences:** Once the test environment is compromised, an attacker could:
        * **Access sensitive data:** Test environments often contain copies of production data or sensitive configuration.
        * **Modify code or tests:** Inject malicious code into the application's codebase or manipulate tests to hide malicious activity.
        * **Pivot to production:** Use the compromised test environment as a stepping stone to attack the production environment.
