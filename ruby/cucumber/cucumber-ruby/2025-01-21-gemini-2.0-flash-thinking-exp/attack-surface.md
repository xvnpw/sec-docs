# Attack Surface Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Feature File Injection / Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/feature_file_injection__manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could potentially modify or inject malicious content into feature files, which are then parsed and executed by Cucumber-Ruby.
    * **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cucumber-Ruby's core functionality involves reading and executing instructions defined in feature files. If these files are compromised, Cucumber-Ruby will faithfully execute the malicious steps.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the repository and modifies a feature file to include a step that executes a system command to delete critical data during a test run.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the testing environment, potential data breaches, denial of service during testing, and the introduction of backdoors or malicious code into the application through compromised tests.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls on feature files and the directories where they are stored.
        * Utilize version control systems with integrity checks to track and prevent unauthorized modifications.
        * Implement code review processes for any changes to feature files.
        * Consider signing or verifying the integrity of feature files.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Step Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_step_definitions.md)

* **Description:** Developers might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities within step definitions, or attackers could inject malicious code into existing step definitions.
    * **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Step definitions are Ruby code that Cucumber-Ruby executes. If this code is malicious, Cucumber-Ruby will execute it, granting it access to the application's environment and potentially external resources.
    * **Example:** A developer writes a step definition that directly executes SQL queries without proper sanitization, making the test environment vulnerable to SQL injection if the test data is crafted maliciously. An attacker could inject code into a step definition to exfiltrate environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the testing process, access to sensitive data, modification of application state, and potential compromise of external systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce secure coding practices for step definitions, including input validation and sanitization.
        * Implement thorough code reviews and static analysis on step definition code.
        * Isolate test environments from production environments to limit the impact of potential compromises.
        * Regularly audit step definitions for potential vulnerabilities.
