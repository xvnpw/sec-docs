# Threat Model Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Threat: [Malicious Feature File Injection](./threats/malicious_feature_file_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Gherkin syntax or code snippets into feature files that the `cucumber-ruby` library's parser will process and its execution engine will attempt to run. This could occur if feature files are sourced from untrusted locations or are dynamically generated without proper sanitization. The attacker might modify existing files or introduce new ones.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the testing environment. The injected code, when parsed and executed by `cucumber-ruby`, could perform arbitrary actions, leading to data exfiltration, modification of test results, or denial of service on the testing infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Feature file parser (specifically the Gherkin parser within `cucumber-ruby`), Scenario execution engine within `cucumber-ruby`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Source feature files exclusively from trusted and controlled repositories.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization if feature files are generated dynamically before being processed by `cucumber-ruby`.
    *   Utilize code review processes for any modifications or additions to feature files.
    *   Employ file integrity monitoring systems to detect unauthorized changes to feature files before they are used by `cucumber-ruby`.

## Threat: [Feature File Path Traversal](./threats/feature_file_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** If `cucumber-ruby` is configured to load feature files based on user-provided input (e.g., through command-line arguments or environment variables), an attacker could exploit path traversal vulnerabilities. By manipulating the input (e.g., using sequences like `../`), they could potentially force `cucumber-ruby` to load and execute feature files from outside the intended directories.
*   **Impact:** Execution of unintended test scenarios, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or the execution of malicious code if attacker-controlled feature files are present in accessible locations. This could bypass intended test suites or execute tests designed to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Feature file loading mechanism within `cucumber-ruby`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly determine the paths of feature files loaded by `cucumber-ruby`.
    *   If user input for file paths is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attempts.
    *   Configure `cucumber-ruby` to only load feature files from a predefined set of trusted directories.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Reports](./threats/information_leakage_through_reports.md)

*   **Description:** `cucumber-ruby` generates reports detailing the test execution. If these reporting mechanisms are not carefully configured, they might inadvertently include sensitive information from the application under test or the testing environment within the report content. If these reports are not secured, attackers could gain access to this sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. Sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal system details, could be exposed through the generated reports, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Reporting modules within `cucumber-ruby` (e.g., formatters like HTML, JSON).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review the configuration of `cucumber-ruby`'s reporting formatters to minimize the inclusion of sensitive information.
    *   Implement strict access controls for the generated report files, ensuring only authorized personnel can access them.
    *   Avoid logging or displaying sensitive data within scenarios or step definitions that would be included in the reports.
    *   Consider using report formats that offer more granular control over the data included.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Test Execution Flow](./threats/manipulation_of_test_execution_flow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with control over feature files could manipulate the structure or content of these files to alter the intended flow of test execution within `cucumber-ruby`. This could involve reordering scenarios, adding or removing tags, or modifying scenario outlines to bypass critical tests or target specific parts of the application.
*   **Impact:** Reduced test coverage, leading to potential undetected vulnerabilities. Attackers could strategically modify feature files to avoid running tests that would expose flaws or to execute specific scenarios designed to probe for weaknesses.
*   **Affected Component:** Scenario execution engine within `cucumber-ruby`, Feature file parsing within `cucumber-ruby`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the feature files and strictly control who can modify them.
    *   Implement mechanisms to ensure that all critical tests are executed as part of the standard test suite and cannot be easily skipped through feature file manipulation.
    *   Utilize version control for feature files to track changes and revert unauthorized modifications.
    *   Employ code review processes for changes to feature files to identify potentially malicious alterations.
