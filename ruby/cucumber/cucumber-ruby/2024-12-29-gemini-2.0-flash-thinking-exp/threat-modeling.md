*   **Threat:** Step Definition Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker who can modify step definition files could inject arbitrary code into these Ruby files. When Cucumber-Ruby loads and executes these step definitions, the injected code will be executed with the privileges of the testing process.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the testing environment, potential access to sensitive data, ability to manipulate test results, potential to compromise the application under test if the testing environment is not isolated.
    *   **Affected Component:** Step Definition Loader, Step Definition Execution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on step definition files and the repository where they are stored.
        *   Enforce rigorous code review processes for all changes to step definition files.
        *   Isolate the testing environment from production and other sensitive environments.
        *   Regularly audit step definition code for suspicious or unexpected logic.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Step Definition Logging
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently log sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, database credentials) within step definitions during debugging or normal operation. If an attacker gains access to these logs, they can retrieve this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for unauthorized access to systems or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Step Definition Execution, Logging Mechanisms
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure logging practices, avoiding logging sensitive information.
        *   Use parameterized logging or masking techniques to prevent sensitive data from appearing in logs.
        *   Restrict access to test logs and ensure they are stored securely.
        *   Regularly review logging configurations and step definitions for potential information leaks.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Scenario Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to feature files could inject malicious Gherkin steps or data within scenarios. When Cucumber-Ruby parses and executes these scenarios, the malicious code or data could be interpreted and acted upon by the step definitions, potentially leading to unintended actions within the application under test or the testing environment.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the testing environment or application under test, data manipulation, denial of service during testing.
    *   **Affected Component:** Feature File Parser, Scenario Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on feature files and the repository where they are stored.
        *   Enforce code review processes for all changes to feature files.
        *   Consider using a version control system with robust access management.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within step definitions to handle data from scenarios defensively.
