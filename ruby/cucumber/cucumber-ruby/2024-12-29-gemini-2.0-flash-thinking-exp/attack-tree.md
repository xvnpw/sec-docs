## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server Hosting the Application.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

Compromise Application via Cucumber-Ruby **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Exploit Gherkin Parsing Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Inject Malicious Code via Gherkin Syntax **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Exploit Step Definition Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Inject Malicious Code via Step Definitions ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies Used by Step Definitions ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]***
        * Exploit Insecure Parameter Handling in Step Definitions ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Compromise Application via Cucumber-Ruby**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point of all potential attack paths. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code on the server.

**Critical Node: Exploit Gherkin Parsing Vulnerabilities**

* This node represents a category of attacks that target the way Cucumber-Ruby interprets Gherkin feature files.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting flaws in the Gherkin parser itself to inject and execute malicious code during the parsing process. This could involve crafting specific Gherkin syntax that triggers vulnerabilities in the parser's logic.

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Gherkin Syntax**

* This specific attack step within the "Exploit Gherkin Parsing Vulnerabilities" category represents a direct attempt to embed and execute malicious code within the Gherkin feature files.
    * **Attack Vector:** Crafting Gherkin feature files with embedded code that leverages insecure parsing logic within Cucumber-Ruby to execute arbitrary commands or scripts during the test suite loading phase.

**Critical Node: Exploit Step Definition Vulnerabilities**

* This node represents a category of attacks that target the Ruby code defined in step definitions, which interact with the application under test.

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Step Definitions**

* This path represents a direct and common way to compromise the application by injecting malicious code into the step definitions.
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * Crafting step definitions that use functions like `system()`, backticks, `exec()`, or `eval()` with untrusted input derived from Gherkin scenarios or external sources.
        * This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the Cucumber tests.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies Used by Step Definitions**

* This path highlights the risk of relying on external Ruby gems (dependencies) within step definitions.
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * Leveraging known security vulnerabilities in the gems required by the step definitions.
        * If a dependency has a known exploit (e.g., for remote code execution), an attacker can craft step definitions that trigger this vulnerability through the use of the vulnerable dependency.

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Parameter Handling in Step Definitions**

* This path focuses on the vulnerabilities arising from how step definitions handle parameters passed from Gherkin scenarios.
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * Providing malicious input to step definition parameters without proper validation or sanitization.
        * This can lead to various injection attacks, such as:
            * **SQL Injection:** If the parameter is used in a database query.
            * **Command Injection:** If the parameter is used in a system command.
            * **OS Command Injection:** Similar to command injection, but specifically targeting operating system commands.
            * **Other injection vulnerabilities:** Depending on how the parameter is used within the step definition's code.
