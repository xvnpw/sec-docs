# Attack Surface Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Step Definitions](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_step_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in step definitions that process data from feature files without proper sanitization. This allows execution of arbitrary commands or code within the application's context.
*   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby's core function is to execute step definitions based on instructions in feature files. If step definitions are written to dynamically execute system commands, database queries, or code based on input from feature files (like scenario outlines or example tables) without proper input validation, Cucumber-Ruby becomes the execution engine for these potentially malicious instructions.
*   **Example:** A step definition designed to create files based on feature file input might use `system("touch #{filename}")`. If a feature file provides a malicious filename like `"; rm -rf / #"` , Cucumber-Ruby will execute `system("touch ; rm -rf / #")`, leading to unintended system-level command execution.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access, depending on the privileges of the process running Cucumber-Ruby and the nature of the injected code.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization within step definitions for all data originating from feature files before using it in any dynamic operations (system calls, database queries, code execution).
    *   **Parameterization and Prepared Statements:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within step definitions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:** Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic command execution functions (like `system`, `exec`, `eval`) in step definitions, especially when dealing with external input from feature files. If absolutely necessary, use secure alternatives and extremely strict input validation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Cucumber-Ruby tests and the application under test with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful code injection.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Code Execution in Step Definitions](./attack_surfaces/unintended_code_execution_in_step_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Logic flaws or vulnerabilities within the step definitions themselves, due to coding errors or overly complex logic, can be triggered by specific feature file inputs, leading to unexpected and potentially harmful code execution paths during testing.
*   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby directly executes the code within step definitions. If these definitions contain vulnerabilities due to programming mistakes (e.g., buffer overflows, race conditions, logic errors), Cucumber-Ruby becomes the trigger for these vulnerabilities when it executes the flawed step definitions based on feature file scenarios.
*   **Example:** A step definition might have a complex conditional statement with a logic error that is only triggered by a specific combination of inputs defined in a feature file's scenario outline. This error could lead to an infinite loop, resource exhaustion, or unintended modification of application state during testing, potentially masking real application vulnerabilities or causing instability.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (resource exhaustion), application malfunction, data corruption within the testing environment, potential for masking or misinterpreting actual application vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Step Definitions Simple and Focused:** Design step definitions to be as simple and focused as possible, minimizing complex logic and reducing the chance of introducing programming errors.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices in Step Definitions:** Apply secure coding practices when writing step definitions, including proper error handling, boundary checks, and avoiding common coding vulnerabilities.
    *   **Thorough Unit Testing of Step Definitions:** Unit test step definitions independently of feature files to validate their logic and identify potential vulnerabilities before they are used in Cucumber scenarios.
    *   **Code Reviews for Step Definitions:** Conduct code reviews of step definitions to identify potential logic flaws, vulnerabilities, and areas for simplification.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Feature Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_feature_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or internal system details, might be inadvertently included in feature files, making them a potential source of information leakage if these files are not properly secured.
*   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby relies on feature files as the source of test specifications. If developers mistakenly store sensitive information directly within these files (even for testing purposes), Cucumber-Ruby, by processing these files, effectively incorporates this sensitive data into the test codebase, increasing the risk of exposure.
*   **Example:** Developers might temporarily hardcode API keys or database credentials within feature files for local testing convenience and forget to remove them before committing the code to version control. If the version control system or the deployed test environment is compromised, these sensitive credentials become exposed.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to systems and data, potential for wider system compromise if exposed credentials are valid for production systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information in Feature Files:**  Strictly avoid hardcoding any sensitive information directly into feature files or any part of the codebase.
    *   **Utilize Environment Variables and Secure Configuration Management:** Use environment variables, dedicated configuration files, or secure vault solutions to manage sensitive data required for testing and application runtime.
    *   **Secure Version Control and Access Control:** Implement robust access control and secure practices for version control systems to protect feature files and the entire codebase from unauthorized access.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Feature Files:** Conduct periodic security audits of feature files and the codebase to identify and remove any inadvertently stored sensitive information.
