## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Cucumber-Ruby [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cucumber-ruby__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and is inherently critical. Success means the attacker has breached the application's security using vulnerabilities related to Cucumber-Ruby.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Step Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_step_definitions__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Step definitions are Ruby code and execute within the application's context. If vulnerabilities exist in how step definitions are written, especially when handling external input or interacting with system resources, they can be exploited to compromise the application.
    **Why High-Risk:** Step definitions are often written by developers who may not have deep security expertise, and the focus is often on functionality rather than security. This can lead to overlooking common web application vulnerabilities within the test code itself. The impact of exploiting step definitions can be severe, ranging from data breaches to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Injection in Step Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__code_injection_in_step_definitions__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If step definitions process input from feature files or external sources without proper sanitization or validation, attackers can inject malicious code. This can manifest in various forms:
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Step definitions that directly construct SQL queries using unsanitized input are vulnerable. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
            *   **Why High-Risk:** SQL Injection is a well-known and highly impactful vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially application takeover.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Step definitions that execute system commands using user-controlled input are vulnerable. Attackers can inject malicious commands to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Command Injection allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to full server compromise and control.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] OS Command Injection via Ruby system/exec calls [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Ruby's `system`, `exec`, backticks, and `Kernel.system` functions are particularly susceptible to command injection if used with unsanitized input in step definitions.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Ruby's ease of system calls makes this a tempting but dangerous approach in step definitions. The impact is the same as general Command Injection - full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Step Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_step_definitions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flaws in the logic of step definitions can lead to unintended actions, bypass security checks, or expose vulnerabilities in the application being tested. While not *code injection*, logic errors can still have security implications.
    **Why High-Risk (Medium-High Impact):** Logic errors can be subtle and difficult to detect. They can lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or bypass of intended security controls within the application being tested.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Step Definitions -> Exposing Sensitive Data in Logs/Output](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_step_definitions_-_exposing_sensitive_data_in_logsoutput.md)

**Attack Vector:** Step definitions might inadvertently log or print sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or PII during test execution.
    **Why High-Risk (Medium Impact):** Exposure of sensitive data, even in test logs, can be exploited by attackers who gain access to these logs. This can lead to account compromise, unauthorized access to APIs, or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Dependency Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby or its Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__dependency_vulnerabilities_in_cucumber-ruby_or_its_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Cucumber-Ruby and its dependencies are software components that can contain known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby Gems [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Publicly known vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby gems (dependencies) can be exploited if the application uses vulnerable versions.
            *   **Why High-Risk (High-Critical Impact):** Known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits. Exploiting them can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__sql_injection__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Step definitions that directly construct SQL queries using unsanitized input are vulnerable. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
            **Why High-Risk:** SQL Injection is a well-known and highly impactful vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__command_injection__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Step definitions that execute system commands using user-controlled input are vulnerable. Attackers can inject malicious commands to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            **Why High-Risk:** Command Injection allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to full server compromise and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] OS Command Injection via Ruby system/exec calls [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__os_command_injection_via_ruby_systemexec_calls__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Ruby's `system`, `exec`, backticks, and `Kernel.system` functions are particularly susceptible to command injection if used with unsanitized input in step definitions.
            **Why High-Risk:**  Ruby's ease of system calls makes this a tempting but dangerous approach in step definitions. The impact is the same as general Command Injection - full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby Gems [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_cucumber-ruby_gems__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Publicly known vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby gems (dependencies) can be exploited if the application uses vulnerable versions.
            **Why High-Risk (High-Critical Impact):** Known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits. Exploiting them can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
