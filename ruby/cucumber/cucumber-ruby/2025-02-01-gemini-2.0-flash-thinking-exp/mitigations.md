## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigation Strategy: Regular Audits and Updates of Cucumber-Ruby Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/mitigation_strategy_regular_audits_and_updates_of_cucumber-ruby_dependencies.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regular Audits and Updates of Cucumber-Ruby Dependencies

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Identify Cucumber-Ruby dependencies:** Review your `Gemfile` or `gemspec` to list all gems directly required by `cucumber-ruby` and its plugins. This includes gems like `cucumber-core`, `cucumber-expressions`, `gherkin`, and any formatter or support gems.
    *   Step 2: **Utilize dependency vulnerability scanning for Cucumber-Ruby gems:** Configure `bundle audit` or `bundler-vuln` to specifically monitor vulnerabilities within the identified Cucumber-Ruby dependency gems.
    *   Step 3: **Prioritize updates for Cucumber-Ruby related vulnerabilities:** When vulnerability scans report issues in Cucumber-Ruby dependencies, prioritize updating these gems. Security issues in these gems can directly impact the execution and reliability of your Cucumber tests and potentially the application under test if tests are compromised.
    *   Step 4: **Test Cucumber scenarios after updates:** After updating Cucumber-Ruby dependencies, execute your Cucumber test suite to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced in your test scenarios due to the updates.
    *   Step 5: **Stay informed about Cucumber-Ruby security advisories:** Monitor Cucumber-Ruby project's release notes, security advisories, and community channels for any reported vulnerabilities or security best practices specific to the framework and its dependencies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Cucumber-Ruby framework or its core components - Severity: High
    *   Unreliable or unpredictable test execution due to bugs in outdated Cucumber-Ruby dependencies - Severity: Medium
    *   Potential for malicious scenarios to be injected if Cucumber-Ruby parsing or execution is compromised - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Cucumber-Ruby framework or its core components: High risk reduction
    *   Unreliable or unpredictable test execution due to bugs in outdated Cucumber-Ruby dependencies: Medium risk reduction
    *   Potential for malicious scenarios to be injected if Cucumber-Ruby parsing or execution is compromised: Medium risk reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Currently, vulnerability scanning is not specifically focused on Cucumber-Ruby and its direct dependencies. The CI/CD pipeline needs to be configured to specifically audit these gems and a process for prioritizing and applying updates related to Cucumber-Ruby vulnerabilities needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigation Strategy: Pinning Versions of Cucumber-Ruby and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/mitigation_strategy_pinning_versions_of_cucumber-ruby_and_its_dependencies.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Pinning Versions of Cucumber-Ruby and its Dependencies

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Pin Cucumber-Ruby gem version:** In your `Gemfile`, explicitly specify a fixed version for the `cucumber` gem (e.g., `gem 'cucumber', '5.1.0'`) instead of using loose version constraints.
    *   Step 2: **Pin versions of key Cucumber-Ruby dependencies:** Similarly, pin versions for critical Cucumber-Ruby dependencies like `cucumber-core`, `gherkin`, and any formatters or plugins you rely on.
    *   Step 3: **Update `Gemfile.lock` for Cucumber-Ruby gems:** After pinning versions, run `bundle install` to update `Gemfile.lock`, ensuring the specific versions of Cucumber-Ruby and its dependencies are locked.
    *   Step 4: **Controlled updates of Cucumber-Ruby versions:** When considering updates to Cucumber-Ruby or its dependencies, perform these updates intentionally and in a controlled manner, after thorough testing of your Cucumber scenarios in a non-production environment.
    *   Step 5: **Document pinned Cucumber-Ruby versions:** Document the specific versions of Cucumber-Ruby and its key dependencies being used and the rationale for pinning these versions, especially if related to stability or known issues in other versions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected changes in Cucumber test behavior due to automatic minor or patch updates of Cucumber-Ruby - Severity: Medium
    *   Introduction of bugs or incompatibilities in Cucumber tests due to unintended Cucumber-Ruby updates - Severity: Medium
    *   Inconsistent test execution environments across different development machines or CI/CD pipelines related to Cucumber-Ruby versions - Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected changes in Cucumber test behavior due to automatic minor or patch updates of Cucumber-Ruby: Medium risk reduction
    *   Introduction of bugs or incompatibilities in Cucumber tests due to unintended Cucumber-Ruby updates: Medium risk reduction
    *   Inconsistent test execution environments across different development machines or CI/CD pipelines related to Cucumber-Ruby versions: Low risk reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented

*   **Missing Implementation:** While the `cucumber` gem itself might be pinned, a review is needed to ensure that critical Cucumber-Ruby dependencies are also explicitly pinned in the `Gemfile`. Documentation of the pinned Cucumber-Ruby versions and the controlled update process for Cucumber-Ruby is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigation Strategy: Secure Handling of Test Data within Cucumber Scenarios](./mitigation_strategies/mitigation_strategy_secure_handling_of_test_data_within_cucumber_scenarios.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Handling of Test Data within Cucumber Scenarios

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Avoid embedding sensitive data in Feature Files:** Refrain from directly writing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data within `.feature` files. These files are plain text and often stored in version control.
    *   Step 2: **Parameterize sensitive data in Feature Files:** Use placeholders or variables in your feature files to represent sensitive data. For example, instead of "Given I log in with username 'admin' and password 'password123'", use "Given I log in with username '<username>' and password '<password>'"
