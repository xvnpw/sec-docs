# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `cucumber-ruby`, is a core component in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflows within the Ruby ecosystem. It provides a framework for writing and executing automated tests based on human-readable descriptions of software behavior.

- Business Priorities:
  - Enable clear communication and collaboration between business stakeholders, developers, and testers.
  - Improve software quality through automated testing and behavior specification.
  - Facilitate faster feedback loops in the software development lifecycle.
  - Support agile development methodologies by providing a flexible and adaptable testing framework.

- Business Risks:
  - Defects in the `cucumber-ruby` library could impact the reliability of testing processes for projects that depend on it.
  - Security vulnerabilities in `cucumber-ruby` could be exploited by malicious actors if used in vulnerable applications or environments.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and increased risk over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository management and access control. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Open-source project with community review and contributions, potentially leading to broader security scrutiny. (Implemented: Community Driven Development)
  - security control: Dependency management using RubyGems, relying on RubyGems ecosystem security practices. (Implemented: RubyGems)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the project relies on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching. Response times to security issues may vary.
  - accepted risk: Dependencies on external Ruby gems introduce potential supply chain risks.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential security flaws in the codebase.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage open source components and their licenses.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the `cucumber-ruby` library itself, as it is a testing framework. Authentication is relevant in the context of systems that *use* `cucumber-ruby` for testing, and in the infrastructure where tests are executed (e.g., CI/CD systems).
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is relevant in the context of systems using `cucumber-ruby` and the infrastructure where tests are run. Access control to feature files, test results, and execution environments should be considered in those contexts.
  - Input Validation: `cucumber-ruby` parses feature files written in Gherkin. Robust input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities through maliciously crafted feature files. This should be implemented in the Gherkin parsing logic.
  - Cryptography: `cucumber-ruby` itself is unlikely to directly implement cryptographic functions. However, projects using `cucumber-ruby` for testing might interact with systems that use cryptography. Testing these systems would require handling cryptographic elements securely within the test environment, but this is outside the scope of the `cucumber-ruby` library itself. If `cucumber-ruby` were to introduce features that require cryptography (e.g., secure reporting), then appropriate cryptographic libraries and best practices should be used.

## DEPLOYMENT

`cucumber-ruby` itself is a library and is not "deployed" in the traditional sense of a web application or service. It is included as a dependency within other Ruby projects. Therefore, the "deployment" context here refers to how projects *using* `cucumber-ruby` are deployed and how Cucumber tests are executed within those deployment environments.

We will consider a common deployment scenario: running Cucumber tests in a CI/CD environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the quality and reliability of the `cucumber-ruby` library.
  - Ensuring the security of the `cucumber-ruby` library to prevent vulnerabilities in projects that depend on it.
  - Supporting the Ruby BDD testing community with a stable and well-maintained framework.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of `cucumber-ruby`: Sensitivity - High (Confidentiality and Integrity). Unauthorized access or modification could lead to vulnerabilities and compromise the project.
  - Build artifacts (RubyGems package): Sensitivity - High (Integrity and Availability). Tampering with the gem package could introduce malicious code or break functionality for users.
  - Issue tracker and communication channels: Sensitivity - Medium (Confidentiality and Integrity). Information about vulnerabilities or project roadmap should be managed appropriately.
  - User data (in the context of the library itself, minimal): Sensitivity - Low. `cucumber-ruby` primarily processes feature files and test data provided by users, which are not directly managed by the library itself. However, projects using Cucumber might handle sensitive data in their tests, which is a separate concern for those projects.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target risk appetite for the `cucumber-ruby` project? Is it a high priority to achieve a very high level of security, or is a more pragmatic approach acceptable given its open-source nature?
  - Are there specific compliance requirements or security standards that the `cucumber-ruby` project needs to adhere to?
  - What are the expected deployment environments for projects using `cucumber-ruby`? Are there specific security considerations for those environments that should be addressed in the `cucumber-ruby` design or documentation?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports for `cucumber-ruby`? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?

- Assumptions:
  - The `cucumber-ruby` project aims to follow general secure coding practices for Ruby development.
  - The project relies on the security features provided by GitHub and RubyGems platforms.
  - The community is expected to contribute to identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
  - Security is considered an important aspect of the project, but resources for dedicated security efforts may be limited due to its open-source nature.
