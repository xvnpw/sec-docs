# Attack Surface Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Feature Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_feature_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify feature files with the intention of executing malicious code during test runs.
    *   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby directly parses and executes the steps defined within these feature files. It trusts the content of these files to be safe and follows the instructions within them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a feature file that includes a scenario with a step definition like `Given I execute system command "rm -rf /"`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the test environment, potential data loss, or unauthorized access to connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on feature file repositories and directories.
        *   Use code review processes for changes to feature files.
        *   Consider signing or verifying the integrity of feature files.
        *   Run tests in isolated and sandboxed environments.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Step Definitions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_step_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Developers write step definitions that contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, insecure API calls) or intentionally malicious code.
    *   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby executes the code defined within these step definitions without inherent security checks on the code's actions.
    *   **Example:** A step definition that takes user input from a scenario outline and directly uses it in a system command without sanitization: `When I execute command "<command>"` where `<command>` could be `ls && cat /etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the test environment, potential data breaches if step definitions interact with sensitive data, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices when writing step definitions, including input validation and output encoding.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews of step definitions.
        *   Avoid executing arbitrary system commands within step definitions if possible. If necessary, use secure alternatives or sandboxed environments.
        *   Regularly audit step definitions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Feature Files or Step Definitions](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_feature_files_or_step_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal system details are inadvertently included in feature files or step definitions.
    *   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Cucumber-Ruby processes these files, making the sensitive information accessible during test execution and potentially in reports or version control.
    *   **Example:** A feature file containing a step like `Given the API key is "super_secret_key"`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches if exposed credentials are used to access production systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in feature files and step definitions.
        *   Use environment variables or secure vault solutions to manage sensitive credentials.
        *   Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive information from test reports and logs.
        *   Regularly scan feature files and step definitions for potential secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_cucumber-ruby_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the `cucumber-ruby` gem itself or in its dependencies.
    *   **How Cucumber-Ruby Contributes:** Applications using `cucumber-ruby` inherently rely on these dependencies, and vulnerabilities within them can be exploited during Cucumber's execution.
    *   **Example:** A known security flaw in a parsing library used by Cucumber to process feature files could be exploited if not updated.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the test environment or the application if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution or other severe exploits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `cucumber-ruby` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to `cucumber-ruby` and its dependencies.
