## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Feature Files

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Inject Malicious Feature Files" within an application utilizing Cucumber-Ruby. This path represents a significant security risk due to its potential for achieving arbitrary command execution on the server.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Inject Malicious Feature Files [HIGH RISK PATH]**

*   **Gain Write Access to Feature File Location [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Malicious Feature File Contains Exploitable Content**
        *   **Execute Arbitrary System Commands via Step Definitions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**

**Understanding the Context:**

Cucumber-Ruby relies on plain-text feature files written in Gherkin syntax to define application behavior. These files are typically located within the project directory. Step definitions are Ruby code that maps the Gherkin steps to actual actions.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Node:**

**1. Inject Malicious Feature Files [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker in this scenario. They aim to introduce a feature file into the application's feature file directory that contains malicious content designed to compromise the system.
* **Risk Level:** HIGH. Successful injection of malicious feature files can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
* **Impact:**
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data stored within the application or accessible by the server can be stolen.
    * **System Tampering:** The attacker can modify system configurations, install malware, or disrupt normal operations.
    * **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.

**2. Gain Write Access to Feature File Location [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** This is a crucial prerequisite for injecting malicious feature files. The attacker needs to find a way to write files to the directory where Cucumber expects to find feature files.
* **Risk Level:** CRITICAL. Achieving write access to the application's codebase is a significant security vulnerability.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Vulnerable Web Interface/API:** If the application has a web interface or API that allows file uploads or modifications without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker might exploit this to upload malicious feature files. This could be through a forgotten admin panel, a poorly secured file upload feature, or an API endpoint with insufficient access controls.
    * **Operating System Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system could grant the attacker elevated privileges, allowing them to write to restricted directories.
    * **Compromised Credentials:** If an attacker gains access to developer credentials (e.g., SSH keys, Git credentials), they can directly modify the codebase, including adding malicious feature files.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** If the application relies on external libraries or dependencies, a compromise in one of these dependencies could allow an attacker to inject malicious files during the build or deployment process.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions:** Incorrect file system permissions on the feature file directory could inadvertently allow unauthorized write access.
    * **Social Engineering:** Tricking a developer or administrator into manually placing the malicious file on the server.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Robust Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all interfaces that interact with the file system.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that could influence file paths or content.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes. The application should not run with elevated privileges unless absolutely required.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Management and Security Scanning:**  Use tools to manage dependencies and scan them for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Code Review:** Implement a rigorous code review process to identify security flaws before deployment.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement tools to detect unauthorized modifications to critical files, including feature files.
    * **Operating System Hardening:** Secure the underlying operating system by applying security patches, disabling unnecessary services, and configuring appropriate firewall rules.

**3. Malicious Feature File Contains Exploitable Content:**

* **Description:** Once write access is gained, the attacker will inject a feature file crafted to exploit the application's step definitions. This file will contain Gherkin steps designed to trigger the execution of malicious code.
* **Risk Level:** HIGH. The content of the malicious file directly determines the severity of the exploit.
* **Exploitable Content Examples:**
    * **Steps calling system commands:**  The feature file might contain steps that directly invoke system commands using Ruby's backticks (`) or `system()` methods within the corresponding step definitions.
    * **Steps manipulating files:** Steps could be designed to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the server.
    * **Steps making external requests:**  Steps could be crafted to make malicious requests to external servers, potentially for data exfiltration or to launch attacks on other systems.
    * **Steps interacting with databases:** Steps could be used to manipulate database records, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access.

**4. Execute Arbitrary System Commands via Step Definitions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** This is the culmination of the attack path. The malicious feature file, when executed by Cucumber, triggers the corresponding step definitions, which contain code that executes arbitrary system commands.
* **Risk Level:** CRITICAL and HIGH RISK PATH. This node represents the direct execution of attacker-controlled commands on the server.
* **Mechanism:**
    * **Vulnerable Step Definitions:** The core vulnerability lies in step definitions that directly execute shell commands based on user-provided input or data from the feature file without proper sanitization or validation.
    * **Example (Vulnerable Step Definition):**
        ```ruby
        Given('I execute the command "{string}"') do |command|
          `#{command}` # Vulnerable: Directly executes the command
        end
        ```
    * **Malicious Feature File Example:**
        ```gherkin
        Feature: Exploit

          Scenario: Execute malicious command
            Given I execute the command "rm -rf /"
        ```
* **Impact:**
    * **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the server.
    * **Data Breach:** Sensitive data can be accessed and exfiltrated.
    * **Denial of Service:** The attacker can shut down the application or the entire server.
    * **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install persistent malware on the system.
    * **Lateral Movement:** The compromised server can be used as a launching point to attack other systems within the network.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Direct System Command Execution in Step Definitions:**  Minimize or completely avoid the need to execute arbitrary system commands within step definitions.
    * **Input Sanitization and Validation:** If system commands are absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate any input used to construct those commands. Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting.
    * **Use Secure Alternatives:**  Explore safer alternatives to executing shell commands, such as using Ruby libraries or APIs that provide the desired functionality.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (for Application User):** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve command execution.
    * **Sandboxing and Containerization:**  Isolate the application within a sandbox or container to limit the impact of a successful attack.
    * **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Thoroughly review step definitions for potential command injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to identify risky code patterns.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

This attack path represents a **critical security risk** due to the potential for achieving arbitrary command execution. The combination of gaining write access to the codebase and the presence of vulnerable step definitions creates a significant threat. The impact of a successful attack could be catastrophic, leading to data breaches, system outages, and severe reputational damage.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Mitigation of Write Access Vulnerabilities:**  Focus on securing the feature file location and preventing unauthorized write access. This is the first and most critical step in breaking this attack path.
* **Thoroughly Review Step Definitions:**  Audit all step definitions for potential command injection vulnerabilities. Replace direct system command execution with safer alternatives or implement robust sanitization.
* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Ensure proper access controls are in place for all interfaces that interact with the file system and code repository.
* **Adopt Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on secure coding principles and best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses.
* **Dependency Management:**  Keep dependencies up-to-date and scan them for known vulnerabilities.
* **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement tools to detect unauthorized changes to feature files.
* **Consider Code Signing:**  If feasible, implement code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of feature files.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Feature Files" attack path highlights the importance of secure coding practices and robust access controls in applications utilizing Cucumber-Ruby. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability and protect the application and its users from potential harm.
