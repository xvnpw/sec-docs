# Threat Model Analysis for cucumber/cucumber-ruby

## Threat: [Step Definition Code Injection](./threats/step_definition_code_injection.md)

### Threat: Step Definition Code Injection
- **Description:** An attacker with write access to step definition files could inject malicious Ruby code into a step definition. This code would be executed by the Cucumber-Ruby interpreter when the corresponding step is encountered during test execution. The attacker could leverage Cucumber-Ruby's execution context to interact with the underlying system or the application under test in unintended and harmful ways.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the test environment and potentially the application under test, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system manipulation.
- **Affected Component:** Step Definition Loader, Step Execution
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access controls and authentication for step definition files.
    - Enforce mandatory code review processes for all changes to step definitions.
    - Utilize static analysis tools and linters to identify potential code vulnerabilities within step definitions.
    - Employ secure coding practices when writing step definitions, avoiding dynamic code execution based on external input.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Step Definitions](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_step_definitions.md)

### Threat: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Step Definitions
- **Description:** Developers might unintentionally hardcode sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, database credentials) directly within step definitions for convenience during testing. When Cucumber-Ruby loads and executes these step definitions, this sensitive information becomes readily available within the test environment's memory and codebase. An attacker gaining access to the codebase would then easily retrieve this information.
- **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.
- **Affected Component:** Step Definition Files
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in step definitions.
    - Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools to manage sensitive data used in tests.
    - Implement secrets management practices for test environments.
    - Regularly scan the codebase for hardcoded secrets.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_cucumber-ruby_dependencies.md)

### Threat: Vulnerabilities in Cucumber-Ruby Dependencies
- **Description:** Cucumber-Ruby relies on various Ruby gems. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and the project uses a vulnerable version, these vulnerabilities could be exploited during Cucumber-Ruby's execution. This could occur when Cucumber-Ruby loads or utilizes a vulnerable dependency's code.
- **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the test environment or other security compromises depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.
- **Affected Component:** Gem Dependencies, Cucumber-Ruby's dependency loading mechanism
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Cucumber-Ruby and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    - Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Gemnasium) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    - Implement a process for monitoring and responding to security advisories related to Ruby gems.
