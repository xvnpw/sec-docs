# Threat Model Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution during Build](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_during_build.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits critical vulnerabilities within Jekyll itself or its core dependencies (gems). By crafting malicious input files or exploiting existing weaknesses, they can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server during the Jekyll build process. This allows for complete server takeover, installation of backdoors, data exfiltration, and manipulation of the generated website content.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the build server, leading to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Potential for widespread damage including data breaches, supply chain attacks, and website defacement.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Jekyll Core, Gems (Core Dependencies), Build Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately apply security updates for Jekyll and all core gems.
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning for dependencies using `bundle audit` and CI/CD integration.
    *   Enforce strict isolation and sandboxing for the build environment to limit the blast radius of any successful exploit.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to the build process user account.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Build Artifacts (Sensitive Secrets)](./threats/information_disclosure_through_build_artifacts__sensitive_secrets_.md)

*   **Description:** Highly sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or private keys, is mistakenly included in Jekyll source files or configuration. Due to misconfiguration or oversight, these secrets are inadvertently exposed in the generated static website within the `_site` directory. An attacker discovering these secrets gains unauthorized access to critical external services, internal systems, or sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** **High**.  Exposure of highly sensitive secrets leading to unauthorized access to critical systems and data. Potential for significant data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Jekyll Core, Configuration Handling, Output Generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Completely avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in Jekyll source code or configuration files.
    *   Mandatory use of secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and environment variables for handling sensitive data.
    *   Implement automated checks to prevent accidental inclusion of secrets in the `_site` directory before deployment.
    *   Rigorous review process for the generated `_site` directory to identify and remove any unintended sensitive files.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Gems (Critical Vulnerabilities)](./threats/vulnerable_gems__critical_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Jekyll relies on Ruby gems. If a *critically* vulnerable gem is used, and this vulnerability is exploitable within the Jekyll context, an attacker can leverage this weakness. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process or even in the generated website if the vulnerable gem's code is included in the output.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Depending on the gem vulnerability, impact can range from arbitrary code execution on the build server to compromising website visitors if vulnerable code is included in the static site.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Gems (Dependencies), Gem Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if critical vulnerability is present in a gem).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a policy of immediate patching for critical vulnerabilities in gems.
    *   Utilize `bundle audit` in CI/CD pipelines to automatically fail builds if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
    *   Implement automated dependency update processes to ensure timely patching.
    *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for deeper dependency vulnerability analysis.

## Threat: [Malicious Gems (Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks)](./threats/malicious_gems__dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker successfully executes a dependency confusion attack or other supply chain attack by introducing a malicious gem that is mistakenly included in the Jekyll project's dependencies. This malicious gem, when installed, executes code during the `bundle install` process or when Jekyll uses the gem, leading to compromise of developer machines and potentially the build server.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Compromise of developer workstations and build infrastructure. Potential for data theft, code injection into the website, and further propagation of malicious code through the development pipeline.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Gems (Dependencies), Gem Installation Process, Gem Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict verification of gem sources and maintainers before adding new dependencies.
    *   Enforce the use of reputable and trusted gem sources like rubygems.org, and potentially private gem repositories for internal dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency pinning and integrity checks (e.g., using `Gemfile.lock` and verifying checksums) to ensure only trusted gems are used.
    *   Implement monitoring for unexpected dependency changes and new dependency additions in pull requests and code reviews.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins](./threats/malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor creates and distributes a Jekyll plugin containing intentionally malicious code. If a developer unknowingly installs and uses this plugin, the malicious code executes during the Jekyll build process. This grants the attacker arbitrary code execution capabilities on the build server, allowing for complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the build server, leading to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Potential for widespread damage including data breaches and website defacement.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Jekyll Plugin System, Plugin Execution, Build Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a strict policy of only using plugins from highly trusted and well-vetted sources.
    *   Mandatory code review and security audit of plugin code before integration, especially for plugins from external or less reputable sources.
    *   Consider implementing plugin sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit the impact of a compromised plugin (if technically feasible within Jekyll's plugin architecture).
    *   Minimize the number of plugins used to reduce the overall attack surface.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugins (High Severity Vulnerabilities)](./threats/vulnerable_plugins__high_severity_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** A Jekyll plugin, even from a seemingly reputable source, contains a *high severity* security vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service during the build process or within the generated website if the vulnerable plugin's code is included in the output.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Potential for arbitrary code execution on the build server or within the generated website, leading to server compromise, data breaches, or website defacement.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Jekyll Plugin System, Specific Vulnerable Plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if high severity vulnerability is present in a plugin).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Proactively monitor plugin repositories and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement automated plugin vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Establish a process for promptly updating or replacing plugins with known high severity vulnerabilities.
    *   If a plugin is no longer maintained or has persistent vulnerabilities, consider replacing it with a more secure alternative or removing its functionality.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through User-Provided Content (High Impact)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_user-provided_content__high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided content (e.g., data files used for dynamic elements, or in scenarios where Jekyll is used to generate content based on external data) is not rigorously sanitized and is rendered on the website, it can introduce high-impact XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker injects malicious scripts into this user content. When website visitors interact with the affected parts of the generated site, these scripts execute in their browsers, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and website defacement *on the client-side*, potentially affecting a large number of users.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Widespread client-side attacks affecting website visitors. Potential for large-scale session hijacking, credential theft, malware distribution, and reputational damage due to website defacement in user browsers.
*   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Liquid Templating Engine, Content Rendering, Data Processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side input sanitization and validation for *all* user-provided content before it is processed by Jekyll and rendered on the website.
    *   Utilize Liquid's output encoding features correctly and consistently to prevent XSS vulnerabilities during content rendering.
    *   Deploy a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to significantly mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the capabilities of injected scripts in user browsers.
    *   Regularly perform XSS vulnerability testing on the generated website, especially focusing on areas that render user-provided content.
