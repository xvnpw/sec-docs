### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 4.1.1.1. Credentials hardcoded in deployment scripts

#### 4. Exploit Deployment Process [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Description:** This top-level node highlights the inherent risks associated with the deployment process of a Jekyll site.  Deployment is a critical phase where vulnerabilities can be introduced or exploited, potentially compromising the entire web application and its infrastructure.  Jekyll, being a static site generator, still relies on a deployment process to transfer the generated static files to a web server. This process often involves scripts and automation, which can become attack vectors if not secured properly.
*   **Why Critical & High-Risk:**  A compromised deployment process can bypass all security measures implemented within the Jekyll application itself. Attackers gaining control during deployment can:
    *   Replace legitimate website content with malicious content (defacement, phishing).
    *   Inject malware into website files.
    *   Gain access to the underlying server infrastructure.
    *   Steal sensitive data used during deployment (credentials, configuration).
*   **Jekyll Context:** Jekyll deployments often involve:
    *   **Local Generation:** Jekyll sites are typically generated locally on a developer's machine or a CI/CD server.
    *   **Deployment Scripts:** Scripts (Bash, Python, Ruby, etc.) are used to automate the process of transferring the generated `_site` directory to a web server. Common methods include `rsync`, `scp`, `FTP`, Git-based deployments, or cloud platform deployments.
    *   **Server-Side Configuration:**  Deployment might involve server-side configuration changes, such as restarting web servers or updating configurations.

#### 4.1. Insecure Deployment Scripts [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Description:** This node narrows down the focus to the deployment scripts themselves.  If these scripts are insecure, they become a prime target for attackers. Insecure scripts can contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or control over the deployment process and potentially the target server.
*   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** Deployment scripts often operate with elevated privileges to perform tasks like file transfer, server restarts, and configuration changes.  Vulnerabilities in these scripts can be directly exploited to gain privileged access.
*   **Jekyll Context:** Jekyll deployment scripts might:
    *   Build the Jekyll site (`jekyll build`).
    *   Copy files to a web server using `rsync`, `scp`, or `FTP`.
    *   Connect to cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
    *   Interact with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
    *   Restart web servers (Nginx, Apache) via SSH.

#### 4.1.1. Vulnerabilities in scripts used to deploy the Jekyll site [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Description:** This node further emphasizes the presence of vulnerabilities within the deployment scripts.  It's a general category encompassing various types of security flaws that can exist in script code.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Vulnerabilities in scripts, especially those involved in deployment, can have significant consequences due to the sensitive nature of deployment operations.  Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to a wide range of attacks.
*   **Jekyll Context:**  Vulnerabilities in Jekyll deployment scripts could include:
    *   **Command Injection:** If scripts construct commands using user-controlled input without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious commands.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Scripts that handle file paths incorrectly might allow attackers to access or modify files outside the intended deployment directory.
    *   **Insecure Permissions:** Scripts might set overly permissive file or directory permissions on the deployed website.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Scripts might inadvertently leak sensitive information through logging or error messages.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials (Our Focus Node):**  As detailed in the next node.

#### 4.1.1.1. Credentials hardcoded in deployment scripts [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Description:** This is the most specific node in our path and the focus of this deep analysis. It describes the vulnerability of embedding sensitive credentials directly within the deployment scripts.  These credentials could be passwords, API keys, SSH private keys, or any other secret information required for deployment.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  **Developer Mistake:** Developers, for convenience or lack of awareness, might hardcode credentials directly into deployment scripts. This could be in plain text or even "obfuscated" but easily reversible forms.
    2.  **Script Storage:** These scripts are then typically stored in version control systems (like Git repositories), alongside the Jekyll project code.
    3.  **Exposure in Repository:** If the repository is publicly accessible (e.g., public GitHub repository) or if an attacker gains access to the repository (e.g., compromised developer account, insider threat), the hardcoded credentials become exposed.
    4.  **Credential Extraction:** Attackers can easily extract the hardcoded credentials by simply reading the script files.
    5.  **Exploitation of Credentials:**  With the extracted credentials, attackers can:
        *   **Access Deployment Infrastructure:** Gain access to servers, cloud platforms, or services used for deployment.
        *   **Compromise Web Server:**  Access the web server hosting the Jekyll site, potentially gaining full control.
        *   **Data Breach:** Access databases, APIs, or other sensitive resources if the credentials provide access to them.
        *   **Malicious Deployment:**  Modify deployment scripts to inject malware or backdoors into future deployments.
*   **Impact:** **HIGH IMPACT**.  Compromising credentials used in the deployment process can have catastrophic consequences:
    *   **Complete Infrastructure Compromise:** Attackers can gain control over the entire deployment pipeline and potentially the production web server.
    *   **Website Defacement and Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers can replace the legitimate Jekyll site with malicious content, damaging reputation and potentially harming users.
    *   **Data Breach and Sensitive Information Exposure:** If the credentials provide access to databases, APIs, or other sensitive data stores, attackers can steal confidential information.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromised deployment scripts can be modified to inject malware into future deployments, affecting all users of the website.
    *   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** All three pillars of information security are severely impacted.
*   **Jekyll Context:** In Jekyll deployments, hardcoded credentials might be used for:
    *   **SSH/SCP/FTP credentials:** To upload the `_site` directory to a web server.
    *   **Cloud Provider API Keys (AWS, GCP, Azure):** To deploy to cloud storage or serverless functions.
    *   **Database credentials:** If Jekyll is integrated with a database for dynamic features (though less common for core Jekyll).
    *   **Content Management System (CMS) API keys:** If Jekyll is used in conjunction with a headless CMS.
    *   **Version Control System credentials:**  In some automated deployment workflows that push directly from CI/CD to a Git repository on the server.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **NEVER Hardcode Credentials:** This is the fundamental principle.  Avoid embedding any sensitive information directly in scripts, configuration files, or code.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive credentials as environment variables. Access these variables within deployment scripts at runtime. This separates credentials from the codebase and allows for different configurations in different environments (development, staging, production).
    *   **Secrets Management Tools:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. These tools provide secure storage, access control, and auditing of secrets.
    *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Employ configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to manage server configurations and securely deploy secrets to servers.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Secrets Management:** Modern CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) offer built-in mechanisms for securely managing secrets and injecting them into build and deployment pipelines. Use these features.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to limit access to deployment infrastructure and secrets to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of deployment scripts to identify and eliminate any instances of hardcoded credentials or other security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to automatically scan deployment scripts for potential security flaws, including hardcoded secrets.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit deployment processes and scripts to ensure adherence to secure coding practices and secrets management policies.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to deployment scripts and processes. Avoid using overly privileged accounts.
    *   **Ephemeral Credentials:** Where possible, use short-lived or dynamically generated credentials to minimize the window of opportunity for exploitation if credentials are compromised.
