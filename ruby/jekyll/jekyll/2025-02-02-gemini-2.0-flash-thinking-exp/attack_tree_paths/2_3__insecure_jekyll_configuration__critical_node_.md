### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.3.1. Unsafe Mode Enabled

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Unsafe Mode Enabled" attack path.

#### 4.1. 2.3.1. Unsafe Mode Enabled (if applicable/older versions) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Description:** This node represents the vulnerability arising from enabling "unsafe mode" in Jekyll.  "Unsafe mode" was a feature in older versions of Jekyll (specifically Jekyll 3 and earlier, and potentially some configurations in Jekyll 4 depending on plugins and settings) that allowed for the execution of arbitrary Ruby code during the site build process.

*   **Attack Vector:** The primary attack vector is through malicious content injected into Jekyll's source files. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   **Compromised Source Code Repository:** If an attacker gains access to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) where the Jekyll project is hosted, they can directly modify files, including Liquid templates, data files, or plugin code, to inject malicious Ruby code.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies/Plugins:**  While less directly related to "unsafe mode" itself, vulnerabilities in Jekyll plugins, especially if "unsafe mode" is enabled, could be exploited to inject malicious code that is then executed during the build process.
    *   **Social Engineering/Insider Threat:**  An attacker could trick a developer or contributor with access to the Jekyll project into adding malicious content or enabling "unsafe mode" if it's not already active.

*   **Impact:** The impact of successfully exploiting "unsafe mode" is **critical**.  Enabling arbitrary code execution during the build process allows an attacker to:
    *   **Gain Full Server-Side Code Execution:**  The injected Ruby code executes on the server where Jekyll is building the site. This grants the attacker the same privileges as the user running the Jekyll build process.
    *   **System Compromise:**  With server-side code execution, an attacker can perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the server, including databases, configuration files, and other applications running on the same server.
        *   **Malware Installation:** Installing malware, backdoors, or rootkits to maintain persistent access to the compromised system.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting the server's operations or taking it offline.
        *   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
        *   **Website Defacement:**  Modifying the generated website content to display malicious or unwanted information.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Liquid Templating Engine:** Jekyll uses Liquid as its templating engine. In "safe mode" (the default and recommended setting), Liquid templates are sandboxed, restricting access to potentially dangerous Ruby methods and objects.
    *   **"Unsafe Mode" Bypasses Sandboxing:** When "unsafe mode" is enabled (typically by setting `safe: false` in `_config.yml` or using the `--unsafe` command-line flag in older versions), this sandboxing is disabled. This allows Liquid templates and plugins to execute arbitrary Ruby code.
    *   **Exploitation via Liquid Templates:** Attackers can inject malicious Ruby code directly into Liquid templates (e.g., `.html`, `.md` files) using Liquid tags and filters that, in "unsafe mode", can execute arbitrary Ruby. For example, in older versions, constructs like `{{ 'system("malicious_command")' | ruby }}` (hypothetical example, syntax might vary) could be used to execute system commands.
    *   **Exploitation via Plugins:**  Attackers could also create or modify Jekyll plugins (Ruby files in the `_plugins` directory) to include malicious code. If "unsafe mode" is enabled, these plugins will execute with full Ruby capabilities during the build process.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Enable "Unsafe Mode":**  **The most critical mitigation is to absolutely avoid enabling "unsafe mode" in Jekyll.**  This is generally the default and strongly recommended configuration.
    *   **Modern Jekyll Versions (Jekyll 4+):**  "Unsafe mode" is largely deprecated and less relevant in modern Jekyll versions.  Jekyll 4 and later have significantly improved security defaults and plugin sandboxing. However, it's still crucial to ensure that `safe: true` is explicitly set in `_config.yml` (though it's the default).
    *   **Secure Plugin Management:**  If using Jekyll plugins, carefully vet and audit them. Only use plugins from trusted sources and keep them updated. Be aware that even in "safe mode", plugins can potentially introduce vulnerabilities if they are poorly written or contain security flaws.
    *   **Input Sanitization (for dynamic content):** If your Jekyll site incorporates dynamic content (e.g., user-generated content, data from external sources), ensure proper input sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks that could be exploited if "unsafe mode" were ever accidentally enabled.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Jekyll build process with the least privileged user account necessary. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if code execution is achieved.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your Jekyll project, including configuration files, plugins, and dependencies, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:** Implement code review processes for any changes to the Jekyll project, especially for templates, plugins, and configuration files, to catch potential security issues before they are deployed.

*   **Real-World Examples (Illustrative):** While specific public exploits directly targeting "unsafe mode" in Jekyll might be less documented (as it's generally considered a misconfiguration rather than a vulnerability in Jekyll itself), the principle is similar to other code execution vulnerabilities in web applications. Imagine a scenario where a developer accidentally sets `safe: false` in a development environment and then pushes a compromised Liquid template to the repository. If the production build process also uses this configuration, the attacker's code will execute on the production server during the build.

*   **Severity Assessment:** **CRITICAL**.  Exploiting "unsafe mode" leads to arbitrary server-side code execution, which is consistently rated as a critical severity vulnerability due to the potential for complete system compromise.

#### 4.2. 2.3.1.1. Allow execution of arbitrary code during build [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Description:** This node is a direct consequence of enabling "unsafe mode". It explicitly states the core issue: "unsafe mode" allows for the execution of arbitrary code during the Jekyll build process.

*   **Attack Vector:**  As described in 4.1, the attack vector remains the injection of malicious code into Jekyll's source files, leveraging the disabled sandboxing of "unsafe mode".

*   **Impact:** The impact is identical to that described in 4.1: **Critical server-side code execution, full system compromise.**

*   **Technical Details:** This node emphasizes the direct link between "unsafe mode" and the ability to execute arbitrary code. It highlights that the lack of sandboxing is the root cause of this vulnerability.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:** The mitigation strategies are the same as outlined in 4.1, with the **absolute imperative to disable "unsafe mode"** being the primary defense.

*   **Severity Assessment:** **CRITICAL**.  This node reinforces the critical severity of the vulnerability, as it directly describes the capability of arbitrary code execution.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Unsafe Mode Enabled" attack path represents a critical security vulnerability in Jekyll, particularly in older versions or misconfigured deployments. Enabling "unsafe mode" bypasses essential security sandboxing, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server during the site build process.

**Key Takeaways for the Development Team:**

*   **Never enable "unsafe mode" in Jekyll.** Ensure `safe: true` is set in your `_config.yml` (or remove `safe: false` if it's present).
*   **Treat "unsafe mode" as a severe misconfiguration, not a feature.**
*   **Focus on secure plugin management and dependency updates.**
*   **Implement robust access controls and code review processes for your Jekyll project.**
*   **Regularly audit your Jekyll configuration and dependencies for security vulnerabilities.**

By adhering to these recommendations, the development team can effectively mitigate the risk associated with the "Unsafe Mode Enabled" attack path and ensure the security of their Jekyll-based application. In modern Jekyll versions, this vulnerability is largely mitigated by default secure configurations, but vigilance and adherence to best practices remain crucial.
