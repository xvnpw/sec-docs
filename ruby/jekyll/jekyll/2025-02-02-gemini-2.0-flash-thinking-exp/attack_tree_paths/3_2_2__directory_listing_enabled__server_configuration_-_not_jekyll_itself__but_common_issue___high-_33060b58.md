### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.2.2.1. Expose `_site` directory contents if web server misconfigured [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Attack Path Title:** 3.2.2.1. Expose `_site` directory contents if web server misconfigured

**Parent Node:** 3.2.2. Directory Listing Enabled (Server Configuration - not Jekyll itself, but common issue) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:**

This attack path focuses on the risk of exposing the contents of the `_site` directory, which is the output directory generated by Jekyll containing the static website files.  The vulnerability arises from a misconfiguration in the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Caddy) hosting the `_site` directory. If directory listing is enabled on the web server for the `_site` directory (or its parent directories), an attacker can potentially browse the directory structure and list the files within it simply by accessing the directory URL in a web browser.

**Attack Vector:**

The attack vector is a **web browser**. An attacker simply needs to know or guess the URL of the `_site` directory (or a parent directory where directory listing is enabled).  Upon accessing this URL, if the web server is misconfigured, it will return an HTML page listing the files and subdirectories within that directory.

**Preconditions:**

*   **Web Server Misconfiguration:** The primary precondition is that the web server hosting the `_site` directory must be misconfigured to enable directory listing. This is often a default setting in some web server configurations or can be unintentionally enabled.
*   **Access to the `_site` directory URL:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the URL path to the `_site` directory on the target website. This is usually predictable as it's often the root directory of the website or a subdirectory like `/` or `/blog/`.
*   **Jekyll Application Deployed:** A Jekyll application must be deployed and its generated `_site` directory must be accessible by the web server.

**Impact:**

*   **Medium Impact - Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is **information disclosure**.  While directory listing itself might not directly lead to code execution or data breaches, it can reveal valuable information to an attacker, including:
    *   **Website Structure:**  Attackers can understand the organization of the website, including directory names, file names, and potentially infer the underlying technology and development practices.
    *   **File Names and Types:**  Listing files reveals the names and extensions of files, which can hint at sensitive information or potential vulnerabilities. For example, the presence of files like `.git/`, `.env`, `config.yml`, backup files (`.bak`, `~`), or database configuration files could be exposed (though Jekyll itself is static and less likely to have database config files directly in `_site`, misconfigurations could lead to other sensitive files being placed there).
    *   **Hidden Files and Directories:** Directory listing can expose files and directories that are intended to be hidden from public access, such as `.htaccess` files (if used in the `_site` directory for some reason), backup files, or temporary files.
    *   **Version Information:** File names or directory structures might inadvertently reveal version information of software or libraries used in the website generation process.
    *   **Content Preview:** In some cases, depending on the web server configuration and file types, clicking on listed files might allow the attacker to preview or download the file content directly, leading to further information disclosure. For example, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and image files would be directly accessible.

*   **Potential for Escalation:** While the immediate impact is medium, the information disclosed through directory listing can be used to facilitate further, more severe attacks. For example:
    *   **Finding Vulnerable Files:** Exposed file names might reveal the presence of older versions of libraries or scripts known to have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Identifying Sensitive Data:**  File names or directory names might hint at the location of sensitive data, even if not directly accessible through directory listing.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Understanding the website structure and file names can aid in crafting more targeted phishing or social engineering attacks.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this misconfiguration occurring is **Medium to High**, especially for developers or teams who are not fully aware of web server security best practices or are using default configurations.  It's a common oversight, particularly in development or staging environments that are accidentally exposed to the internet.  Automated security scanners often flag directory listing as a vulnerability.

**Severity:**

The severity is considered **HIGH-RISK PATH** in the provided attack tree, although the immediate impact is classified as "Medium". This is because while the direct impact is information disclosure, the *potential* for escalation and the ease of exploitation make it a significant risk.  It's a low-effort, high-reward vulnerability for attackers in terms of information gathering.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Disable Directory Listing:** The most effective mitigation is to **explicitly disable directory listing** in the web server configuration for the `_site` directory and its parent directories. This is a standard security best practice.

    *   **Nginx Example:**
        ```nginx
        server {
            root /path/to/your/_site;
            index index.html;

            # Disable directory listing
            autoindex off;

            # ... other configurations ...
        }
        ```

    *   **Apache Example (.htaccess or VirtualHost configuration):**
        ```apache
        <Directory "/path/to/your/_site">
            Options -Indexes
        </Directory>
        ```

    *   **Caddy Example (Caddyfile):**
        ```caddy
        example.com {
            root * /path/to/your/_site
            file_server browse off
            # ... other configurations ...
        }
        ```

2.  **Verify Web Server Configuration:**  Regularly review and verify the web server configuration to ensure directory listing is disabled. Use configuration management tools and infrastructure-as-code to enforce secure configurations consistently across environments.

3.  **Security Audits and Scanning:**  Include directory listing checks in regular security audits and vulnerability scans. Automated scanners can easily detect this misconfiguration.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that web server processes only have the necessary permissions to access the `_site` directory and no more. This limits the potential damage if other vulnerabilities are exploited.

5.  **Secure Default Configurations:**  Use secure default configurations for web servers and avoid relying on default settings that might enable directory listing.

6.  **Educate Development and Operations Teams:**  Train development and operations teams on web server security best practices, including the risks of directory listing and how to disable it.

**Example Scenario:**

1.  A developer deploys a Jekyll website to a production server using Nginx.
2.  During the deployment process, they forget to explicitly disable directory listing in the Nginx configuration for the `_site` directory. The default Nginx configuration might have `autoindex` set to `on` in certain contexts.
3.  An attacker discovers the website's URL and tries to access the root directory (`/`).
4.  Because directory listing is enabled, the web server returns an HTML page listing all files and directories within the `_site` directory.
5.  The attacker browses the directory listing and discovers a directory named `_config/`.
6.  Inside `_config/`, they find a file named `secrets.yml` (hypothetical example, not typical Jekyll structure, but illustrating the point).
7.  By clicking on `secrets.yml` in the directory listing, they can download the file and potentially gain access to sensitive information like API keys or database credentials (again, not typical for Jekyll, but illustrating the risk of information disclosure).
8.  Even if no sensitive files are directly exposed, the attacker gains valuable insights into the website's structure, file naming conventions, and potentially the technologies used, which can be used for further reconnaissance and targeted attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The "Expose `_site` directory contents if web server misconfigured" attack path, while seemingly simple, represents a significant security risk due to its ease of exploitation and potential for information disclosure.  Although the immediate impact is often classified as medium, the information gained can be leveraged for more serious attacks.  Disabling directory listing is a fundamental security best practice that should be implemented for all web servers hosting Jekyll applications (and indeed, any website).  Regular security audits and proper web server configuration management are crucial to prevent this vulnerability and maintain the security of Jekyll deployments.  Development and operations teams must be aware of this risk and prioritize its mitigation.
