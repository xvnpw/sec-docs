### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.4.1.1. Code execution during build process

#### 4.1. Attack Description

This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within Ruby gems that are dependencies of Jekyll or its plugins. During the Jekyll build process, Ruby gems are loaded and executed to perform various tasks, such as:

*   Parsing and processing content (Markdown, Liquid templates).
*   Generating website structure and assets.
*   Applying themes and layouts.
*   Executing plugin functionalities.

If a Ruby gem dependency contains a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution, an attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to execute malicious code on the build server **during the build process itself**.

**How the attack could unfold:**

1.  **Vulnerable Gem Identification:** The attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability in a Ruby gem that is a dependency of Jekyll or a popular Jekyll plugin. Vulnerability databases and security advisories are common sources for this information.
2.  **Dependency Chain Analysis:** The attacker determines if the target Jekyll application uses the vulnerable gem, either directly in its `Gemfile` or indirectly as a transitive dependency of another gem. Tools like `bundle audit` or `bundler-vuln` can assist in this analysis.
3.  **Exploit Development/Adaptation:** The attacker either finds an existing exploit for the vulnerability or develops a new one. Exploits often target common vulnerability types like:
    *   **Deserialization vulnerabilities:**  Unsafe deserialization of data can lead to code execution.
    *   **Command Injection vulnerabilities:**  Improper sanitization of user-controlled input passed to system commands.
    *   **Path Traversal vulnerabilities:**  Allowing access to files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to file inclusion and code execution.
    *   **SQL Injection vulnerabilities (less common in build process but possible):** If gems interact with databases during build.
4.  **Triggering the Vulnerability during Build:** The attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable code path within the gem during the Jekyll build process. This could be achieved by:
    *   **Crafting malicious input data:**  If the vulnerability is triggered by processing specific input (e.g., a specially crafted Markdown file, YAML configuration, or image).
    *   **Manipulating build configuration:**  If the vulnerability is triggered by specific configuration settings or plugin options.
    *   **Exploiting a vulnerability in how Jekyll or a plugin uses the gem:**  Even if the gem itself is not directly vulnerable in isolation, the way it's used within the Jekyll ecosystem might create an exploitable condition.
5.  **Code Execution on Build Server:** Upon successful exploitation, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the build server with the privileges of the user running the Jekyll build process.

#### 4.2. Likelihood

The likelihood of this attack path being successfully exploited is considered **HIGH** due to several factors:

*   **Prevalence of Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Software dependencies, including Ruby gems, are a common source of vulnerabilities. The Ruby ecosystem, while generally well-maintained, is not immune to security flaws.
*   **Complexity of Dependency Trees:** Jekyll projects often rely on a complex web of direct and transitive dependencies. This complexity increases the attack surface and makes it harder to track and manage all potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Publicly Available Vulnerability Information:** Vulnerability databases and security advisories make it relatively easy for attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in popular gems.
*   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** Attackers can use automated tools to scan Jekyll projects and their dependencies for known vulnerabilities, making the process efficient.
*   **Delayed Patching and Updates:** Development teams may not always promptly update their dependencies to the latest versions, leaving vulnerable gems in use for extended periods.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks are Increasing:**  Attacks targeting software supply chains, including dependency vulnerabilities, are becoming more frequent and sophisticated.

However, the likelihood can be reduced by implementing robust security practices (discussed in Mitigation Strategies).

#### 4.3. Impact

The impact of successful code execution on the build server is considered **CRITICAL** and **HIGH-RISK**.  Potential consequences include:

*   **Build Environment Compromise:** The attacker gains control over the build server. This allows them to:
    *   **Modify the build process:** Inject malicious code into the Jekyll website being built, leading to website defacement, malware distribution, or data theft from website visitors.
    *   **Steal sensitive information:** Access environment variables, configuration files, secrets, and credentials stored on the build server, potentially including API keys, database credentials, and deployment keys.
    *   **Establish persistence:** Install backdoors or create new user accounts to maintain persistent access to the build server.
    *   **Pivot to other systems:** Use the compromised build server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network, such as internal servers, databases, or development machines.
*   **Supply Chain Contamination:**  If the compromised build server is used to build and deploy software for multiple projects or clients, the attacker could potentially contaminate the entire supply chain, affecting a wide range of downstream users.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization, leading to loss of customer trust and business impact.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Depending on the nature of the data compromised and the industry, there could be legal and regulatory repercussions, including fines and penalties.

#### 4.4. Vulnerability Examples

While specific, actively exploited vulnerabilities change over time, here are examples of vulnerability types and past incidents in Ruby gems that illustrate the potential for code execution during build processes:

*   **CVE-2015-9284 (nokogiri gem):**  A vulnerability in the `nokogiri` gem (a common dependency for XML/HTML processing) allowed for arbitrary code execution through crafted XML documents. This could be triggered during Jekyll build if Jekyll or a plugin used `nokogiri` to process untrusted XML content.
*   **YAML Deserialization Vulnerabilities (various gems):**  Unsafe deserialization of YAML data in gems like `psych` (Ruby's default YAML parser) and others has been a recurring issue. If Jekyll or a plugin processes YAML configuration or data from untrusted sources using vulnerable gems, it could lead to code execution.
*   **Command Injection in Image Processing Gems (e.g., `mini_magick`, `rmagick`):** Image processing gems that wrap command-line tools like ImageMagick have historically been vulnerable to command injection if user-provided input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the command-line tool. If Jekyll plugins use these gems to process user-uploaded images during build, it could be exploited.
*   **Path Traversal in Archive Extraction Gems (e.g., `rubyzip`):** Gems for handling archive files (ZIP, TAR, etc.) can be vulnerable to path traversal if they don't properly validate filenames within archives. If Jekyll or plugins process user-provided archives during build, a malicious archive could be crafted to write files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to code execution.

**Note:** It's crucial to regularly check for and patch vulnerabilities in all dependencies, as new vulnerabilities are discovered frequently.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of code execution through dependency vulnerabilities during the Jekyll build process, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Dependency Scanning and Management:**
    *   **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:** Integrate tools like `bundle audit`, `bundler-vuln`, or commercial Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies to the latest versions, including patch updates that often contain security fixes.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use `Gemfile.lock` to pin dependency versions and ensure consistent builds. However, regularly review and update pinned versions to incorporate security patches.
    *   **Minimize Dependencies:**  Reduce the number of dependencies by carefully evaluating the necessity of each gem and considering alternative solutions that minimize external code.

2.  **Secure Build Environment:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the build process with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running builds as root or with overly permissive user accounts.
    *   **Isolated Build Environment:** Use containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtual machines to isolate the build environment from the host system and other environments. This limits the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Immutable Build Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure for build servers, where servers are replaced rather than patched. This reduces the window of opportunity for persistent attacks.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict network access from the build server to only necessary resources. Limit outbound connections and isolate the build network from sensitive internal networks.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Validate all external input:**  If Jekyll plugins or custom code process external data during build (e.g., user-uploaded files, data from external APIs), rigorously validate and sanitize this input to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing Jekyll plugins or custom build scripts to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited through dependencies.

4.  **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Jekyll project and its build process to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing, including simulating attacks targeting dependency vulnerabilities, to validate security controls and identify exploitable paths.

#### 4.6. Detection Methods

Detecting code execution attempts during the build process can be challenging but is crucial for timely response. Consider the following detection methods:

1.  **Build Log Monitoring:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:**  Collect and centralize build logs from the build server.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Analyze build logs for unusual patterns, errors, or suspicious commands being executed. Look for indicators like:
        *   Unexpected network connections.
        *   File system modifications outside of expected build directories.
        *   Execution of shell commands that are not part of the normal build process.
        *   Error messages related to security vulnerabilities or exploits.
    *   **Automated Log Analysis:** Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems or log analysis tools to automate the detection of anomalies in build logs.

2.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   **Network-based IDS/IPS:**  Monitor network traffic to and from the build server for malicious activity, such as exploit attempts or command-and-control communication.
    *   **Host-based IDS/IPS (HIDS):**  Install HIDS agents on the build server to monitor system activity, file integrity, and process execution for suspicious behavior.

3.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   **Monitor critical build directories:**  Implement FIM to monitor changes to critical files and directories on the build server, such as build scripts, configuration files, and gem installation directories. Unauthorized modifications could indicate a compromise.

4.  **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) (Less common in build process but potentially applicable):**
    *   In some advanced scenarios, RASP technologies could be used to monitor the behavior of the Jekyll build process at runtime and detect and prevent exploitation attempts.

5.  **Regular Security Assessments and Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Proactive and regular vulnerability scanning and security assessments are crucial for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path **"2.4.1.1. Code execution during build process"** represents a significant and critical risk to Jekyll applications. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Ruby gem dependencies during the build process can lead to severe consequences, including build environment compromise, supply chain contamination, and significant reputational and financial damage.

It is imperative for development teams to prioritize securing their Jekyll build process by implementing a layered security approach that includes:

*   **Proactive dependency management and vulnerability scanning.**
