### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2.1. Inject malicious data into site variables for later exploitation

#### 4.1. Understanding YAML Front Matter in Jekyll

Jekyll uses YAML Front Matter to define metadata and configuration for posts, pages, and collections. This front matter is placed at the beginning of a Markdown, HTML, or Text file, enclosed within triple-dashed lines (`---`). Jekyll parses this YAML and makes the data available as variables within Liquid templates.

**Example of YAML Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: My Awesome Post
date: 2023-10-27
author: John Doe
custom_variable: "This is a custom value"
---

This is the content of my post.
```

In this example, `layout`, `title`, `date`, `author`, and `custom_variable` are defined as variables that can be accessed in Liquid templates.

#### 4.2. YAML Front Matter Injection: The Vulnerability

The vulnerability arises when an attacker can control or influence the content of the YAML Front Matter. This could occur in scenarios where:

*   **User-Generated Content:** If Jekyll is used in a context where users can submit content (e.g., through a CMS or a system that processes user-provided Markdown files), and insufficient input validation is performed on the front matter.
*   **Compromised Data Source:** If the source of Jekyll content (e.g., a Git repository, a database) is compromised, an attacker could directly modify the YAML front matter in the source files.
*   **Vulnerable Plugins/Extensions:**  Potentially through vulnerabilities in Jekyll plugins or extensions that process or manipulate front matter data.

#### 4.3. 2.1.2.1. Inject malicious data into site variables for later exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This specific attack path focuses on injecting malicious data into the YAML front matter with the intention of having this data interpreted as site variables and subsequently exploited within Liquid templates.

##### 4.3.1. Attack Vector: Injecting Malicious Data into YAML Front Matter

The attacker's goal is to inject YAML code that, when parsed by Jekyll, will create site variables containing malicious payloads.  This malicious payload is designed to be harmful when later processed by Liquid templates.

**Example of Malicious YAML Injection:**

Imagine a scenario where an attacker can influence the `author` field in the YAML front matter. Instead of a simple name, they inject malicious code:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Vulnerable Post
date: 2023-10-27
author: "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS Vulnerability!\")'>"
---

This post demonstrates a vulnerability.
```

In this example, the attacker has injected an HTML `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler into the `author` field.  Jekyll will parse this YAML, and the value of `author` will become a site variable.

##### 4.3.2. Exploitation in Liquid Templates

Jekyll uses Liquid as its templating engine.  If Liquid templates are not carefully designed and do not properly handle user-controlled data (even indirectly through site variables derived from front matter), vulnerabilities can arise.

Consider a Liquid template that displays the author's name:

```liquid
<p>Post by: {{ page.author }}</p>
```

If the `page.author` variable contains the malicious HTML injected in the YAML front matter example above, the Liquid template will render it directly into the HTML output **without proper escaping or sanitization**.

**Resulting HTML Output (Vulnerable):**

```html
<p>Post by: <img src='x' onerror='alert("XSS Vulnerability!")'></p>
```

When a user's browser renders this HTML, the `onerror` event of the `<img>` tag will be triggered (because the image `src='x'` is invalid), and the JavaScript `alert("XSS Vulnerability!")` will execute. This demonstrates a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.

##### 4.3.3. Impact: Data Injection and XSS Vulnerability

The impact of successfully injecting malicious data into site variables can be significant:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** As demonstrated in the example, injected HTML or JavaScript code can be executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. This can allow attackers to:
    *   Steal user cookies and session tokens.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Inject further malicious content.
*   **Other Injection Vulnerabilities:** Depending on how the injected site variables are used in Liquid templates, other types of injection vulnerabilities might be possible. For example, if site variables are used to construct database queries (though less common in static site generators like Jekyll), SQL injection could theoretically be a concern in more complex scenarios or with custom plugins.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Attackers could inject data to manipulate the content or behavior of the website. For instance, they could inject code to alter links, modify displayed information, or inject spam content.

##### 4.3.4. Technical Details and Examples

**Example Scenario Breakdown:**

1.  **Attacker Injects Malicious YAML:** The attacker modifies the YAML front matter of a Jekyll post to include malicious HTML in the `author` field:

    ```yaml
    ---
    layout: post
    title: XSS Example
    author: "<script>alert('XSS!')</script>"
    ---
    ```

2.  **Jekyll Parses YAML:** Jekyll parses the YAML front matter and creates the `page.author` site variable with the injected malicious script.

3.  **Liquid Template Renders Vulnerable Code:** A Liquid template uses `{{ page.author }}` to display the author's name without proper escaping.

    ```liquid
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>By: {{ page.author }}</p>
    ```

4.  **Browser Executes Malicious Script:** When the page is generated and viewed in a browser, the injected `<script>` tag is executed, triggering the `alert('XSS!')`.

**Code Example (Illustrative - Vulnerable Liquid Template):**

```liquid
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>Author: {{ page.author }}</p> <!- VULNERABLE: No escaping -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of YAML Front Matter Injection leading to exploitation via site variables, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    *   **Strictly control the source of Jekyll content:** Limit who can modify content files and ensure secure access controls to the content repository.
    *   **If user-generated content is involved, implement robust input validation and sanitization for YAML front matter.**  This is critical.  Treat all data from external sources as potentially malicious.
    *   **Sanitize YAML front matter data before using it in Liquid templates.**  This can involve:
        *   **HTML Escaping:**  Use Liquid's `escape` filter or similar mechanisms to escape HTML entities in variables before rendering them in HTML contexts.  For example: `{{ page.author | escape }}`.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). This can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
*   **Secure Liquid Template Development:**
    *   **Always escape user-controlled data in Liquid templates:**  Treat all site variables derived from front matter as potentially user-controlled and escape them appropriately based on the context where they are used (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Avoid using `raw` or `unsafe` Liquid filters** unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. These filters bypass escaping and can directly render potentially malicious content.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Jekyll configurations, plugins, and Liquid templates to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to access control for Jekyll content and configuration files. Limit access to only authorized personnel.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep Jekyll and all plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and improvements.

#### 4.5. Risk Assessment

This attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK** because:

*   **High Likelihood (in vulnerable scenarios):** If user-generated content or compromised data sources are involved and input validation is lacking, the likelihood of successful exploitation is high.
*   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including XSS vulnerabilities, which can result in data breaches, website defacement, and malicious actions performed on behalf of users.
*   **Relatively Easy to Exploit (if validation is missing):** Injecting malicious YAML is often straightforward if input validation is not in place.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

The "YAML Front Matter Injection -> Inject malicious data into site variables for later exploitation" attack path represents a significant security risk in Jekyll applications, particularly when dealing with user-generated content or untrusted data sources.  The potential for XSS vulnerabilities through this path is high and can have serious consequences.

**It is crucial for the development team to prioritize mitigation strategies, especially input validation and output escaping in Liquid templates, to effectively prevent this type of attack and ensure the security of the Jekyll application.**  Regular security audits and adherence to secure development practices are essential for maintaining a secure Jekyll environment.
