# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Jekyll aims to provide a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites.
  - The primary goal is to enable users to create static websites quickly and efficiently from plain text files, offering a performant and secure alternative to dynamic content management systems for many use cases.
  - Key priorities include ease of use, flexibility through theming and plugins, and a robust, reliable core.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Jekyll could lead to compromised generated websites, impacting the reputation and availability of sites built with Jekyll.
  - Dependence on community contributions and maintainers for security updates and bug fixes.
  - Potential for insecure configurations or plugins created by users to introduce vulnerabilities into generated sites.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks through compromised dependencies (gems).

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Development - Jekyll is developed as an open-source project on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository and community contributions.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Jekyll uses Bundler to manage Ruby gem dependencies, providing a mechanism for specifying and resolving dependencies. Implemented in: Gemfile and Bundler.
  - security control: Static Site Generation - By generating static HTML files, Jekyll inherently reduces the attack surface compared to dynamic websites that require server-side processing for each request. Implemented in: Jekyll core functionality.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - Jekyll relies on third-party Ruby gems, which may contain security vulnerabilities. Mitigation relies on dependency updates and community reporting.
  - accepted risk: User Configuration Errors - Users may misconfigure Jekyll or their hosting environment, leading to security issues in their deployed sites. Mitigation relies on documentation and best practices.
  - accepted risk: Plugin Security - Plugins extend Jekyll's functionality but may introduce security vulnerabilities if not developed or reviewed securely. Mitigation relies on plugin author responsibility and user awareness.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems used by Jekyll.
  - recommended security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the Jekyll core codebase and critical plugins to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Secure Defaults and Best Practices Documentation - Enhance documentation to emphasize secure configuration practices and plugin usage, guiding users to avoid common security pitfalls.
  - recommended security control: Input Validation and Output Encoding - Reinforce input validation and output encoding practices within Jekyll core to prevent injection vulnerabilities in generated sites.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core Jekyll functionality as it is a static site generator. Authentication might be relevant for plugin development or integration with external services, but is not a primary concern for Jekyll itself.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is not a core requirement for Jekyll. Access control is typically managed at the hosting environment level for the generated static site.
  - Input Validation: Critical for processing user-provided content (Markdown, Liquid templates, data files) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting) in the generated static websites. Jekyll needs to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before being rendered into HTML.
  - Cryptography: Cryptographic functionalities are not a core requirement for Jekyll itself. However, plugins or themes might utilize cryptography for specific features (e.g., encrypting content, secure communication with external services). Jekyll core should not introduce unnecessary cryptographic complexity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Generating and publishing website content.
  - Maintaining website availability and integrity.
  - Ensuring the security of websites built with Jekyll to protect user reputation and data (if applicable, though primarily static content).
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Website Content: Generally public and not highly sensitive. However, integrity and availability are important.
  - Jekyll Configuration: May contain sensitive settings or API keys if plugins are used to integrate with external services.
  - Plugin Code: May contain sensitive logic or vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
  - Source Code Repository: Contains all website content and logic, requiring confidentiality and integrity to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are recommended for Jekyll projects?
  - Are there any official security guidelines or best practices documents for Jekyll development and deployment beyond general web security practices?
  - How does Jekyll handle plugin security and are there any mechanisms for plugin vetting or sandboxing?
- Assumptions:
  - Jekyll is primarily used for generating public-facing websites with static content.
  - Security concerns are focused on preventing vulnerabilities in the generated websites and the Jekyll generator itself.
  - Users are expected to follow general web security best practices when configuring and deploying Jekyll sites.
  - The primary security risks are related to input validation, template injection, dependency vulnerabilities, and insecure plugin usage.
