# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Jekyll and Ruby Gems](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_jekyll_and_ruby_gems.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Current Versions:** Check your `Gemfile.lock` or run `bundle outdated` in your project directory to list current Jekyll and Ruby gem versions.
    2.  **Check for Updates:** Visit the official Jekyll website ([https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and RubyGems.org ([https://rubygems.org/](https://rubygems.org/)) to find the latest stable versions of Jekyll and your gems.
    3.  **Update Gemfile:** Modify your `Gemfile` to specify the desired (latest stable) versions of Jekyll and other gems. Consider using version constraints (e.g., `~> 4.0`) to allow minor updates while preventing major breaking changes automatically.
    4.  **Run `bundle update`:** Execute `bundle update` in your terminal within the project directory. This command updates the gems according to your `Gemfile` and updates `Gemfile.lock`.
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, thoroughly test your Jekyll site locally to ensure all functionalities work as expected and no regressions are introduced.
    6.  **Regular Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to check for and apply updates. Integrate this into your maintenance process.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities in outdated Jekyll core or Ruby gems. This can lead to various attacks like Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** While less direct, outdated dependencies can be targeted in supply chain attacks. Keeping dependencies updated reduces the window of opportunity for attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by minimizing exposure to known vulnerabilities, but doesn't eliminate all supply chain risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of updates, but updates are often performed reactively when issues are encountered or during major feature releases, rather than on a regular proactive schedule.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Lack of a formalized, scheduled update process. No automated checks or alerts for outdated dependencies integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Bundler for Dependency Management](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_bundler_for_dependency_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure Bundler is Used:** Verify that your Jekyll project uses Bundler. This is typically indicated by the presence of a `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` in the project root. If not, initialize Bundler by running `bundle init`.
    2.  **Define Dependencies in Gemfile:** List all Jekyll dependencies, including Jekyll itself and any plugins, in the `Gemfile`. Specify version constraints as needed.
    3.  **Install Dependencies with Bundler:** Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies defined in the `Gemfile` and generate the `Gemfile.lock`.
    4.  **Use `bundle exec`:** Always use `bundle exec jekyll ...` to run Jekyll commands. This ensures that Jekyll and its plugins are executed within the Bundler environment, using the versions specified in `Gemfile.lock`.
    5.  **Commit `Gemfile.lock`:**  Always commit the `Gemfile.lock` file to version control. This ensures consistent dependency versions across development, staging, and production environments.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Dependency Version Mismatches (Medium Severity):** Inconsistent dependency versions across environments can lead to unexpected behavior, including security vulnerabilities that might be present in some versions but not others.
        *   **Unmanaged Dependencies (Low Severity):** Without Bundler, it's harder to track and manage dependencies, increasing the risk of using outdated or vulnerable gems unknowingly.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Dependency Version Mismatches (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring consistent environments and predictable behavior.
        *   **Unmanaged Dependencies (Low Impact):** Improves dependency management, making it easier to track and update, indirectly reducing the risk of using vulnerable gems.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Fully implemented. Bundler is used for dependency management in the project, and `Gemfile.lock` is committed to version control. `bundle exec` is generally used for Jekyll commands.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A - Bundler usage is consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dependency Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dependency_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Scanning Tool:** Select a suitable dependency scanning tool. Options include open-source tools like `bundler-audit` or commercial tools integrated into CI/CD platforms (e.g., Snyk, GitHub Dependency Scanning, GitLab Dependency Scanning).
    2.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Integrate the chosen scanning tool into your CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to run automatically on each commit or pull request.
    3.  **Configure Tool:** Configure the scanning tool to analyze your `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems.
    4.  **Set Alert Thresholds:** Define thresholds for vulnerability severity (e.g., only alert on high and critical vulnerabilities).
    5.  **Remediation Process:** Establish a clear process for addressing identified vulnerabilities. This includes updating vulnerable gems, investigating false positives, and documenting exceptions if vulnerabilities cannot be immediately fixed.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies before deployment, preventing exploitation.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** While not directly mitigating zero-days, dependency scanning helps quickly identify and address newly disclosed vulnerabilities in dependencies after they become public.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by providing automated detection and alerting for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Low Impact):** Provides early warning for newly disclosed vulnerabilities, enabling faster response.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic dependency checks are performed manually using `bundle audit` occasionally, but no automated scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated dependency scanning is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. No automated alerts or reports are generated for vulnerable dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Plugin Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_plugin_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Plugin List:**  List all Jekyll plugins currently used in your project (check `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`).
    2.  **Evaluate Necessity:** For each plugin, evaluate if its functionality is truly essential. Can the functionality be achieved through other means, such as Liquid templating, custom JavaScript/CSS, or by refactoring content?
    3.  **Remove Unnecessary Plugins:** Remove plugins that are not strictly necessary.
    4.  **Document Remaining Plugins:** For essential plugins, document their purpose and why they are required.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by decreasing the amount of third-party code used. Fewer plugins mean fewer potential points of vulnerability.
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Low Severity):** Minimizing plugin usage reduces the risk of accidentally including a malicious plugin, especially if plugins are sourced from less reputable locations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities introduced by plugins.
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Low Impact):** Slightly reduces the risk by decreasing the chance of including a malicious plugin.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Developers are generally mindful of plugin usage, but there hasn't been a formal review to minimize plugins specifically for security reasons.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal review process to minimize plugin usage. No documentation explicitly justifying the use of each plugin from a necessity perspective.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Vet and Audit Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_vet_and_audit_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Source Code Review:** Before using a new plugin, review its source code on platforms like GitHub. Look for any suspicious code patterns, potential vulnerabilities, or lack of security considerations.
    2.  **Author Reputation:** Research the plugin author's reputation and history in the Jekyll community. Check for reviews, community feedback, and whether the author is known for security-conscious development.
    3.  **Community Activity:** Check the plugin's repository for recent activity, issue reports, and pull requests. An actively maintained plugin is more likely to be secure and receive timely updates.
    4.  **Security Audits (If Possible):** For critical plugins, consider performing or commissioning a more formal security audit to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Test in Isolation:** Before deploying a new plugin to production, test it thoroughly in an isolated development environment to observe its behavior and ensure it doesn't introduce any unexpected security issues.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of using plugins containing malicious code, backdoors, or other harmful functionalities.
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and avoid plugins with known or potential security vulnerabilities before they are integrated into the project.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces the risk by proactively identifying potentially malicious plugins.
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces the risk by identifying and avoiding vulnerable plugins.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Developers generally check plugin descriptions and basic usage, but thorough source code reviews and security audits are not routinely performed. Author reputation and community activity are considered informally.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalized plugin vetting process with documented steps for source code review, author reputation checks, and community activity assessment. No security audits are performed for plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Plugins from Trusted Sources](./mitigation_strategies/use_plugins_from_trusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Official/Well-Known Plugins:** Favor plugins listed on the official Jekyll website or recommended by reputable members of the Jekyll community.
    2.  **Check Plugin Repository:** When choosing a plugin, prefer those hosted on well-known platforms like GitHub and with a clear project structure, documentation, and issue tracking.
    3.  **Verify Author/Organization:** Choose plugins developed by reputable individuals or organizations within the Jekyll ecosystem.
    4.  **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** Be cautious of plugins from unknown or less reputable sources, personal blogs, or file sharing sites.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Medium Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of using plugins intentionally designed to be malicious.
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Plugins from trusted sources are more likely to be developed with security in mind and receive timely security updates.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Plugins (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by choosing plugins from sources less likely to distribute malicious code.
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Low Impact):** Slightly reduces the risk by increasing the likelihood of using plugins that are better maintained and potentially more secure.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Developers generally prefer plugins from more visible sources, but there isn't a strict policy to only use plugins from "trusted" sources defined by specific criteria.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal definition of "trusted sources" for plugins. No documented policy to prioritize plugins from these sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Plugins Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_plugins_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Check for Updates:** Periodically check for updates to all Jekyll plugins used in your project. This can be done manually by checking plugin repositories or using tools like `bundle outdated`.
    2.  **Follow Plugin Maintainers:** Follow plugin maintainers or project repositories on platforms like GitHub to receive notifications about new releases and security updates.
    3.  **Update Plugins Promptly:** When updates are available, especially security updates, update your plugins promptly by updating your `Gemfile` and running `bundle update`.
    4.  **Test After Updates:** After updating plugins, thoroughly test your Jekyll site to ensure compatibility and no regressions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Addresses known security vulnerabilities in plugins by applying patches included in updates. Outdated plugins are a common target for exploitation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known plugin vulnerabilities.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Plugin updates are often performed reactively when issues are encountered or during major updates, but not on a regular proactive schedule specifically for security.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Lack of a scheduled, proactive plugin update process. No automated checks or alerts for outdated plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Jekyll Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/review_jekyll_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Review `_config.yml`:** Periodically review your `_config.yml` file (and any other configuration files like data files or custom configuration files).
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Information:** Look for any sensitive information that might have been inadvertently included in configuration files, such as API keys, passwords, or internal paths.
    3.  **Check for Misconfigurations:** Review configuration settings for any potential misconfigurations that could weaken security, such as overly permissive settings or insecure defaults.
    4.  **Remove Unnecessary Settings:** Remove any configuration settings that are no longer needed or are not essential for the site's functionality.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information stored in configuration files.
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Mitigates potential vulnerabilities arising from insecure or misconfigured settings.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure.
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities (Low Impact):** Slightly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Configuration files are reviewed during development and major updates, but not specifically and regularly for security vulnerabilities or sensitive information exposure.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No scheduled, dedicated security review of configuration files. No automated checks for sensitive information in configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_storing_sensitive_data_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify any sensitive data currently stored in Jekyll configuration files (e.g., API keys, passwords, secrets, internal URLs).
    2.  **Remove Sensitive Data:** Remove all sensitive data from `_config.yml` and other configuration files.
    3.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data as environment variables. Access these variables in your Jekyll templates or plugins using methods provided by your hosting environment or Ruby's `ENV` object.
    4.  **Consider Secure Vaults:** For more complex projects or sensitive environments, consider using secure vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage and access secrets securely.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data through version control, public repositories, or unauthorized access to configuration files.
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets (High Severity):** Eliminates the risk of hardcoding secrets directly in the codebase, which is a major security vulnerability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure.
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets (High Impact):** Eliminates the risk of hardcoded secrets.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Some sensitive data, like API keys for external services, are already managed using environment variables. However, other potentially sensitive configuration settings might still be present in configuration files.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full migration of all sensitive configuration data to environment variables or secure vault solutions. No comprehensive audit to identify and remove all sensitive data from configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **File System Permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions on Jekyll configuration files (`_config.yml`, data files, etc.) to restrict read and write access to only authorized users and processes (e.g., the web server user, authorized developers).
    2.  **Version Control Access Control:** If configuration files are stored in version control, implement access controls to limit who can access and modify the repository.
    3.  **Build Environment Access Control:** Restrict access to the Jekyll build environment (server, build tools, deployment scripts) to authorized personnel only.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Modification (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying configuration files, which could lead to site defacement, malicious content injection, or configuration changes that weaken security.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Restricting access to configuration files can indirectly reduce the risk of accidental information disclosure if sensitive data is still present in these files (though it's better to remove sensitive data altogether).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Modification (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces the risk of unauthorized configuration changes.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Low Impact):** Slightly reduces the risk of information disclosure (secondary benefit).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic file system permissions are in place on the production server. Version control access is generally restricted to development team members. Build environment access is somewhat restricted but could be further tightened.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal review and hardening of file system permissions specifically for Jekyll configuration files. More granular access control for the build environment.
