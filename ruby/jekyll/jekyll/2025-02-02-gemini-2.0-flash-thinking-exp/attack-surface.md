# Attack Surface Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Liquid](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_liquid.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Liquid templates, which is then executed on the server during site generation. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Jekyll Contribution:** Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine to process content.  The core functionality of Jekyll relies on Liquid, and vulnerabilities in how Liquid templates are handled directly expose this attack surface.  Improper handling of user-provided or external data within Liquid templates is a direct consequence of Jekyll's architecture.
*   **Example:** A developer uses a Liquid tag to directly embed unsanitized user input into a page: `{{ page.user_provided_data }}`. An attacker could inject malicious Liquid code within `page.user_provided_data`, such as `{% raw %}{% assign output = 'rm -rf /tmp/*' | system %}{% endraw %}`. During Jekyll build, this code could be executed on the server, potentially deleting files or causing other severe damage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Full control over the server during the Jekyll build process.
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive files and data on the server's file system.
    *   **System Compromise:** Potential for complete server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Never directly embed unsanitized user input or external data into Liquid templates. Sanitize and validate all data before use.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Always encode or escape data when outputting it in Liquid templates to prevent code injection. Utilize Liquid's built-in filters like `escape` or `cgi_escape` appropriately.
    *   **Secure Liquid Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines for Liquid templating. Avoid complex or dynamic template logic that increases the risk of injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Jekyll and Liquid Updates:** Keep Jekyll and the Liquid gem updated to the latest versions to patch known SSTI vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review with Security Focus:** Conduct thorough code reviews of Liquid templates, specifically looking for potential injection points and insecure data handling.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Highly Vulnerable Jekyll Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_highly_vulnerable_jekyll_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Jekyll plugins, if intentionally malicious or containing critical vulnerabilities, can severely compromise the security of the site generation process and the generated website.
*   **Jekyll Contribution:** Jekyll's plugin architecture is a core feature designed to extend functionality. This design inherently introduces an attack surface because Jekyll directly executes plugin code during the build process.  The trust placed in plugins is a direct aspect of Jekyll's extensibility model.
*   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful Jekyll plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin contains malicious code designed to inject a backdoor into every generated HTML page. Alternatively, a plugin might have a critical vulnerability, such as a path traversal flaw, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server during the build process by exploiting the plugin.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code on the server during build.
    *   **Backdoor Injection:**  Plugins can inject backdoors or malware into the generated website, compromising site visitors.
    *   **Data Theft:** Vulnerable plugins could allow attackers to steal sensitive data from the server or the generated website.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromised plugin repositories or developer accounts can lead to widespread distribution of malicious plugins affecting many Jekyll sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Only use plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources. Favor official Jekyll plugins or plugins from well-known, security-conscious developers and organizations.
    *   **Rigorous Plugin Vetting:**  Before installing *any* plugin, thoroughly vet it. Check the plugin's repository, developer reputation, community feedback, and recent activity.
    *   **Code Review (Plugin Source):**  If possible and practical, review the plugin's source code for any suspicious or malicious code patterns before installation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Plugins and Dependencies):** Regularly scan installed plugins and their Ruby gem dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security tools like `bundler-audit` and gem vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Plugins):** Install only essential plugins. Avoid plugins with broad permissions or excessive functionality if not strictly required.
    *   **Plugin Updates and Monitoring:** Keep installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities. Monitor for security advisories related to used plugins.
    *   **Consider Plugin Alternatives:**  Evaluate if the desired plugin functionality can be achieved through other, potentially safer methods (e.g., custom Liquid code, static site generators features) before relying on external plugins.
