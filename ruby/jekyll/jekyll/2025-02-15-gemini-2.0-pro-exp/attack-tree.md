```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Jekyll Configuration/Build Process [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_jekyll_configurationbuild_process__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that leverage misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in how Jekyll is set up and how the site is built. It's a high-risk area because configuration errors are common and can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Unsafe Configuration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__unsafe_configuration__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This sub-branch focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure settings in the Jekyll configuration, primarily in the `_config.yml` file.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. `safe: false`] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1___safe_false____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Jekyll's `safe` mode (enabled by default) restricts features like custom plugins and potentially dangerous Liquid tags. Setting `safe: false` disables these protections, significantly expanding the attack surface and allowing for arbitrary code execution if a vulnerability is found in a custom plugin or through a malicious Liquid tag.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Exposed Secrets] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__exposed_secrets___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack involves accidentally committing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials, etc.) into the Jekyll project's Git repository, either in the `_config.yml` file, data files, or other source files. Attackers can easily scan public repositories for these secrets.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the secret; could lead to data breaches, account takeovers, or server compromise.)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Jekyll Plugins/Themes [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_jekyll_pluginsthemes__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by third-party Jekyll plugins or themes. It's high-risk because many sites rely on external components, and vulnerabilities are frequently discovered in them.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Vulnerable Plugin/Theme [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__vulnerable_plugintheme__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This sub-branch represents attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate (but flawed) plugins or themes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Known CVE] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__known_cve___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack involves exploiting a publicly disclosed vulnerability (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in a Jekyll plugin or theme. Attackers often use automated scanners to find sites running vulnerable versions of software.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
            *   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the CVE; could range from minor information disclosure to complete server compromise.)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3. XSS in Theme]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3__xss_in_theme_.md)

*   **Description:** Themes, especially those handling user input or displaying external data, can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. While not *critical* in the same way as server compromise, XSS can still lead to significant damage.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
