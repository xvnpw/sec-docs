# Threat Model Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Jekyll plugin (Ruby code) and distributes it.  A user installs the plugin, and when Jekyll builds the site, the malicious code executes. The attacker's code could steal data, modify the generated site content, or even gain control of the build environment. This is a *direct* threat to Jekyll's plugin system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (exposure of sensitive information).
        *   Website defacement or content manipulation.
        *   Compromise of the build server or developer machine.
        *   Potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Plugins system (`_plugins` directory, plugin loading mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   **Code Review:** Manually inspect plugin source code before installation.
        *   **Plugin Whitelist:** Use the `plugins` array in `_config.yml` to explicitly list allowed plugins.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run Jekyll within a container (e.g., Docker).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Jekyll with the *minimum* necessary user privileges. Never as root/administrator.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated.

## Threat: [Compromised Plugin Dependency](./threats/compromised_plugin_dependency.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Plugin Dependency

    *   **Description:** A legitimate Jekyll plugin relies on a third-party Ruby gem.  The gem's repository is compromised, and a malicious version is published. When the Jekyll plugin is updated (or installed), it pulls in the compromised gem, leading to malicious code execution. This is a *direct* threat because Jekyll relies on the Ruby gem ecosystem for its plugins.
    *   **Impact:** (Same as Malicious Plugin Execution)
        *   Data breach.
        *   Website defacement.
        *   Build server compromise.
        *   Lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Jekyll Component:** Plugins system, Ruby gem dependency management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a `Gemfile.lock` to specify exact versions of all dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vendor Dependencies:** Consider vendoring dependencies.
        *   **Supply Chain Security:** Be aware of RubyGems ecosystem risks.
        *   **Sandboxing/Least Privilege:** (Same as above).

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in `_config.yml`](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in___config_yml_.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in `_config.yml`

    *   **Description:** A developer accidentally stores sensitive information (API keys, etc.) directly within the `_config.yml` file.  This file is often committed to the source code repository. While the repository itself isn't *part* of Jekyll, `_config.yml` is a *core* Jekyll configuration file, making this a Jekyll-specific threat.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach.
        *   Unauthorized access to external services.
        *   Potential financial loss or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Jekyll Component:** `_config.yml` (configuration file).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   **Git Ignore:** Ensure `_config.yml` (or any file with sensitive data) is *not* committed to the repository.
        *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Use Git hooks to scan for sensitive data.
        *   **Code Review:** Enforce code reviews.
