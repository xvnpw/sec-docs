# Deep Analysis: Data File (YAML) Poisoning in Jekyll

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with YAML poisoning in a Jekyll application, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide the development team with the information needed to prioritize and implement effective defenses.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface presented by Jekyll's use of YAML files, including:

*   **`_config.yml`:** The primary Jekyll configuration file.
*   **Front Matter:** YAML blocks at the beginning of Markdown files (posts, pages, etc.).
*   **Data Files:** YAML files stored in the `_data` directory.
*   **Plugins:**  Jekyll plugins that might process YAML data.  This is a *critical* expansion of the original scope, as plugins can introduce their own YAML parsing logic.
*   **Untrusted Input:**  Scenarios where YAML data might originate from external sources (e.g., user submissions, third-party integrations).  This is the *highest risk* area.

This analysis *excludes* other potential attack vectors unrelated to YAML parsing.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known vulnerabilities in the `psych` YAML parser (and any other parsers used by Jekyll or its plugins).  This includes searching CVE databases, security advisories, and exploit databases.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identify all dependencies that handle YAML parsing, including direct and transitive dependencies.  Determine their versions and patch levels.
3.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  Examine Jekyll's core code and relevant plugin code for how YAML files are loaded, parsed, and processed.  Look for potential weaknesses in input handling and error handling.
4.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic exploit scenarios based on identified vulnerabilities and Jekyll's architecture.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Develop detailed, practical mitigation strategies, prioritizing those with the highest impact and feasibility.
6.  **Tooling Recommendations:** Suggest specific tools and techniques for vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and sandboxing.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Vulnerability Research (Psych and Beyond)

*   **Psych (libyaml):**  `psych` is Ruby's default YAML parser, built on top of `libyaml`.  It has a history of vulnerabilities, including:
    *   **CVE-2013-1834:**  Denial of Service (DoS) via crafted YAML documents.
    *   **CVE-2014-2525:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via type confusion.
    *   **CVE-2014-9130:**  DoS via deeply nested structures.
    *   **CVE-2017-9860:**  RCE via crafted YAML documents.
    *   **CVE-2022-41854:** RCE via crafted YAML documents.
    *   **Many others:**  A thorough search of CVE databases is *essential*.  New vulnerabilities are regularly discovered.

*   **Other Parsers:**  Jekyll plugins *may* introduce other YAML parsers, either directly or through their dependencies.  These parsers *must* be identified and analyzed for vulnerabilities.  This is a common blind spot.

*   **Exploit Availability:**  Publicly available exploits exist for many `psych` vulnerabilities.  This significantly increases the risk, as attackers can easily adapt existing exploits.

### 4.2. Dependency Analysis

*   **`Gemfile.lock`:**  This file provides a precise snapshot of all gem versions used by the Jekyll project, including `psych` and any other YAML-related gems.  This is the *primary source* for dependency information.
*   **`bundle outdated`:**  This command lists outdated gems, highlighting potential security risks.
*   **Dependency Scanning Tools:**  Tools like `bundler-audit`, `snyk`, and GitHub's built-in dependency graph can automate vulnerability detection in dependencies.  These tools are *highly recommended*.

### 4.3. Targeted Code Review

*   **`Jekyll::Utils.load_yaml`:**  This is a likely entry point for YAML parsing in Jekyll's core.  Examine how this function handles errors and exceptions.
*   **`Jekyll::DataReader`:**  This class is responsible for reading data files from the `_data` directory.  Review how it interacts with the YAML parser.
*   **Front Matter Processing:**  Investigate how Jekyll extracts and parses YAML front matter from Markdown files.
*   **Plugin Code:**  *Crucially*, review any custom or third-party plugins for their YAML parsing logic.  Plugins often have less rigorous security reviews than the core Jekyll codebase.  Look for:
    *   Direct use of `YAML.load` or `Psych.load`.
    *   Use of other YAML parsing libraries.
    *   Lack of error handling around YAML parsing.

### 4.4. Exploit Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Untrusted Front Matter (RCE):**  An attacker submits a blog post (or other content) with a front matter containing a malicious YAML payload designed to exploit a known `psych` RCE vulnerability.  When Jekyll builds the site, the payload is executed, granting the attacker control of the build server.
*   **Scenario 2: Data File Poisoning (DoS):**  An attacker uploads a crafted YAML file to the `_data` directory (if write access is somehow obtained, perhaps through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).  This file contains a payload designed to trigger a DoS vulnerability in `psych`, causing the Jekyll build process to crash or consume excessive resources.
*   **Scenario 3: Plugin Vulnerability (RCE/DoS):**  A third-party Jekyll plugin uses a vulnerable YAML parsing library or has flawed YAML handling logic.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability through a crafted data file or front matter, leading to RCE or DoS.
*   **Scenario 4: _config.yml Manipulation (Various):** If an attacker can modify `_config.yml` (e.g., through a compromised account or a separate vulnerability), they can inject malicious YAML that could lead to various attacks, depending on how Jekyll uses the configuration values.

### 4.5. Refined Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Prioritize Parser Updates:**
    *   **Action:**  Immediately update `psych` (and `libyaml`) to the latest available versions.  This is the *most critical* and immediate mitigation.
    *   **Verification:**  Use `bundle outdated` and `Gemfile.lock` to confirm the updated versions are in use.
    *   **Automation:**  Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`, `snyk`) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and alert on outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

2.  **Safe YAML Loading (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Action:**  Replace `YAML.load` (and `Psych.load`) with `YAML.safe_load` (or `Psych.safe_load`) *everywhere* in the Jekyll codebase and *all* plugins.  `safe_load` disables potentially dangerous features of the YAML parser, significantly reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Caveat:**  `safe_load` may break functionality that relies on advanced YAML features.  Thorough testing is required.  If `safe_load` is not feasible, consider using a different, more secure YAML parser (see below).
    *   **Code Review:**  Conduct a thorough code review to ensure *all* instances of `YAML.load` have been replaced.

3.  **Alternative YAML Parsers (If Necessary):**
    *   **Action:**  If `safe_load` is insufficient or breaks critical functionality, investigate alternative YAML parsers like `Syck` (though it's older) or consider writing a custom, restricted YAML parser tailored to Jekyll's specific needs. This is a *major undertaking* but may be necessary for high-security environments.
    *   **Evaluation:**  Thoroughly vet any alternative parser for security vulnerabilities and compatibility with Jekyll.

4.  **Input Validation (Limited Applicability):**
    *   **Action:**  While full YAML validation is complex, implement *basic* structural validation where possible, especially for untrusted input.  For example, check for excessive nesting depth or unexpected data types.
    *   **Limitations:**  Input validation is *not* a complete solution for YAML poisoning, as it's difficult to anticipate all possible exploit vectors.  It should be used as a *supplementary* defense.

5.  **Sandboxing (Essential for Untrusted Input):**
    *   **Action:**  Run the Jekyll build process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, virtual machine) with *minimal privileges*.  This limits the impact of a successful exploit, preventing it from compromising the host system.
    *   **Configuration:**  Configure the sandbox to restrict network access, file system access, and system calls.
    *   **Tools:**  Docker is a highly recommended tool for sandboxing Jekyll builds.

6.  **Plugin Security Audits:**
    *   **Action:**  Conduct regular security audits of all third-party Jekyll plugins, focusing on their YAML parsing logic.
    *   **Policy:**  Establish a policy for vetting and approving plugins before they are used in the production environment.  Prioritize plugins with active maintenance and a good security track record.

7.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Action:**  Perform regular security audits of the entire Jekyll application, including code reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.

8.  **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *  **Action:** Ensure that the user account running the Jekyll build process has the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid running Jekyll as root or with administrative privileges.

### 4.6. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Dependency Analysis:** `bundler-audit`, `snyk`, GitHub Dependency Graph.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  OWASP ZAP, Nessus, Nikto (though these are more general web vulnerability scanners).
*   **Sandboxing:** Docker, VirtualBox, VMware.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Brakeman (for Ruby code security analysis).
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Run Jekyll in a test environment and use a fuzzer to send malformed YAML input.

## 5. Conclusion

YAML poisoning is a critical vulnerability in Jekyll due to its heavy reliance on YAML for configuration and data.  The primary risk comes from untrusted input, but vulnerabilities in the YAML parser itself (and in plugins) pose a significant threat.  Mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, including:

1.  **Immediate and continuous updates to the YAML parser (`psych` and `libyaml`).**
2.  **Using `YAML.safe_load` wherever possible.**
3.  **Sandboxing the Jekyll build process.**
4.  **Thorough security audits of plugins.**
5.  **Regular security assessments of the entire application.**

By implementing these strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of YAML poisoning and protect the Jekyll application from exploitation.
