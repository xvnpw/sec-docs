# Deep Analysis of Jekyll Attack Tree Path: Exploit Jekyll Configuration/Build Process

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, understand, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities related to the configuration and build process of Jekyll-based applications.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of the application.  This analysis focuses specifically on preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and code execution resulting from misconfigurations or build-time exploits.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis is limited to the following areas within the Jekyll ecosystem:

*   **`_config.yml` (and any included configuration files):**  This includes all settings defined in the main configuration file and any files it incorporates (e.g., via `includes` or custom plugins that load configuration).
*   **Plugin Security:**  Analysis of the security implications of using both official and third-party Jekyll plugins, focusing on how they interact with the build process and configuration.
*   **Build Environment:**  Examination of the environment in which the Jekyll site is built (e.g., local machine, CI/CD pipeline), including potential vulnerabilities introduced by the build tools and dependencies.
*   **Data Files (`_data` directory):**  How data files are processed and the potential for injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Front Matter Defaults:** How default values in front matter can be exploited.
* **Deployment Process:** How the built site is deployed and if this process introduces any vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   **Web Server Configuration:**  We assume the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is configured securely. This analysis focuses solely on the Jekyll build process.
*   **Client-Side Attacks (XSS, CSRF):** While important, these are outside the scope of this specific attack path, which focuses on the server-side build process.
*   **Physical Security:**  We do not consider physical access to the build server.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threat actors and their motivations for attacking the Jekyll configuration/build process.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Systematically examine each area within the scope for potential vulnerabilities, drawing from known Jekyll security issues, common configuration mistakes, and general secure coding principles.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  For each identified vulnerability, develop realistic exploit scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could leverage the weakness.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of each successful exploit, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigations for each identified vulnerability, prioritizing those with the highest impact and likelihood.
6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document all findings, exploit scenarios, and recommendations in this report.
7. **Review and Validation:** The analysis and recommendations will be reviewed by other members of the cybersecurity and development teams to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Jekyll Configuration/Build Process

This section details the specific vulnerabilities, exploit scenarios, impact, and mitigations.

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

**Threat Actors:**

*   **Script Kiddies:**  Unskilled attackers using publicly available tools and exploits.  Motivation:  Defacement, notoriety.
*   **Hacktivists:**  Attackers motivated by political or social causes.  Motivation:  Disrupting service, leaking information.
*   **Competitors:**  Attackers seeking to gain a competitive advantage.  Motivation:  Stealing intellectual property, disrupting service.
*   **Malicious Insiders:**  Individuals with authorized access to the build environment or configuration files.  Motivation:  Disgruntled employees, financial gain.
*   **Automated Bots:**  Scripts scanning the internet for vulnerable websites. Motivation:  Deploying malware, building botnets.

**Motivations:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive information stored in configuration files, data files, or the build environment.
*   **Code Execution:**  Injecting malicious code into the generated website to compromise visitors or the server.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the build process or making the website unavailable.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Altering the content of the website to display unwanted messages.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Causing harm to the organization's reputation through data breaches or website defacement.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Identification and Exploit Scenarios

This section breaks down specific vulnerabilities within the defined scope.

**2.2.1  `_config.yml` Misconfigurations**

*   **Vulnerability 1:  Exposure of Sensitive Information (API Keys, Secrets)**

    *   **Description:**  Storing API keys, database credentials, or other secrets directly in `_config.yml` without proper protection.  Jekyll processes this file and may expose these values in the generated HTML or through error messages.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker scans the generated `_site` directory or uses a tool to analyze the website's source code.  They find a JavaScript file that inadvertently includes the `site` object, exposing the API key stored in `_config.yml`.  The attacker then uses this key to access a third-party service, potentially incurring costs or accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  High (Confidentiality, Integrity).  Leads to unauthorized access to third-party services, potential data breaches, and financial loss.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use Environment Variables:**  Store sensitive information in environment variables on the build server and access them within `_config.yml` using `ENV['VARIABLE_NAME']`.  This prevents the secrets from being hardcoded in the repository.
        *   **Jekyll Plugins for Secret Management:**  Utilize plugins like `jekyll-dotenv` or `jekyll-secrets` to manage secrets securely. These plugins often integrate with environment variables or dedicated secret management services.
        *   **Configuration File Permissions:** Ensure the `_config.yml` file has restrictive permissions (e.g., `600` on Unix-like systems) to prevent unauthorized access.
        * **Exclude from build:** Use `exclude` option in `_config.yml` to prevent sensitive files from being copied to the output directory.

*   **Vulnerability 2:  Unsafe `safe: false` Setting**

    *   **Description:**  Setting `safe: false` in `_config.yml` disables Jekyll's security restrictions, allowing the execution of arbitrary Ruby code within plugins and templates.  This is extremely dangerous if untrusted code is present.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker gains access to the repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a supply chain attack on a plugin).  They modify a plugin or template to include malicious Ruby code that executes when the site is built.  This code could exfiltrate data, install malware, or compromise the build server.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  Allows for arbitrary code execution, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never use `safe: false` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**  Thoroughly vet any plugins or code used when `safe: false` is enabled.
        *   **Use a dedicated, isolated build environment:**  If `safe: false` is required, build the site in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container) to limit the impact of any potential compromise.
        *   **Code Review:**  Implement strict code review processes for all changes to plugins and templates, especially when `safe: false` is used.

*   **Vulnerability 3:  Misconfigured `include` and `exclude`**

    *   **Description:**  Incorrectly configuring the `include` and `exclude` options in `_config.yml` can lead to unintended files being included in or excluded from the build, potentially exposing sensitive information or creating unexpected behavior.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  A developer accidentally includes a directory containing backup files or configuration files with sensitive data by misconfiguring the `include` option.  These files are then published to the web server, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **Impact:**  Variable (Confidentiality).  Depends on the nature of the exposed files.  Could range from low (exposing internal file structure) to high (exposing credentials).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Carefully review and test `include` and `exclude` settings.**  Use specific file paths and patterns rather than broad wildcards.
        *   **Use a "whitelist" approach:**  Explicitly specify the files and directories that *should* be included, rather than relying solely on excluding unwanted files.
        *   **Regularly audit the generated `_site` directory:**  Check for any unexpected files or directories that should not be present.

**2.2.2 Plugin Security**

*   **Vulnerability 4:  Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins**

    *   **Description:**  Using outdated or poorly written third-party Jekyll plugins can introduce vulnerabilities into the build process.  Plugins have access to the Jekyll environment and can potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker discovers a vulnerability in a popular Jekyll plugin that allows for remote code execution.  They craft a malicious payload and target websites using this plugin.  When the site is built, the plugin executes the payload, compromising the server.
    *   **Impact:**  High to Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin.  Could range from data exfiltration to complete system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use only trusted and well-maintained plugins.**  Check the plugin's repository for recent updates, active maintenance, and a good reputation.
        *   **Regularly update plugins to the latest versions.**  This ensures that any known security vulnerabilities are patched.
        *   **Audit plugin code before use.**  If possible, review the source code of the plugin to identify any potential security issues.
        *   **Use a plugin security scanner.**  Tools can be developed or adapted to scan Jekyll plugins for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Limit plugin permissions:**  If possible, run plugins in a restricted environment with limited access to the file system and network.

*   **Vulnerability 5:  Supply Chain Attacks on Plugins**

    *   **Description:**  An attacker compromises the repository or distribution channel of a Jekyll plugin and injects malicious code.  Users who install or update the plugin unknowingly introduce the vulnerability into their build process.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker gains control of a popular Jekyll plugin's GitHub repository.  They modify the plugin's code to include a backdoor that allows them to remotely control websites using the plugin.  Users who update the plugin unknowingly install the compromised version.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  Allows for complete system compromise and widespread impact.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Verify plugin integrity:**  Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded plugins.
        *   **Use a package manager with security features:**  If using a package manager (e.g., Bundler for RubyGems), ensure it has features to verify package authenticity and integrity.
        *   **Monitor plugin repositories for suspicious activity:**  Be aware of any unusual commits, releases, or discussions in the plugin's repository.
        *   **Pin plugin versions:** Specify exact versions of plugins in your `Gemfile` to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.

**2.2.3 Build Environment**

*   **Vulnerability 6:  Compromised Build Server**

    *   **Description:**  If the server or environment where the Jekyll site is built is compromised, an attacker can inject malicious code or steal sensitive information.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker gains access to the CI/CD server used to build the Jekyll site (e.g., through a vulnerability in the CI/CD software or a compromised SSH key).  They modify the build script to include a malicious command that exfiltrates data or installs malware.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  Allows for complete system compromise and potential access to sensitive data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure the build server:**  Apply all security patches, use strong passwords, and restrict access to the server.
        *   **Use a dedicated, isolated build environment:**  Build the site in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) to limit the impact of a compromise.
        *   **Monitor build logs for suspicious activity:**  Regularly review build logs for any unusual commands or errors.
        *   **Implement least privilege:**  Ensure the build process has only the necessary permissions to access required resources.

*   **Vulnerability 7:  Dependency Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by Jekyll or its plugins (e.g., Ruby gems) can be exploited to compromise the build process.
    *   **Exploit Scenario:**  A vulnerability is discovered in a Ruby gem used by a Jekyll plugin.  An attacker crafts a malicious payload that exploits this vulnerability.  When the site is built, the vulnerable gem is loaded, and the attacker's payload is executed.
    *   **Impact:**  Variable (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Regularly update dependencies:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Bundler) to keep all dependencies up to date.
        *   **Use a vulnerability scanner:**  Tools like `bundler-audit` can scan your `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
        *   **Pin dependency versions:**  Specify exact versions of dependencies to prevent automatic updates to potentially vulnerable versions.

**2.2.4 Data Files (`_data` directory)**

* **Vulnerability 8: YAML Parsing Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Jekyll uses YAML for data files.  If the YAML parser has vulnerabilities, or if untrusted data is loaded into YAML files, it can lead to code execution.
    * **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker uploads a crafted YAML file to a form that is then processed and stored in the `_data` directory. This YAML file contains malicious code that exploits a vulnerability in the YAML parser (e.g., a known CVE in `psych` or a similar library). When Jekyll builds the site, it parses this malicious YAML file, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Allows for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Sanitize and Validate Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-supplied data *before* it is written to YAML files.  This includes checking for unexpected characters, data types, and structures.
        * **Use a Safe YAML Parser:** Ensure you are using a secure and up-to-date YAML parser.  Consider using a parser that explicitly disallows potentially dangerous features, like custom tags.  For Ruby, `YAML.safe_load` is generally recommended over `YAML.load`.
        * **Regularly Update YAML Parser:** Keep the YAML parsing library (e.g., `psych` in Ruby) updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.

**2.2.5 Front Matter Defaults**

* **Vulnerability 9:  Exploiting Default Values**

    * **Description:**  Front matter defaults in `_config.yml` can be used to set default values for variables in posts and pages.  If these defaults are not carefully considered, they can be exploited.
    * **Exploit Scenario:**  A developer sets a default value for a `layout` variable in `_config.yml`.  An attacker creates a post without specifying a layout, causing the default layout to be used.  If the default layout contains a vulnerability (e.g., it includes user-supplied data without proper sanitization), the attacker can exploit this to inject malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Variable (Confidentiality, Integrity). Depends on the specific vulnerability in the default layout or other default values.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Carefully review and test front matter defaults.**  Ensure that default values are safe and do not introduce any vulnerabilities.
        * **Avoid using user-supplied data in default values.**  If necessary, sanitize and validate any user-supplied data before using it in a default value.
        * **Use specific layouts and avoid relying on defaults where possible.**

**2.2.6 Deployment Process**

* **Vulnerability 10: Insecure Deployment Credentials**
    * **Description:** Weak or exposed credentials used during the deployment process (e.g., FTP passwords, SSH keys) can allow attackers to upload malicious files or modify the website.
    * **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker obtains the FTP credentials used to deploy the Jekyll site (e.g., through a phishing attack or by finding them in a leaked configuration file). They use these credentials to upload a malicious PHP file to the web server, which they then execute to gain control of the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Allows for complete server compromise.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Use strong, unique passwords for all deployment credentials.**
        * **Use SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication whenever possible.**
        * **Store deployment credentials securely.** Use a password manager or a dedicated secrets management service.
        * **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for deployment access.**
        * **Regularly rotate deployment credentials.**
        * **Use secure deployment methods:** Prefer SFTP over FTP, and consider using Git-based deployments with proper access controls.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Exploiting the Jekyll configuration and build process presents a significant attack surface.  The most critical vulnerabilities involve arbitrary code execution through misconfigurations (`safe: false`), vulnerable plugins, YAML parsing issues, and compromised build environments.  Data exfiltration is also a major concern, particularly through exposed secrets in `_config.yml` or unintended file inclusion.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege throughout the entire Jekyll workflow.  The build process, plugins, and deployment scripts should have only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Implement multiple layers of security controls to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Jekyll configuration, plugins, build environment, and deployment process.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers and anyone involved in the Jekyll workflow about the potential security risks and best practices.
*   **Automated Security Testing:**  Incorporate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process. This could include static analysis of configuration files, dependency vulnerability scanning, and dynamic analysis of the generated website.
* **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest Jekyll security advisories and best practices. Subscribe to security mailing lists and follow relevant security researchers.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks targeting the Jekyll configuration and build process, enhancing the overall security of the application.
