# Deep Analysis of Jekyll Attack Tree Path: `safe: false`

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the security implications of setting `safe: false` in a Jekyll configuration, understand the potential attack vectors it opens, assess the risks associated with those vectors, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide the development team with actionable insights to prevent exploitation through this configuration.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path originating from the configuration setting `safe: false` within a Jekyll-based application.  It encompasses:

*   The direct consequences of disabling `safe` mode.
*   The types of vulnerabilities that become exploitable.
*   The potential impact of successful exploitation.
*   Specific attack scenarios related to custom plugins and Liquid tags.
*   Mitigation techniques and best practices.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to the `safe` setting (e.g., network-level attacks, server misconfigurations outside of Jekyll).
*   Vulnerabilities in Jekyll's core code when `safe` mode is *enabled*.
*   Attacks that do not leverage the expanded attack surface provided by `safe: false`.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Technical Explanation:**  Provide a detailed technical explanation of how `safe: false` works and its impact on Jekyll's security model.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Identify specific types of vulnerabilities that become exploitable when `safe: false` is set.  This includes researching known vulnerabilities and attack patterns.
3.  **Attack Scenario Development:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Assess the potential impact of successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose concrete mitigation strategies, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and security best practices.
6. **Detection Strategies:** Propose detection strategies, that can help identify malicious activity.
7.  **Risk Assessment:** Summarize the overall risk associated with `safe: false`, considering likelihood and impact.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: `safe: false`

### 2.1 Technical Explanation

Jekyll's `safe` mode is a crucial security feature designed to prevent the execution of potentially malicious code within a Jekyll site.  When `safe: true` (the default), Jekyll restricts the following:

*   **Custom Plugins:**  Jekyll plugins (written in Ruby) allow developers to extend Jekyll's functionality.  In `safe` mode, custom plugins are *disabled*.  This prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary Ruby code into the site's build process.
*   **Dangerous Liquid Tags:**  Liquid is a templating language used by Jekyll.  Certain Liquid tags and filters can be abused to access system resources or execute commands.  `safe` mode restricts the use of these potentially dangerous tags and filters.  Specifically, it prevents the use of tags that could read arbitrary files or execute shell commands.
* **Symbolic Links:** Jekyll will not follow symbolic links, when `safe` mode is enabled.

Setting `safe: false` disables all these protections.  This means:

*   **Arbitrary Ruby Code Execution (via Plugins):**  An attacker who can introduce a malicious custom plugin (e.g., by compromising a developer's machine, submitting a pull request with a hidden backdoor, or exploiting a vulnerability in a legitimate plugin) can execute arbitrary Ruby code on the server during the site build process.  This grants the attacker full control over the server.
*   **Exploitation of Unsafe Liquid Tags:**  An attacker who can inject malicious Liquid code (e.g., through a compromised content file, a cross-site scripting vulnerability, or a vulnerability in a plugin that processes user input) can potentially read arbitrary files, execute shell commands, or perform other dangerous actions.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Identification

The following vulnerabilities become exploitable when `safe: false` is set:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via Custom Plugins:** This is the most critical vulnerability.  A malicious plugin can contain arbitrary Ruby code that will be executed with the privileges of the user running the Jekyll build process.  This can lead to complete server compromise.
    *   **Example:** A plugin could contain code to open a reverse shell, install malware, exfiltrate data, or modify system files.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Liquid Tags:**  Certain Liquid tags, when not properly sanitized, can be used to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker might use a tag like `{% include '../../../../etc/passwd' %}` to attempt to read the system's password file.  While Jekyll's `safe` mode would normally block this, `safe: false` allows it.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Liquid Tags:**  In some cases, specially crafted Liquid tags can be used to execute shell commands. This is less common than LFI but significantly more dangerous.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might find a way to inject a Liquid tag that uses Ruby's `system` or `exec` functions to run arbitrary commands.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** A malicious plugin or Liquid template could be designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Example:** A plugin could contain an infinite loop or allocate large amounts of memory.
* **Symbolic Link Attacks:** If symbolic links are allowed, an attacker could create a symbolic link to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and then use a Liquid tag to read the contents of the link, effectively bypassing file system permissions.

### 2.3 Attack Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Malicious Plugin via Compromised Developer Account**

1.  **Attacker Goal:** Gain complete control of the web server.
2.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker compromises a developer's GitHub account (e.g., through phishing, password reuse, or a stolen SSH key).
    *   The attacker creates a new branch in the Jekyll repository.
    *   The attacker adds a malicious custom plugin to the `_plugins` directory.  This plugin contains a Ruby reverse shell payload.
    *   The attacker creates a pull request to merge the malicious plugin into the main branch.
    *   An unsuspecting developer reviews and merges the pull request.
    *   The next time the Jekyll site is built (either manually or automatically), the malicious plugin is executed.
    *   The reverse shell connects back to the attacker's machine, granting them a command-line interface on the server.
    *   The attacker escalates privileges and gains full control of the server.

**Scenario 2:  LFI via Malicious Content Injection**

1.  **Attacker Goal:**  Read sensitive configuration files from the server.
2.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies a vulnerability in the Jekyll site that allows them to inject content (e.g., a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a comment form, or a vulnerability in a plugin that processes user-submitted data).
    *   The attacker injects a malicious Liquid tag designed to read a sensitive file.  For example: `{% include '../../../../etc/jekyll/config.yml' %}` (assuming the configuration file is located in a predictable location).
    *   The Jekyll site is rebuilt, and the malicious tag is processed.
    *   The contents of the configuration file are included in the generated HTML output.
    *   The attacker views the source code of the generated page and retrieves the sensitive information.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation of vulnerabilities enabled by `safe: false` is **Very High**.

*   **Confidentiality:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data, including user credentials, database passwords, API keys, and proprietary information.
*   **Integrity:**  Attackers can modify website content, deface the site, inject malicious scripts, or alter system configurations.
*   **Availability:**  Attackers can cause a denial of service by deleting files, shutting down the server, or consuming excessive resources.
* **Complete Server Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario (arbitrary code execution), the attacker gains full control of the server, allowing them to use it for any malicious purpose, including launching further attacks, hosting malware, or participating in botnets.

### 2.5 Mitigation Recommendations

The primary and most crucial mitigation is to **never set `safe: false` in a production environment.**  If custom plugins or potentially unsafe Liquid tags are absolutely necessary, consider the following:

1.  **Strict Code Review:**  Implement a rigorous code review process for all custom plugins and any code that handles user input.  This review should be performed by multiple developers with security expertise.
2.  **Sandboxing:**  Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate the Jekyll build process from the rest of the system.  This could involve running Jekyll in a container (e.g., Docker) or a virtual machine with limited privileges.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the user account running the Jekyll build process has the minimum necessary privileges.  Do not run Jekyll as root.
4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent the injection of malicious Liquid code.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible, allowing only known-safe characters and patterns.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Jekyll site and its dependencies, including custom plugins and third-party libraries.
6.  **Dependency Management:**  Keep all dependencies (including Jekyll itself and any gems used by plugins) up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to help detect and block malicious requests, including attempts to exploit Liquid tag vulnerabilities.
8. **Alternative Architectures:** If custom plugins are essential, consider alternative architectures that separate the plugin execution from the main web server. For example, you could use a separate service to pre-process content or generate static assets, reducing the risk to the main Jekyll site.
9. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If you don't need custom plugins, ensure they are completely disabled. If you don't need certain Liquid tags, consider using a more restrictive configuration or a custom Liquid parser that blocks potentially dangerous tags.

### 2.6 Detection Strategies

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to monitor changes to critical files, including the `_config.yml` file, the `_plugins` directory, and any files containing Liquid templates.  Unexpected changes could indicate a compromise.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor server logs (web server logs, system logs, Jekyll build logs) for suspicious activity, such as errors related to plugin execution, unusual file access patterns, or unexpected network connections.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for malicious patterns, including attempts to exploit known Jekyll vulnerabilities.
*   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools to scan custom plugins and Liquid templates for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Audit Jekyll Build Output:** Regularly review the generated HTML output of the Jekyll site for unexpected content or code that might indicate a successful injection attack.

### 2.7 Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Given the ease of exploitation if `safe: false` is set and the potential for developer account compromise or content injection vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service).
*   **Overall Risk:** High.  The combination of a medium likelihood and a very high impact results in a high overall risk.  This configuration should be avoided at all costs in production environments.

## 3. Conclusion

Setting `safe: false` in a Jekyll configuration significantly increases the attack surface and exposes the application to severe vulnerabilities, including arbitrary code execution.  This configuration should be strictly avoided in production environments.  If custom plugins or potentially unsafe Liquid tags are required, robust mitigation strategies, including sandboxing, strict code review, and input validation, must be implemented to minimize the risk.  The potential impact of a successful attack is too high to justify the convenience of disabling `safe` mode.
