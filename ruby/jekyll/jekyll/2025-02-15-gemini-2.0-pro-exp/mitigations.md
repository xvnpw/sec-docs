# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Plugin Selection and Management](./mitigation_strategies/careful_plugin_selection_and_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous selection, vetting, and updating of Jekyll plugins.

**Description:**
1.  **Establish a Plugin Review Process:** Before adding *any* plugin, the development team must:
    *   Review the plugin's source code on GitHub (or the source repository). Look for signs of good coding practices, security awareness (e.g., input sanitization), and recent activity.
    *   Check the plugin's issue tracker for unresolved security issues or reports of vulnerabilities.
    *   Search for any known vulnerabilities associated with the plugin (e.g., using Google, security advisories).
    *   Document the rationale for choosing the plugin, including its security assessment.
2.  **Use Bundler for Dependency Management:**
    *   All plugins should be managed through a `Gemfile`. This ensures consistent versions across development and production environments.
    *   Run `bundle install` to install the specified versions.
    *   Use `bundle update <plugin_name>` to update a specific plugin.  *Always* review the changelog before updating.
    *   Run `bundle audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities in the gem dependencies.
3.  **Automated Update Checks:**
    *   Integrate a system (e.g., a CI/CD pipeline task, a scheduled script) to automatically check for plugin updates. This could be a simple script that checks the GitHub API for new releases.
    *   Alert the development team when updates are available.
4.  **Plugin Removal:**
    *   Regularly review the list of installed plugins. Remove any plugins that are no longer needed or have become unmaintained.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):**  Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through outdated, poorly maintained, or malicious plugins.  This includes vulnerabilities like XSS, remote code execution (RCE), and data breaches *specifically introduced by the Jekyll plugin*.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):**  Mitigates the risk of a compromised plugin repository or a malicious update being pushed to a legitimate plugin *that is used by Jekyll*.

**Impact:**
*   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities *through Jekyll plugins*.  The impact is high, as it prevents potentially severe security incidents.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Reduces the risk, but doesn't eliminate it entirely (as a truly sophisticated attack might still succeed).  The impact is moderate to high, *specifically related to the Jekyll build process*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are used for dependency management.
*   Basic plugin review is performed (checking for recent activity on GitHub).
*   `bundle audit` is run manually, occasionally.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formalized plugin review process with documented security assessments.
*   Automated update checks and notifications.
*   Regular review and removal of unused plugins.
*   No integration of `bundle audit` into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management (Jekyll-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management__jekyll-specific_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Protect sensitive information in Jekyll's configuration files (`_config.yml` and related files) by using environment variables.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Jekyll-Specific Sensitive Data:**  Create a list of all sensitive data used *specifically within Jekyll's configuration* (e.g., API keys used by Jekyll plugins, deployment settings *within* `_config.yml`).
2.  **Use Environment Variables:**
    *   Store all sensitive data *that Jekyll needs to access* in environment variables, *never* directly in `_config.yml` or other committed files.
    *   Access these variables in Jekyll using the `ENV` hash (e.g., `ENV['MY_JEKYLL_PLUGIN_API_KEY']`).
3.  **Local Development Setup:**
    *   Use a `.env` file (or similar mechanism) to manage environment variables *locally* during development.  **Important:**  Ensure that `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
    *   Provide clear instructions to developers on how to set up their local environment variables *for Jekyll*.
4. **`.gitignore` Review (Jekyll Focus):**
    *   Regularly review the `.gitignore` file to ensure it includes all files and directories that should be excluded, *specifically focusing on Jekyll-related files* (e.g., `.env`, `_config_secrets.yml`, temporary files generated by Jekyll).
5.  **Output Directory Inspection:**
    *   After building the site with Jekyll, manually inspect the `_site` directory (or your configured output directory) to confirm that no sensitive files or data have been accidentally included *by Jekyll's build process*.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information *used by Jekyll* through configuration files, which could lead to account compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.
*   **Credential Theft (Severity: Critical):** Protects API keys and other credentials *used by Jekyll plugins or in the Jekyll build process* from being stolen by attackers.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exposure:**  Very high impact.  This is a fundamental security practice *for Jekyll*.
*   **Credential Theft:** Very high impact.  Directly prevents credential compromise *related to Jekyll*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `.gitignore` is configured to exclude `.env` files.
*   Some environment variables are used for deployment.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive use of environment variables for *all* sensitive data *used by Jekyll*.
*   Clear documentation for developers on setting up local environment variables *for Jekyll*.
*   Regular review of the `_site` directory after Jekyll builds.
*   No formal process for identifying and classifying sensitive data *specific to Jekyll*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of Drafts and Future Posts (Jekyll Features)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_drafts_and_future_posts__jekyll_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Prevent unintentional exposure of unpublished content using Jekyll's built-in features correctly.

**Description:**
1.  **`--drafts` Flag Usage:**
    *   Use the `--drafts` flag with the `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve` commands *only* during local development and testing.  *Never* use it on the production server.
    *   Document this clearly for all developers.
2.  **Build Process Review (Jekyll Focus):**
    *   Regularly review the Jekyll build process to ensure that drafts and future posts are handled correctly by Jekyll and are not inadvertently included in the production build *due to Jekyll misconfiguration*.
3.  **Automated Testing (Jekyll-Specific):**
    *   Consider adding automated tests to your CI/CD pipeline to verify that drafts and future posts are not accessible on the production site *due to errors in Jekyll's handling of these features*.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents premature release of information intended for later publication *due to incorrect use of Jekyll's features*.  The severity depends on the sensitivity of the unpublished content.
*   **Content Leaks (Severity: Low to Medium):**  Reduces the risk of leaking unfinished or confidential content *because of Jekyll misconfiguration*.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Moderate impact.  Prevents embarrassing leaks or potential competitive disadvantages *caused by Jekyll*.
*   **Content Leaks:** Moderate impact.  Protects sensitive information *from being exposed by Jekyll*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Developers are generally aware of the `--drafts` flag and its implications.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal documentation on the use of `--drafts` *within the Jekyll context*.
*   Automated tests to verify the handling of drafts and future posts *by Jekyll*.
*   Regular review of the Jekyll build process *from a security perspective*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in User-Provided Content (Jekyll Context)](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_user-provided_content__jekyll_context_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize user-provided content *within Jekyll templates and plugins* to prevent XSS.

**Description:**
1. **Identify Input Points (Jekyll):** Identify all places where user input is accepted *and processed by Jekyll* (e.g., comment forms that use a Jekyll plugin for handling, search fields processed by a Jekyll plugin).
2. **Input Validation (Jekyll Plugins):**
    * If using Jekyll plugins that handle user input, ensure those plugins perform strict input validation. If developing custom plugins, include robust input validation.
3. **HTML Sanitization (Jekyll Plugins and Templates):**
    * Use a robust HTML sanitizer *within any Jekyll plugins that handle user input*.
    * If rendering user input directly in Jekyll templates, use a well-vetted Liquid filter or a dedicated sanitization library.
    * Configure the sanitizer to allow only a specific whitelist of safe HTML tags and attributes.
4. **Output Encoding (Jekyll Templates):**
    * Use appropriate Liquid filters (e.g., `escape`, `escape_once`) to encode user-provided content when it's displayed on the page *within Jekyll templates*. This prevents HTML injection even if the sanitization step is bypassed.
5. **Regular Testing (Jekyll Focus):**
    * Regularly test your *Jekyll site and any custom plugins* for XSS vulnerabilities.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into your site *through user input processed by Jekyll or its plugins*.

**Impact:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Very high impact. XSS is a common and serious web vulnerability, and this mitigation focuses on preventing it *within the Jekyll context*.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Basic use of `escape` filter in some Jekyll templates.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Comprehensive input validation and sanitization using a dedicated library *within Jekyll plugins*.
* Consistent use of output encoding in all Jekyll templates.
* Regular security testing for XSS vulnerabilities *specifically targeting Jekyll components*.
* No formal process to identify all input points *within Jekyll*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Liquid Template Injection Prevention (Jekyll-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/liquid_template_injection_prevention__jekyll-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Prevent attackers from injecting malicious Liquid code through user input *within Jekyll templates*.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All User Input (Jekyll Templates):**  Carefully identify all points where user-supplied data is used within *Jekyll's Liquid templates*.
2.  **Avoid Direct Rendering:**  *Never* directly embed user input within Liquid tags or filters without proper sanitization *within Jekyll templates*.  For example, *do not* do this: `{{ user_input }}` without escaping.
3.  **Use Appropriate Liquid Filters:**
    *   Use `escape` for HTML attributes: `<a href="{{ user_provided_url | escape }}">Link</a>`
    *   Use `escape_once` to prevent double-escaping: `{{ user_comment | escape_once }}`
    *   Use `strip_html` to remove all HTML tags: `{{ user_comment | strip_html }}`
    *   Use `jsonify` for data that will be used in JavaScript: `<script>var data = {{ user_data | jsonify }};</script>`
    *   These filters are *part of Jekyll's Liquid implementation*.
4.  **Strict Input Validation (Before Jekyll):**
    *   Implement rigorous input validation to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected formats and lengths.  Reject any input that doesn't meet these criteria *before* it reaches the Jekyll template.
5.  **Context-Aware Escaping:**  Always consider the context in which the data will be used *within the Jekyll template* and choose the appropriate escaping method.
6.  **Regular Code Review (Jekyll Templates):**  Regularly review your *Jekyll Liquid templates* to ensure that user input is being handled safely.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Liquid Template Injection (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Liquid code *into Jekyll templates*, which could lead to arbitrary code execution (on the server during build), data leakage, or cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):**  If an attacker can inject arbitrary Liquid code *into a Jekyll template*, they might be able to execute commands on the server (during the Jekyll build process).
*   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):**  Attackers could use Liquid injection *within Jekyll* to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Impact:**
*   **Liquid Template Injection:** Very high impact.  This is a critical vulnerability *specific to Jekyll's templating system*.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Critical impact.  This could lead to complete server compromise *during the Jekyll build*.
*   **Data Leakage:** High impact.  Could expose sensitive information *accessible to Jekyll*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some use of `escape` in Jekyll templates.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive and consistent use of appropriate Liquid filters for all user input *within Jekyll templates*.
*   Strict input validation before data reaches the Jekyll templates.
*   Regular code reviews focused on Liquid template security *within Jekyll*.
*   Formal process to identify all user input points in Jekyll templates.
