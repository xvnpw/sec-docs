# Attack Surface Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Jekyll plugins (official, community, or custom) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data during the build process.
*   **Jekyll's Contribution:** Jekyll's plugin architecture allows for extensive customization, but this flexibility introduces a significant attack surface if plugins are not carefully vetted and secured.  This is a *core* Jekyll feature.
*   **Example:** A plugin designed to resize images contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to upload a specially crafted image file that, when processed, executes arbitrary shell commands on the build server.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, potential for persistent backdoors.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly research and vet all plugins before use.  Prioritize well-maintained, widely-used plugins with a good security history.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Plugin Whitelisting:** If possible, use a plugin whitelist to restrict which plugins can be loaded.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the Jekyll build process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, restricted user account) to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
    *   **Code Review:** Review the source code of plugins, especially custom or less-known ones, for potential security flaws.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `bundle audit`).

## Attack Surface: [Data File (YAML) Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/data_file__yaml__poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the YAML parser to achieve code execution or denial of service by providing maliciously crafted YAML files.
*   **Jekyll's Contribution:** Jekyll relies *heavily* on YAML for configuration (`_config.yml`) and data files. This is a fundamental aspect of how Jekyll operates.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a blog post with a front matter containing a specially crafted YAML payload that triggers a vulnerability in the `psych` YAML parser, leading to remote code execution on the build server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, potential for data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parser Updates:** Ensure the underlying YAML parser (e.g., `psych`) is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Input Validation:** If possible, validate the structure and content of YAML files before parsing them, especially if they originate from untrusted sources.
    *   **Safe YAML Parsers:** Consider using a more secure YAML parser if available and compatible with Jekyll.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the Jekyll build process in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Liquid Template Injection (Limited Scope)](./attack_surfaces/liquid_template_injection__limited_scope_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into Liquid templates, primarily through custom filters or tags, or through misuse of existing features.
*   **Jekyll's Contribution:** Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine, which is generally safe, but custom extensions or improper usage *directly within Jekyll's templating system* can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A custom Liquid filter designed to format dates is implemented insecurely, allowing an attacker to pass arbitrary shell commands through a specially crafted date string *processed by Jekyll*.
*   **Impact:** Potential for limited code execution (within the context of the build process), data exposure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if custom filters/tags are used insecurely)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid creating custom Liquid filters or tags that execute system commands or perform other potentially dangerous operations.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review and test any custom Liquid code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate any user-supplied data used within Liquid templates, especially in custom filters or tags.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Extensions:** Be cautious when using third-party Liquid extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Processor Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_processor_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Markdown processor (e.g., Kramdown) to achieve code execution or denial of service.
* **Jekyll's Contribution:** Jekyll *directly uses* a Markdown processor to convert Markdown content to HTML. This is a core part of Jekyll's build process.
* **Example:** An attacker submits a blog post with specially crafted Markdown that triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in Kramdown, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution *during Jekyll's build*.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep Processor Updated:** Ensure the Markdown processor (e.g., Kramdown) is updated to the latest version.
    * **Alternative Processors:** Consider using a different Markdown processor if one is known to be more secure or has a better security track record.
