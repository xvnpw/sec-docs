# Attack Surface Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Attack Surface: [Liquid Template Injection (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/liquid_template_injection__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Liquid code into templates or data files that are then processed by the Liquid rendering engine.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language as a core mechanism for generating dynamic content during the build process. This makes it vulnerable if user-controlled data (directly or indirectly) is rendered without proper escaping, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server during the build.
    *   **Example:** A malicious author could contribute a data file containing `{"setting": "{{ system 'rm -rf /' }}"}` and a template using `{{ site.data.config.setting }}`. During the build, this could execute the dangerous command on the build server.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Allows for arbitrary code execution on the server during the build process, potentially leading to complete server compromise, data breaches, and malicious modifications to the generated website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly sanitize all user-provided data before using it in Liquid templates.**  Treat any external data source as potentially malicious.
        *   **Avoid directly rendering user-provided data in Liquid templates without proper escaping.** Use Liquid's built-in filters for escaping (e.g., `escape`, `cgi_escape`, `xml_escape`).
        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in the generated website** as a defense-in-depth measure, although this doesn't prevent the server-side injection itself.
        *   **Regularly audit templates and data files** for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Jekyll's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but using untrusted or poorly maintained plugins can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jekyll's design encourages the use of plugins to extend its capabilities. It provides a mechanism for executing arbitrary Ruby code during the build process through these plugins.
    *   **Example:** A malicious plugin could contain code that reads sensitive environment variables, modifies the generated output to include malicious scripts, or even compromises the build server by executing arbitrary commands. A vulnerable plugin might have a security flaw that an attacker can exploit if they can influence the plugin's behavior.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise, data theft, and injection of malicious content into the generated website. Vulnerable plugins can be exploited if an attacker can influence their input or execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly vet and audit all Jekyll plugins before use.** Only use plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and a good security track record.
        *   **Review the source code of plugins** before installation to understand their functionality and potential security implications.
        *   **Use dependency scanning tools** to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.
        *   **Keep plugins updated to the latest versions** to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement a process for reviewing plugin updates** before deploying them to production.
        *   **Consider sandboxing or limiting the permissions of plugins** if technically feasible within the Jekyll ecosystem.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Settings Leading to Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_settings_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Certain Jekyll configuration options, if set improperly, can create opportunities for code execution during the build process.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jekyll's configuration allows for customization that, in some cases, can enable the execution of arbitrary code if not carefully managed.
    *   **Example:** While less common in standard Jekyll setups, if a custom configuration or plugin interaction allows for the execution of external commands based on user-controlled data (e.g., through a poorly designed plugin that uses configuration values in `system()` calls), this could lead to command injection.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Improper configuration leading to code execution allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the build server, potentially leading to full compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly understand the security implications of all Jekyll configuration options.**
        *   **Avoid using configuration options that enable the execution of arbitrary code or external commands unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
        *   **Regularly review the Jekyll configuration** for any insecure or unexpected settings.
        *   **Follow the principle of least privilege** when configuring Jekyll and its environment.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Core](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_jekyll_core.md)

*   **Description:** Jekyll relies on various Ruby gems, and vulnerabilities in these core dependencies can be exploited if not kept up-to-date.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jekyll's reliance on external libraries means that vulnerabilities in those libraries become vulnerabilities in Jekyll itself.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a gem used for Markdown processing or YAML parsing could be exploited if an attacker can provide crafted input that triggers the vulnerability during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Vulnerabilities in core dependencies can lead to various security issues, including arbitrary code execution during the build process, denial-of-service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Jekyll and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.** Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   **Use dependency scanning tools (like `bundle audit` for Ruby) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.**
        *   **Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security advisories related to Jekyll's dependencies.**
        *   **Consider using a dependency management tool that provides security vulnerability alerts.**
        *   **Pin dependency versions** to ensure consistent builds and to avoid unexpected issues with new versions, but remember to update these pins regularly after security reviews.
