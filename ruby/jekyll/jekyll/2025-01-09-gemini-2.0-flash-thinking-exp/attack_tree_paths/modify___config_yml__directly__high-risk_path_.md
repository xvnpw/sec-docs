## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify `_config.yml` Directly (HIGH-RISK PATH)

This analysis delves into the attack path "Modify `_config.yml` Directly" within a Jekyll application, focusing on the technical details, potential impact, and mitigation strategies.

**1. Technical Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

* **Target:** The `_config.yml` file located at the root of the Jekyll project directory. This file is the central configuration hub for the Jekyll site, controlling various aspects of its generation and behavior.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker directly alters the content of the `_config.yml` file. This requires write access to the file system where the Jekyll project resides.
* **Simplicity:** This attack path is conceptually simple but highly effective. It bypasses any application-level logic or authentication mechanisms, directly manipulating the core configuration.
* **Persistence:** Modifications to `_config.yml` are persistent. Once the file is altered, the changes will be reflected in subsequent Jekyll builds until the file is corrected.

**2. Preconditions for Successful Exploitation:**

For an attacker to successfully modify `_config.yml` directly, they need to have achieved one or more of the following:

* **Compromised Server/Hosting Environment:** This is the most common scenario. If the server hosting the Jekyll project is compromised (e.g., through vulnerable software, weak SSH credentials, misconfigurations), the attacker gains access to the file system.
* **Compromised Development Environment:** If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine where the Jekyll project is being developed, they can modify the file locally and potentially push the changes to a shared repository.
* **Stolen or Compromised Deployment Credentials:** If the deployment process involves transferring the Jekyll project to a server using compromised credentials (e.g., FTP, SCP, Git credentials), the attacker can inject the modified `_config.yml` during deployment.
* **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the server or development environment could intentionally modify the file.
* **Vulnerable Control Panel/Hosting Interface:** If the hosting provider's control panel or interface has vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to manipulate files through that interface.

**3. Potential Impact and Consequences:**

Modifying `_config.yml` directly allows attackers to exert significant control over the Jekyll application, leading to a wide range of severe consequences:

* **Code Injection and Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    * **`plugins:` array manipulation:** Attackers can add malicious plugins to the `plugins:` array. Jekyll will load and execute these plugins during the build process, granting the attacker arbitrary code execution on the server. This is a critical vulnerability.
    * **`sass:` options manipulation:** While less direct, manipulating Sass options could potentially be used to introduce vulnerabilities if custom Sass processors are used.
* **Content Manipulation and Defacement:**
    * **`title`, `description`, `author` modification:**  Simple changes can deface the website, altering its branding and information.
    * **`baseurl` modification:** Redirecting the `baseurl` can send users to a malicious site or create a phishing attack.
    * **`include` and `exclude` manipulation:** Attackers can include malicious files in the build process or exclude legitimate content, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Modifying build scripts:** If custom build scripts are referenced in `_config.yml`, attackers can alter them to exfiltrate data during the build process.
    * **Injecting tracking scripts:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through layout or include files referenced in the configuration, allowing them to steal user data.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Resource-intensive plugin injection:** Injecting plugins that consume excessive resources during the build process can lead to server overload and denial of service.
    * **Configuration errors:** Introducing invalid configurations can prevent the site from building correctly, effectively taking it offline.
* **Privilege Escalation (in some scenarios):**
    * If the Jekyll build process runs with elevated privileges, the attacker-controlled plugins could potentially be used to escalate privileges on the server.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * If the compromised `_config.yml` is committed to a shared repository, it can affect other developers and deployments, propagating the attack.

**4. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**

Preventing direct modification of `_config.yml` requires a multi-layered security approach:

* **Strong Access Controls:**
    * **File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions on the server hosting the Jekyll project. The web server user should only have the necessary permissions to read the project files, not write access to `_config.yml` or other critical configuration files.
    * **SSH Key Management:** Secure SSH access with strong passwords and, ideally, key-based authentication. Regularly rotate SSH keys.
    * **Control Panel Security:** Ensure the hosting provider's control panel is secure and uses strong authentication.
* **Secure Deployment Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Deployment processes should run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid deploying with root or overly permissive accounts.
    * **Secure Transfer Protocols:** Use secure protocols like SSH (SCP/SFTP) or Git over HTTPS for transferring files. Avoid insecure protocols like FTP.
    * **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** Implement automated deployment pipelines that minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of human error.
    * **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage and deploy configurations consistently and securely.
* **Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:**
    * Regularly scan the server and application for vulnerabilities.
    * Conduct security audits of the deployment process and access controls.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * Keep Jekyll and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Regularly review and audit the plugins used in the project.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * Implement file integrity monitoring (e.g., using `inotify` or similar tools) to detect unauthorized changes to `_config.yml`.
    * Set up alerts for suspicious activity on the server.
* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
    * **Input Validation:** While `_config.yml` isn't directly user-facing, ensure any scripts or plugins that process its content handle input securely.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Developers:**
    * Developers should only have the necessary access to the development environment and repositories.
    * Implement proper access control for code repositories.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with insecure configurations and access controls.

**5. Specific Considerations for Jekyll:**

* **Static Site Generation:** While Jekyll generates static sites, the build process itself can be vulnerable if `_config.yml` is compromised.
* **Plugin System:** The powerful plugin system is a significant attack vector if an attacker can inject malicious plugins through `_config.yml`.
* **Lack of Built-in Access Control:** Jekyll itself doesn't have built-in mechanisms to protect `_config.yml`. Security relies on the underlying operating system and deployment infrastructure.

**6. Conclusion:**

The "Modify `_config.yml` Directly" attack path, while seemingly simple, poses a significant risk to Jekyll applications. Gaining write access to this file grants attackers extensive control over the site's behavior, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, and denial of service. A robust security strategy encompassing strong access controls, secure deployment practices, regular monitoring, and developer awareness is crucial to mitigate this high-risk attack vector. The development team should prioritize securing the server environment and deployment processes to prevent unauthorized modification of critical configuration files like `_config.yml`.
