## Deep Dive Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) during Build Time in Jekyll

This document provides a deep analysis of the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) threat during the build time of a Jekyll application, as described in the provided threat model.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Elaboration:**

* **Mechanism of Attack:** The core of this threat lies in the ability of an attacker to inject malicious Liquid code into data sources that Jekyll processes during its site generation phase. These data sources can include:
    * **Data Files (`_data` directory):** YAML or JSON files containing data used in templates.
    * **Front Matter:** YAML block at the beginning of Markdown or HTML files.
    * **Configuration Files (`_config.yml`):** While typically controlled by the developer, compromised development environments could lead to malicious modifications here.
    * **External Data Sources:** Data fetched via plugins or custom Ruby code during the build process (e.g., fetching data from APIs).
    * **Content of Markdown/HTML files:** While less direct, an attacker with write access could embed Liquid tags within the content itself.
* **Execution Context:**  Crucially, the injected Liquid code is executed on the **build server** during the `jekyll build` command. This means the attacker gains code execution with the privileges of the user running the build process.
* **Impact Scenarios (Beyond the Description):**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Access and steal sensitive information present on the build server, such as environment variables, API keys, database credentials, or other project files not intended for public deployment.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** Modify the generated website to include malicious scripts (e.g., for phishing, malware distribution, or cryptojacking) that will be served to website visitors. This is a particularly dangerous outcome.
    * **Build Process Manipulation:** Disrupt the build process itself, preventing successful website generation or leading to inconsistent deployments.
    * **Lateral Movement:** If the build server is part of a larger network, the attacker could potentially use the compromised build server as a stepping stone to access other internal systems.
    * **Persistence:**  Modify build scripts or configuration files to ensure the malicious code is executed on subsequent builds, even after the initial vulnerability is seemingly addressed.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis of `jekyll-liquid`:**

* **Liquid's Power and Risk:** The power and flexibility of Liquid, which allows for dynamic content generation, are also its weakness in this context. Certain Liquid tags and filters, when combined with malicious input, can be exploited for code execution.
* **Key Attack Vectors within Liquid:**
    * **`capture` Tag:** While seemingly benign, if the captured content contains further Liquid code, it can be executed.
    * **`include` and `render` Tags:**  If the path to the included/rendered file is dynamically constructed using attacker-controlled data, it could lead to including arbitrary files containing malicious Liquid.
    * **Custom Filters and Tags:** If the Jekyll site uses custom Liquid filters or tags (written in Ruby), vulnerabilities in these custom components could be exploited.
    * **Object Access:**  Depending on the available objects and their methods within the Liquid context, attackers might be able to access sensitive system functions or execute arbitrary code.
* **Build-Time Specific Considerations:**  Unlike runtime SSTI, where user input is directly processed during a web request, build-time SSTI relies on injecting malicious code into data sources that are processed offline. This makes detection and mitigation slightly different.

**3. Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Challenge:**  Defining what constitutes "malicious" Liquid code can be complex. Simple string filtering might be insufficient as attackers can use various encoding and obfuscation techniques.
    * **Implementation:**  Implement robust input validation on all data sources. This includes checking data types, formats, and potentially using regular expressions to identify suspicious patterns.
    * **Limitations:**  Perfect sanitization is difficult to achieve. New attack vectors and bypasses can emerge.
* **Avoiding Direct Embedding of User Input:**
    * **Best Practice:**  Avoid directly placing user-provided data within Liquid tags like `{{ user_input }}` or filters. Instead, process the data in Ruby code (e.g., within a Jekyll plugin) and then pass the sanitized result to the template.
    * **Example:** Instead of `<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>` where `page.title` might come from user input, consider pre-processing `page.title` in a plugin.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Limited Effectiveness:** CSP is primarily a client-side security mechanism that instructs the browser on which sources are allowed for loading resources.
    * **Indirect Benefit:** While it won't prevent SSTI during build time, a well-defined CSP can help mitigate the impact of a successful attack by limiting the actions of any malicious scripts injected into the generated website. It can also serve as an indicator of compromise if unexpected content is present.
* **Regularly Updating Jekyll and Dependencies:**
    * **Importance:**  Staying up-to-date ensures that known vulnerabilities in Jekyll and the Liquid engine are patched.
    * **Challenge:**  Requires consistent monitoring of security advisories and timely updates. Dependencies also need to be kept up-to-date.
* **"Safe Mode" or Sandboxed Build Environment:**
    * **Highly Recommended:**  This is a crucial mitigation. Isolating the build process limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict.
    * **Implementation Options:**
        * **Containerization (Docker):** Running the build process within a Docker container provides isolation from the host system.
        * **Virtual Machines:**  Using a dedicated VM for builds offers a higher level of isolation.
        * **Sandboxing Tools:**  Utilizing operating system-level sandboxing mechanisms (if available).
    * **Benefits:** Limits access to sensitive resources, restricts network access, and contains the impact of any successful exploitation.

**4. Additional Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the build process runs with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid running builds as root or with overly permissive accounts.
* **Input Validation on External Data Sources:** If fetching data from external sources, treat this data as potentially untrusted and apply strict validation before using it in Liquid templates.
* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review Jekyll configurations, data files, and custom plugins for potential injection points.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the codebase for potential SSTI vulnerabilities. While these tools might have limitations with dynamic languages like Ruby, they can still identify potential risks.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring for unusual activity on the build server, such as unexpected file modifications or network connections.
* **Secure Development Practices:** Educate developers on the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices for template engines.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure for the build environment, where changes are made by replacing components rather than modifying them in place. This can help prevent persistent compromises.

**5. Proof of Concept (Conceptual):**

Imagine a scenario where the website pulls a list of contributors from a YAML file in the `_data` directory.

**`_data/contributors.yml` (Potentially Malicious):**

```yaml
contributors:
  - name: "John Doe"
    bio: "A friendly developer."
  - name: "{{ 'open' | system: 'cat /etc/passwd' }}"
    bio: "A sneaky attacker."
```

During the build process, if the template iterates through `site.data.contributors` and directly renders the `name` field:

```liquid
{% for contributor in site.data.contributors %}
  <h2>{{ contributor.name }}</h2>
  <p>{{ contributor.bio }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

The Liquid engine would process `{{ 'open' | system: 'cat /etc/passwd' }}` on the build server, potentially executing the `cat /etc/passwd` command and outputting the contents of the password file into the generated HTML (or potentially elsewhere, depending on the exact context and Liquid configuration).

**6. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Sandboxing/Containerization:** Implement a sandboxed or containerized build environment as the primary defense against build-time SSTI.
* **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Develop and enforce strict input validation rules for all data sources used in Liquid templates.
* **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices for Jekyll and Liquid.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Establish a process for regularly updating Jekyll, its dependencies, and any custom plugins.
* **Conduct Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews, specifically focusing on potential template injection vulnerabilities.
* **Consider SAST Tools:** Explore the use of SAST tools to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
* **Adopt the Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the build process runs with minimal necessary permissions.

**7. Conclusion:**

Server-Side Template Injection during build time in Jekyll is a critical threat that can have severe consequences, ranging from data breaches to supply chain attacks. By understanding the attack vectors, the capabilities of the Liquid engine, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. A layered security approach, combining secure coding practices, input validation, regular updates, and a sandboxed build environment, is essential for protecting the build process and the integrity of the generated website.
