## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Jekyll Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_jekyll_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved significant unauthorized control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other significant harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Liquid Templating Engine Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_liquid_templating_engine_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine to process content. If this engine has weaknesses, attackers can inject malicious code that is executed on the server during the build process. This can lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), allowing for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Liquid Code (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_liquid_code__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers attempt to inject malicious Liquid tags or filters into content files (Markdown, HTML) or data files (YAML, JSON, CSV). If Jekyll's Liquid processing doesn't properly sanitize or escape this input, it can be interpreted and executed as code on the server. This path is high-risk because exploiting template injection vulnerabilities can be relatively straightforward and the impact can be severe (arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Jekyll Plugin Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_jekyll_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Jekyll's plugin system allows for extending its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code. Plugins run with the privileges of the Jekyll process, making this a critical area of concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Plugin Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves targeting publicly known security flaws in commonly used Jekyll plugins. If an application uses outdated or vulnerable plugins, attackers can leverage existing exploits to compromise the application. This path is high-risk due to the potential for readily available exploits and the significant impact of plugin compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Jekyll Configuration (`_config.yml`) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_jekyll_configuration____config_yml____critical_node_.md)

The `_config.yml` file controls various aspects of Jekyll's build process. If an attacker can modify this file, they can influence Jekyll's behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution through build hooks or the inclusion of malicious files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration Directives](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_directives.md)

This involves inserting harmful directives into the `_config.yml` file. This can be done to execute arbitrary commands during the build process or to include malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify `_config.yml` Directly (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify___config_yml__directly__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the most direct way to manipulate the configuration. If an attacker gains access to the file system where the Jekyll project resides, they can directly modify the `_config.yml` file. This path is high-risk because direct access to configuration files often grants significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll's Development Server (If Used in Production - Highly Discouraged) (CRITICAL NODE - ANTI-PATTERN)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jekyll's_development_server__if_used_in_production_-_highly_discouraged___adf05626.md)

Jekyll's built-in development server is **not intended for production use** and often contains security vulnerabilities. Using it in a production environment is a critical security mistake that significantly increases the attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Access and Exploitation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_access_and_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

If the development server is mistakenly used in production and is accessible to attackers, they can directly interact with it and exploit its known vulnerabilities. This path is high-risk due to the ease of access if the server is exposed and the potential for full server compromise.
