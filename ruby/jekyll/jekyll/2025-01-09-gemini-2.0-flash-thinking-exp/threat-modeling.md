# Threat Model Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) during build time](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__during_build_time.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Liquid code into data sources (e.g., data files, front matter, external data fetched during build) that are then processed by the Liquid templating engine. This injected code is executed on the build server during site generation.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, allowing the attacker to modify generated files, access sensitive data on the server, or potentially compromise the entire build environment. This could lead to the deployment of a completely compromised website.
    *   **Affected Component:** `jekyll-liquid` (the Liquid templating engine integrated into Jekyll)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided or external data before using it in Liquid templates.
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input within Liquid tags and filters.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) directives in your templates, even though it's primarily a client-side protection, it can help identify unexpected content.
        *   Regularly update Jekyll and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in the Liquid engine.
        *   Consider using a "safe mode" or sandboxed environment for the build process.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could introduce a Jekyll plugin containing malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities in existing plugins. This code is executed during the Jekyll build process. The attacker might convince a developer to install a malicious plugin or exploit a known vulnerability in a popular plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, similar to SSTI. This could lead to the modification of generated files, data exfiltration from the build server, or the injection of malicious content into the final website.
    *   **Affected Component:** `jekyll-plugin-manager` (the system for loading and executing plugins), individual plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all third-party Jekyll plugins before installation. Check their source code, community reputation, and maintainer activity.
        *   Prefer well-maintained and reputable plugins with a history of security awareness.
        *   Regularly update all installed plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving plugin additions within the development team.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.
