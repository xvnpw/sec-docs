**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Jekyll Application:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access to the application and its resources.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Core:**
    * This involves targeting inherent weaknesses within the Jekyll software itself. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like Remote Code Execution or the ability to read sensitive files.

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) during build process:**
    * This is a critical point where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server during the site generation. This grants them significant control over the system.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Plugins:**
    * Jekyll's plugin system, while extending functionality, introduces a significant attack surface. Vulnerabilities in plugins, whether known or custom-developed, can be exploited to compromise the application.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment:**
    * Gaining control over the environment where the Jekyll site is built (developer machines, CI/CD pipelines) allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into the application's source or configuration before it's even deployed.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Core -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) during build process -> Inject malicious Liquid code:**
    * Attackers can inject malicious code into files processed by Jekyll's Liquid templating engine. If user-controlled data is not properly sanitized before being used in Liquid templates, attackers can inject code that executes arbitrary commands on the server during the build process.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Plugins -> Utilize a vulnerable Jekyll plugin -> Exploit known vulnerabilities in popular plugins:**
    * Many Jekyll applications use publicly available plugins. Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in these popular plugins, especially if the application doesn't keep its dependencies updated. Publicly available exploits can make this path relatively easy for attackers with moderate skills.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Plugins -> Utilize a vulnerable Jekyll plugin -> Exploit vulnerabilities in custom-developed plugins -> Remote Code Execution in plugin logic:**
    * Custom-developed plugins, if not written with security in mind, can contain vulnerabilities. Attackers who can analyze the plugin code might find ways to execute arbitrary code through flaws in the plugin's logic.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jekyll Themes -> Utilize a vulnerable Jekyll theme -> Exploit vulnerabilities in custom-developed themes -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in theme templates:**
    * Custom themes often involve rendering user-provided data. If this data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the theme's templates, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users visiting the site.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Gain access to the environment where Jekyll builds the site -> Compromise the development machine:**
    * If a developer's machine is compromised (e.g., through malware or phishing), attackers gain access to the application's source code, configuration, and potentially the credentials used to deploy the site. This allows them to inject malicious code or make other harmful changes.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Gain access to the environment where Jekyll builds the site -> Compromise the CI/CD pipeline:**
    * CI/CD pipelines automate the build and deployment process. If the CI/CD system is compromised (e.g., through leaked credentials or vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software), attackers can inject malicious code into the build process, affecting all subsequent deployments.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Inject malicious code into the build process -> Modify Jekyll configuration files (`_config.yml`):**
    * By gaining write access to the `_config.yml` file, attackers can modify Jekyll's settings to execute arbitrary commands during the build process, include malicious files, or alter the site's behavior.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Inject malicious code into the build process -> Add malicious data files (`_data`):**
    * Attackers can add malicious data files to the `_data` directory. These files can then be accessed and processed by Jekyll, potentially leading to code execution or the injection of malicious content into the generated website.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Inject malicious code into the build process -> Add malicious plugins or themes:**
    * Attackers can directly add malicious plugins or themes to the application's codebase. These malicious components will then be executed during the Jekyll build process, allowing for a wide range of attacks.

* **Compromise the Jekyll Build Environment -> Inject malicious code into the build process -> Modify existing source files with malicious content:**
    * By gaining write access to the application's source files (Markdown, HTML, etc.), attackers can directly inject malicious scripts or content into the website. This is a direct and effective way to compromise the application.
