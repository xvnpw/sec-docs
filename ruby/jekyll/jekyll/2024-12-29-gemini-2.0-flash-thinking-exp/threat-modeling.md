Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Jekyll:

*   **Threat:** Liquid Template Injection (Server-Side)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid code into user-controlled data that is then processed by Jekyll's Liquid rendering engine. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities where user input is incorporated into templates without proper sanitization. The attacker can execute arbitrary Ruby code on the server during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jekyll build environment, potentially leading to the injection of malicious content into the generated website, data exfiltration from the server, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Liquid rendering engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided data directly within Liquid templates.
        *   If user data must be used, implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially malicious Liquid syntax.
        *   Consider using a templating engine with better security features if dynamic content is a core requirement.
        *   Regularly audit templates for potential injection points.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious Jekyll plugin into the project. This can happen through social engineering, supply chain attacks (compromising plugin repositories), or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin installation process. The malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code during the Jekyll build process.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to Liquid Template Injection, this can lead to complete compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious content, data exfiltration, or denial of service. The impact can be even more severe as plugins have broader access to the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin system
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all plugins before installation.
        *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing plugin code before integration.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugins.

*   **Threat:** YAML Front Matter Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates data sources that feed into Jekyll's YAML front matter. This could involve compromising external data files or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that generate front matter data. By injecting malicious YAML, the attacker can manipulate site configuration or introduce malicious content processed by Jekyll.
    *   **Impact:**  Manipulation of website content, redirection to malicious sites, or potentially triggering code execution if custom plugins interact with the manipulated front matter in an unsafe way.
    *   **Affected Component:** YAML parsing and front matter processing
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the sources of data used in YAML front matter.
        *   Implement validation and sanitization for any external data integrated into front matter.
        *   Avoid dynamically generating complex front matter based on untrusted input.

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Vulnerabilities (`_config.yml`)
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, is accidentally or intentionally stored in Jekyll's `_config.yml` file and becomes accessible if the repository is compromised or the generated site includes this file.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and processing
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `_config.yml`.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to handle sensitive configuration.
        *   Ensure the `.gitignore` file properly excludes sensitive configuration files from being committed to version control.
        *   Regularly review the `_config.yml` file for potential security issues.
