## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Gem Versions in Jekyll Project's `Gemfile.lock`](./mitigation_strategies/pin_gem_versions_in_jekyll_project's__gemfile_lock_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Commit `Gemfile.lock` for Jekyll project:** Ensure that the `Gemfile.lock` file in your Jekyll project is consistently committed to version control. This file, generated by Bundler, records the exact versions of gems, including Jekyll and its dependencies, used in the project.
*   Step 2: **Avoid manual edits to Jekyll's `Gemfile.lock`:** Do not manually modify the `Gemfile.lock` file in your Jekyll project. Allow Bundler to manage it through commands like `bundle install` and `bundle update`.
*   Step 3: **Use `bundle install --deployment` for Jekyll deployments:** In deployment environments for your Jekyll site, use `bundle install --deployment`. This ensures Bundler uses only the gem versions specified in `Gemfile.lock` for Jekyll and its dependencies, preventing unexpected version changes.
*   Step 4: **Update `Gemfile.lock` through `bundle update` for Jekyll projects:** When intentionally updating Jekyll or its gems, use `bundle update` and commit the resulting changes to `Gemfile.lock` to maintain version consistency.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Inconsistent Jekyll Environments - Severity: Medium
    *   Without `Gemfile.lock`, different environments (development, staging, production) might use different versions of Jekyll and its gems, leading to inconsistent site generation and potential environment-specific issues or vulnerabilities.
*   Jekyll Dependency Conflicts - Severity: Low
    *   Reduces the risk of dependency conflicts arising from different gem versions in different Jekyll environments.

**Impact:**
