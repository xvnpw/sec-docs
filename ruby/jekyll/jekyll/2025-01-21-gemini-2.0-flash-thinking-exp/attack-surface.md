# Attack Surface Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Attack Surface: [Liquid Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/liquid_template_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious Liquid code into templates, leading to arbitrary code execution during the build process.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine to process templates. If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Liquid without sanitization, it becomes executable code during site generation.

**Example:** A plugin that allows users to submit custom HTML snippets for their profile. If this snippet is directly rendered using Liquid without escaping, a user could inject `{{ system 'rm -rf /' }}` (a dangerous command, for illustration).

**Impact:** Critical. Full control of the build server, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never directly embed user-provided data into Liquid templates.**
*   **Use Liquid's built-in filters for escaping and sanitization (e.g., `escape`, `cgi_escape`).**
*   **Carefully review and sanitize any data before passing it to Liquid.**
*   **Consider using a sandboxed environment for the build process.**

## Attack Surface: [YAML Front Matter Injection](./attack_surfaces/yaml_front_matter_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious YAML code into the front matter of Markdown or HTML files, potentially manipulating Jekyll's configuration or injecting data processed during the build.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll parses YAML front matter to configure pages and posts. If external data influences this front matter without proper validation, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A system that programmatically generates Jekyll content based on user input. If a user can control a field that is directly inserted into the YAML front matter, they might inject `---
 title: "My Title"
 layout: default
 permalink: "{{ site.baseurl }}/malicious"
---
`.

**Impact:** High. Potential for redirecting users to malicious sites, manipulating site structure, or injecting malicious content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid incorporating user-provided data directly into YAML front matter.**
*   **If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize any data before including it in the front matter.**
*   **Use parameterized approaches or templating systems that handle escaping for YAML.**

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Inclusion via Includes/Layouts](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_inclusion_via_includeslayouts.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the paths used in `include` or `layout` directives to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll's `include` and `layout` tags allow for modularity. If the paths used with these tags are dynamically generated based on user input without validation, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A plugin that allows users to select a "theme" where the theme path is directly used in an `include` tag: `{% include {{ page.theme }}/header.html %}`. A malicious user could set `page.theme` to `../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive server files, potential for code execution if included files are processed as templates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never directly use user-provided data to construct file paths for `include` or `layout`.**
*   **Use a whitelist of allowed include/layout paths.**
*   **Ensure proper input validation and sanitization if dynamic paths are absolutely necessary.**

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

**Description:** Using third-party Jekyll plugins that contain malicious code or have security vulnerabilities.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll's plugin architecture allows for extending functionality. However, the security of these plugins is the responsibility of their developers, introducing a supply chain risk directly within the Jekyll ecosystem.

**Example:** Installing a popular but outdated plugin with a known remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution during the build process, data breaches, compromise of the generated site.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins before using them.**
*   **Check plugin source code for suspicious activity.**
*   **Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.**
*   **Monitor plugin repositories and security advisories for reported issues.**
*   **Consider using only well-maintained and reputable plugins.**

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Custom Scripts/Hooks](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_custom_scriptshooks.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into custom scripts or hooks executed during the Jekyll build process.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll allows developers to define custom scripts and hooks that run during different stages of the build. If user-controlled data is used in these scripts without sanitization, it can lead to command injection.

**Example:** A build script that processes user-uploaded images and uses a command-line tool where the filename is directly taken from user input: `image_processor {{ page.image_filename }}`. A malicious filename like `; rm -rf /` could be injected.

**Impact:** Critical. Full control of the build server, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using user-provided data directly in shell commands within build scripts.**
*   **Use parameterized commands or secure libraries that prevent command injection.**
*   **Sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in scripts.**
*   **Run build processes with the least necessary privileges.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into user-generated content that is then rendered on the Jekyll site without proper sanitization.

**How Jekyll Contributes:** While Jekyll generates static sites, if user-generated content (e.g., comments, blog posts fetched from an external source) is not properly escaped during the build process *by Jekyll*, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities in the final output.

**Example:** A blog post fetched from an API contains a comment with malicious JavaScript: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If this comment is directly included in the generated HTML *by Jekyll* without escaping, it will execute in users' browsers.

**Impact:** High. Stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always sanitize and escape user-generated content before including it in the generated site.**
*   **Use Jekyll's built-in Liquid filters for HTML escaping (e.g., `escape`).**
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.**
