### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Build/Deployment Pipeline

**CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Build/Deployment Pipeline**

This node represents a highly critical vulnerability because successful compromise grants attackers significant control over the final deployed application. The build/deployment pipeline acts as a central point of trust, and if this trust is broken, the consequences can be severe and widespread.

**Sub-Attack 1: Inject Malicious Code During Build**

* **Detailed Breakdown:**
    * **Target:** The build process itself, occurring after Jekyll has generated the static files but before they are deployed.
    * **Attacker Goals:** Introduce malicious code that will be included in the final deployed website.
    * **Potential Attack Vectors:**
        * **Compromised CI/CD Server:**
            * **Credential Theft:** Attackers gain access to the CI/CD server's credentials (e.g., through phishing, brute-force, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform).
            * **Exploiting CI/CD Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software itself.
            * **Malicious Plugins/Extensions:** Installing malicious plugins or extensions within the CI/CD environment.
        * **Compromised Build Environment:**
            * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Injecting malicious code into dependencies used during the build process (e.g., npm packages, Ruby gems).
            * **Compromised Build Agents:** If using self-hosted build agents, attackers could compromise these machines.
        * **Insecure Build Scripts:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the build scripts themselves (e.g., command injection).
    * **Types of Malicious Code:**
        * **Client-Side Attacks (JavaScript):** Injecting JavaScript code to perform actions in the user's browser, such as:
            * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing user credentials, personal information, or session tokens.

**Sub-Attack 2: Modify Deployment Configuration**

* **Detailed Breakdown:**
    * **Target:** The configuration and scripts responsible for deploying the built Jekyll application to the production environment.
    * **Attacker Goals:** Manipulate the deployment process to achieve malicious objectives.
    * **Potential Attack Vectors:**
        * **Compromised CI/CD Server (as above):** Gaining access to deployment configurations stored on the CI/CD server.
        * **Compromised Deployment Credentials:** Stealing credentials used to access the deployment target (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens for cloud providers).
        * **Insecure Storage of Deployment Secrets:**  Storing deployment credentials in insecure locations (e.g., plain text in configuration files, version control).
        * **Vulnerabilities in Deployment Tools:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the tools used for deployment (e.g., `rsync`, `scp`, cloud provider CLIs).
    * **Types of Modifications:**
        * **Changing the Deployment Target:** Redirecting the deployment to a server controlled by the attacker. This allows them to serve a completely malicious version of the website.
        * **Introducing Malicious Steps in the Deployment Process:** Adding extra steps to the deployment script that execute malicious code on the production server or exfiltrate data.
        * **Deploying Backdoors:** Injecting code that allows for persistent remote access to the production environment.
        * **Data Exfiltration During Deployment:** Modifying the deployment process to copy sensitive data to an attacker-controlled location.
