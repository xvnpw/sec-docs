### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1 Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)

**Description:** This overarching path represents attacks that target the application's build process to inject malicious code or manipulate the final output. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, as the injected code executes with the privileges of the build environment.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the build process can lead to:
* **Backdoored application:**  Malicious code embedded in the final output.
* **Data exfiltration:** Sensitive information accessed and transmitted during the build.
* **Supply chain attacks:**  Compromised builds distributed to users.
* **Denial of service:**  Build process disrupted or rendered unusable.

**Detection:** Monitoring build logs for unusual activity, implementing integrity checks on build artifacts, and regularly reviewing dependencies.

**Mitigation:** Implementing secure build practices, using isolated build environments, and employing dependency management tools with security scanning.

#### 4.2 Malicious Plugin Injection/Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)

**Description:** This critical node focuses on attacks that involve injecting or exploiting malicious plugins within the Jekyll environment. Plugins have significant access during the build process, making them a prime target for attackers.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during the build, leading to any of the impacts listed under "Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities."

**Detection:**  Monitoring changes to dependency files, scanning installed gems for known vulnerabilities, and implementing code review for custom plugins.

**Mitigation:**  Strictly control access to dependency files, regularly update plugins, and implement a process for vetting and auditing plugin usage.

##### 4.2.1 Inject Malicious Plugin

**Description:** Attackers aim to introduce a malicious plugin into the Jekyll project. This can be achieved by directly modifying dependency files or exploiting vulnerabilities in dependency management tools.

**Impact:**  Installation and execution of malicious code during the `bundle install` process.

**Detection:**  Monitoring changes to `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`, using integrity checks on these files, and implementing alerts for unexpected dependency changes.

**Mitigation:**  Implement strong access controls on the repository, utilize multi-factor authentication for repository access, and consider using signed commits.

###### 4.2.1.1 Compromise Gemfile/Gemfile.lock (CRITICAL NODE)

**Description:** This critical node represents the scenario where an attacker gains write access to the repository and modifies the `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` files. By adding a malicious gem dependency, the attacker ensures that their code is installed and executed during the `bundle install` phase of the build process.

**Technical Analysis:**
* **Attacker Action:**  Gains unauthorized access to the repository (e.g., compromised developer credentials, exploited CI/CD pipeline vulnerability).
* **Modification:**  Adds a line to `Gemfile` referencing a malicious gem hosted on a public or private gem server. Alternatively, modifies `Gemfile.lock` to force the installation of a specific malicious version of an existing gem.
* **Execution:** When `bundle install` is executed, Bundler fetches and installs the malicious gem. The gem's `require` statements or install hooks can then execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The malicious gem can execute any code with the privileges of the user running the `bundle install` command (typically the build server or developer machine).
* **Data Theft:**  The malicious code can access environment variables, configuration files, and other sensitive data present during the build process.
* **Backdoor Installation:**  The malicious gem can install persistent backdoors or modify existing files to maintain access.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If the compromised build is deployed, all users of the application are potentially affected.

**Detection:**
* **Version Control Monitoring:**  Track changes to `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` meticulously. Any unexpected modifications should trigger immediate alerts.
* **Code Review:**  Regularly review changes to dependency files, especially before merging pull requests.
* **Dependency Scanning:**  Utilize tools that scan `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities in listed gems.
* **Integrity Checks:**  Implement checksum verification for `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to detect unauthorized modifications.

**Mitigation:**
* **Strong Access Controls:** Implement robust access control mechanisms for the repository, limiting write access to authorized personnel only.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all repository accounts to prevent unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
* **Code Review Process:**  Mandate code reviews for all changes to `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.
* **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin specific versions of gems in `Gemfile.lock` to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management Tools:** Utilize tools like Dependabot or Renovate Bot to automate dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
* **Signed Commits:**  Encourage or enforce the use of signed commits to verify the identity of the committer.
* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**  Harden the CI/CD pipeline to prevent attackers from gaining access and modifying build configurations or dependency files.

##### 4.2.2 Exploit Vulnerable Plugin (HIGH RISK PATH)

**Description:** Attackers identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities in plugins used by the Jekyll application. This often involves targeting outdated plugin versions with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs).

**Technical Analysis:**
* **Vulnerability Identification:** Attackers scan the application's `Gemfile.lock` or analyze the used plugins to identify versions with known vulnerabilities.
* **Exploitation:**  Attackers craft specific inputs or trigger certain conditions during the build process that exploit the identified vulnerability. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the build process.

**Impact:**  Similar to injecting malicious plugins, exploiting vulnerable plugins can lead to arbitrary code execution during the build, resulting in backdoors, data theft, or supply chain compromise.

**Detection:**
* **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan `Gemfile.lock` against vulnerability databases (e.g., using `bundle audit`).
* **Monitoring CVE Databases:** Stay informed about newly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting used plugins.
* **Build Log Analysis:**  Monitor build logs for error messages or unusual activity that might indicate an attempted exploit.

**Mitigation:**
* **Regular Plugin Updates:**  Maintain up-to-date versions of all plugins to patch known vulnerabilities. Automate this process where possible.
* **Vulnerability Scanning Integration:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify and flag vulnerable plugins.
* **Plugin Auditing:**  Periodically review the list of used plugins and remove any unnecessary or outdated ones.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If a plugin has a history of vulnerabilities, consider switching to a more secure alternative.

#### 4.3 Template Injection/Abuse (HIGH RISK PATH)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Jekyll templates (using the Liquid templating language) or data files that are processed by the templates. This allows them to execute code either during the build process or within the generated static HTML.

**Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server during the build or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated website.

**Detection:**  Code review of templates and data files, security scanning tools that can detect template injection vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**  Properly sanitize user-provided data used in templates, avoid using unsafe Liquid tags or filters, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.

##### 4.3.1 Arbitrary Code Execution during Build

**Description:** If the templating engine or custom Liquid tags are not properly secured, attackers can inject code that executes on the server during the build process. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in custom Liquid tags or using insecure features of the Liquid language.

**Technical Analysis:**
* **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject specially crafted Liquid code into data files or template variables that are processed during the build.
* **Exploitation:**  Insecure custom Liquid tags or the use of unsafe Liquid features (if enabled) allow the injected code to be executed by the Jekyll build process.

**Impact:**  Full control over the build environment, allowing for actions such as installing backdoors, stealing secrets, or modifying the build output.

**Detection:**
* **Code Review of Custom Liquid Tags:**  Thoroughly review the implementation of any custom Liquid tags for potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Ensure that any external data used in templates is properly sanitized to prevent the injection of malicious Liquid code.
* **Restricted Liquid Features:**  Disable or restrict the use of potentially dangerous Liquid features if they are not necessary.

**Mitigation:**
* **Secure Custom Liquid Tag Development:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Liquid tags, ensuring proper input validation and output encoding.
* **Disable Unnecessary Liquid Features:**  Disable any Liquid features that are not required for the application's functionality.
* **Sandboxing:**  If possible, run the build process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of successful code execution.

##### 4.3.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Output

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into templates, which is then included in the generated static HTML. This leads to client-side attacks where the injected script executes in the browsers of users visiting the website.

**Technical Analysis:**
* **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers inject JavaScript code into template variables or data files that are rendered into the final HTML output without proper sanitization.
* **Execution in User's Browser:** When a user visits the compromised page, their browser executes the injected JavaScript code.

**Impact:**
* **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing user session cookies.
* **Credential Theft:**  Capturing user login credentials.
* **Defacement:**  Modifying the content of the webpage.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing or malware distribution websites.

**Detection:**
* **Security Scanning:**  Utilize web application security scanners that can detect XSS vulnerabilities in the generated HTML.
* **Manual Code Review:**  Carefully review templates for potential XSS injection points.

**Mitigation:**
* **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-provided data before rendering it in templates. Use Liquid filters like `escape` or `cgi_escape`.
* **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Apply encoding appropriate to the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the application to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.
