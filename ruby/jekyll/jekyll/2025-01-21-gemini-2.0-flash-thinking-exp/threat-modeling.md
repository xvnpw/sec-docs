# Threat Model Analysis for jekyll/jekyll

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Liquid](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_liquid.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Liquid code into user-controlled data that is then processed by the Jekyll rendering engine. This could happen if user input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization. The injected code executes on the server during the build process.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to website defacement, data breaches (if sensitive data is accessible during the build), or the ability to inject malicious content into the generated static files.

**Affected Component:** Liquid rendering engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user-supplied data directly within Liquid templates.
*   Sanitize and escape any user input before incorporating it into Liquid templates.
*   Implement strict input validation for any data used in templates.
*   Regularly audit Liquid templates for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Liquid Tags and Filters](./threats/information_disclosure_through_liquid_tags_and_filters.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft specific input or manipulate the application in a way that causes Liquid tags or filters to reveal sensitive information that should not be publicly accessible. This could involve accessing configuration variables, environment variables, or data file contents *through Jekyll's processing*.

**Impact:** Exposure of API keys, database credentials, internal paths, or other confidential information that could be used for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Liquid rendering engine, potentially accessing configuration and data files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review the usage of Liquid tags and filters, especially those dealing with file system access or data iteration.
*   Avoid displaying sensitive data directly in templates.
*   Implement proper access controls and permissions on data files and configuration files.
*   Sanitize output from Liquid tags and filters to prevent accidental disclosure.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Jekyll Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_jekyll_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in third-party Jekyll plugins or introduce malicious plugins into the project. These plugins can execute arbitrary code *within the Jekyll build process* or manipulate the generated website content *through Jekyll's plugin API*. This could happen if developers install plugins from untrusted sources or fail to keep plugins updated.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, website defacement, injection of malicious scripts into the website, or data theft.

**Affected Component:** Plugin API, individual plugin code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Thoroughly vet the code of any third-party plugin before installation.
*   Keep all installed plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a process for reviewing and auditing plugin code.
*   Consider using a plugin management system that allows for security checks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in `_config.yml`](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in___config_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the `_config.yml` file, which might contain sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or internal paths. This access is relevant to Jekyll because this file directly configures Jekyll's behavior.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access external services or internal systems.

**Affected Component:** `_config.yml` file, configuration loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `_config.yml`.
*   Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to handle sensitive configuration.
*   Ensure proper access controls and permissions are in place for the `_config.yml` file.
*   Exclude `_config.yml` from public Git repositories if it contains sensitive data.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Settings](./threats/insecure_configuration_settings.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit insecurely configured Jekyll settings. For example, if unsafe YAML parsing is enabled or if features that expose internal paths are activated *within Jekyll's configuration*, it could create vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or information disclosure depending on the specific insecure setting.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, specific configuration options.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific setting)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand the security implications of each Jekyll configuration option.
*   Follow security best practices when configuring Jekyll.
*   Regularly review and audit the `_config.yml` file for insecure settings.
