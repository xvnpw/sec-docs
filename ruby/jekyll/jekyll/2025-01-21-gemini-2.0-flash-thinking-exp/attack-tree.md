## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Jekyll (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_jekyll__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent attack vectors aim to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Malicious Plugin Injection/Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Inject Malicious Plugin:**
        * **Compromise Gemfile/Gemfile.lock (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers gain write access to the repository and modify the `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` to include malicious gem dependencies. When `bundle install` is executed, the malicious plugin is installed and its code runs during the Jekyll build process.
    * **Exploit Vulnerable Plugin (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers identify and leverage known security vulnerabilities in plugins used by the Jekyll application. This can involve exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated plugin versions, allowing for arbitrary code execution during the build.
* **Template Injection/Abuse (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers inject malicious code into Jekyll templates (using the Liquid templating language) or data files that are processed by the templates. This can lead to:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution during Build:** If the templating engine or custom Liquid tags are not properly secured, attackers can inject code that executes on the server during the build process.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Output:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into templates, which is then included in the generated static HTML, leading to client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Plugin Injection/Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_plugin_injectionexploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Plugin:**
    * **Compromise Gemfile/Gemfile.lock (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers gain write access to the repository and modify the `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` to include malicious gem dependencies. When `bundle install` is executed, the malicious plugin is installed and its code runs during the Jekyll build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Gemfile/Gemfile.lock (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_gemfilegemfile_lock__critical_node_.md)

Attackers gain write access to the repository and modify the `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` to include malicious gem dependencies. When `bundle install` is executed, the malicious plugin is installed and its code runs during the Jekyll build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Plugin (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_plugin__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers identify and leverage known security vulnerabilities in plugins used by the Jekyll application. This can involve exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated plugin versions, allowing for arbitrary code execution during the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection/Abuse (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/template_injectionabuse__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into Jekyll templates (using the Liquid templating language) or data files that are processed by the templates. This can lead to:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution during Build:** If the templating engine or custom Liquid tags are not properly secured, attackers can inject code that executes on the server during the build process.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Output:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into templates, which is then included in the generated static HTML, leading to client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Exploitation (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_exploitation__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruby or Gems (CRITICAL NODE):** Jekyll relies on the Ruby programming language and various Ruby gems (libraries). Attackers can exploit known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of Ruby or the gems used by the application. This often leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruby or Gems (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ruby_or_gems__critical_node_.md)

Jekyll relies on the Ruby programming language and various Ruby gems (libraries). Attackers can exploit known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of Ruby or the gems used by the application. This often leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Generated Static Content Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_generated_static_content_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Jekyll Output (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the content files (Markdown, HTML) that are processed by Jekyll. Because Jekyll generates static content, these scripts are directly included in the final HTML and executed in the user's browser when they visit the page. This can happen due to:
    * **Direct Injection into Content Files:** Attackers gain write access to content files and embed malicious JavaScript.
    * **Lack of Output Escaping in Custom Tags/Filters:** If custom Liquid tags or filters do not properly sanitize user-provided data before including it in the output, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Jekyll Output (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_jekyll_output__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious scripts into the content files (Markdown, HTML) that are processed by Jekyll. Because Jekyll generates static content, these scripts are directly included in the final HTML and executed in the user's browser when they visit the page. This can happen due to:
    * **Direct Injection into Content Files:** Attackers gain write access to content files and embed malicious JavaScript.
    * **Lack of Output Escaping in Custom Tags/Filters:** If custom Liquid tags or filters do not properly sanitize user-provided data before including it in the output, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Development/Deployment Workflow Weaknesses Related to Jekyll (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developmentdeployment_workflow_weaknesses_related_to_jekyll__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Compromise Development Environment (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers target the machines of developers working on the Jekyll application. If successful, they can:
    * **Inject Malicious Code During Development:** Modify source code, templates, or configuration files before they are processed by Jekyll or committed to the repository.
* **Compromise Version Control System (VCS) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) where the Jekyll project is stored. This allows them to:
    * **Inject Malicious Code Directly into the Repository:** Modify any file in the repository, including content, templates, plugins, and configuration, introducing vulnerabilities that will be built into the application.
* **Compromise Build/Deployment Pipeline (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers target the automated processes used to build and deploy the Jekyll application. This can involve compromising the CI/CD server or the deployment scripts. If successful, they can:
    * **Inject Malicious Code During Build:** Modify the generated static files after Jekyll has processed them but before they are deployed to the production environment.
    * **Modify Deployment Configuration:** Change the deployment target or introduce malicious steps in the deployment process, potentially deploying the application to a compromised server or injecting further malicious components.
