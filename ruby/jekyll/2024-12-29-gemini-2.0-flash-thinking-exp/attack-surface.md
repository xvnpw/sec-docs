*   **Liquid Template Injection**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious Liquid template code into content or data processed by Jekyll, leading to arbitrary code execution during the build process.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine to process dynamic content. If user-provided or external data is directly incorporated into Liquid templates without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user comment form allows arbitrary input that is then displayed on a page using a Liquid tag like `{{ comment.content }}`. An attacker submits a comment containing `{% raw %}{% assign x = 'system' %}{% capture output %}{{ x } 'whoami' %}{% endcapture %}{{ output }}{% endraw %}`. During the build, this could execute the `whoami` command on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and malicious modifications to the generated website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user-controlled data before using it in Liquid templates.
        *   Use output filters provided by Liquid where appropriate (e.g., `escape`).
        *   Avoid directly incorporating unsanitized external data sources into Liquid templates.
        *   Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data.

*   **Markdown Processing Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Markdown processor used by Jekyll (e.g., Kramdown, CommonMark) allow attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into Markdown content, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks on website visitors.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll relies on a Markdown processor to convert Markdown files into HTML. If the processor has vulnerabilities, it can be exploited through crafted Markdown input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a blog post containing a specially crafted Markdown link like `[Click me](javascript:alert('XSS'))`. When Jekyll processes this, it generates HTML that executes the malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement of the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Markdown processor gem updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Configure the Markdown processor with strict settings to limit potentially dangerous HTML tags.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.
        *   Sanitize user-provided Markdown content on the client-side before submission or on the server-side before processing with Jekyll.

*   **Vulnerable or Malicious Jekyll Plugins**
    *   **Description:**  Using third-party Jekyll plugins that contain security vulnerabilities or are intentionally malicious can introduce various attack vectors.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll's plugin architecture allows extending its functionality. However, the security of these plugins is the responsibility of their developers.
    *   **Example:** A plugin designed to handle user authentication has a vulnerability that allows bypassing the authentication mechanism. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, a malicious plugin could be designed to steal sensitive data during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability, this can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or website compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins before installation.
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and a good security track record.
        *   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider auditing the source code of plugins for potential security flaws.
        *   Implement a "least privilege" approach for plugin permissions if possible.

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in RubyGems**
    *   **Description:**  Jekyll relies on various RubyGems. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not kept up-to-date.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll's functionality depends on its RubyGems dependencies. Security flaws in these dependencies directly impact the security of the Jekyll application.
    *   **Example:** A dependency used for image processing has a known vulnerability that allows remote code execution. If an attacker can upload a specially crafted image, this vulnerability could be exploited during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to remote code execution on the build server, potentially compromising the generated website and sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update RubyGems and dependencies using `bundle update` or similar tools.
        *   Use a dependency management tool like Bundler to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Utilize security scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Pin dependency versions in the `Gemfile` to ensure consistent and secure builds, while still regularly reviewing for updates.

*   **Command Injection via Build Hooks**
    *   **Description:** If user-controlled data is used within custom build hooks without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities on the build server.
    *   **How Jekyll Contributes:** Jekyll allows defining custom scripts to run during the build process. If these scripts process untrusted data, they become a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A build hook script takes a filename from user input and uses it in a command like `convert {{ filename }} output.png`. An attacker could provide a malicious filename like `; rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Can lead to complete control of the build server, allowing attackers to modify the generated website or access sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled data directly in build hook commands.
        *   If necessary, sanitize and validate user input rigorously before using it in commands.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution where possible.
        *   Run build processes in isolated environments with limited privileges.
