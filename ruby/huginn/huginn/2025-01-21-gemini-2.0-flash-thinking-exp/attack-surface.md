# Attack Surface Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Attack Surface: [Agent Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/agent_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** The ability to execute arbitrary code within Huginn agents, typically Ruby code.
    * **How Huginn Contributes:** Huginn's core functionality relies on users defining and executing Ruby code within agent configurations to process and transform data. This inherent flexibility introduces the risk of malicious code injection.
    * **Example:** A malicious user creates an agent with Ruby code that executes system commands like `system("rm -rf /")` or accesses sensitive files on the server.
    * **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data loss, denial of service, exfiltration of sensitive information.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust sandboxing for agent code execution using restricted Ruby environments (e.g., `SafeVM`). Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for agent configurations. Consider alternative, safer scripting languages or DSLs for agent logic. Implement resource limits for agent execution to prevent resource exhaustion.
        * **Users:** Only install agents from trusted sources. Carefully review the code of any custom agents before deploying them. Avoid using agents that require elevated privileges or access to sensitive system resources.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of External Service Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_external_service_credentials.md)

* **Description:**  The risk of exposing API keys, OAuth tokens, or other credentials used by Huginn agents to interact with external services.
    * **How Huginn Contributes:** Agents frequently need credentials to access external APIs. Huginn's storage and management of these credentials can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled securely.
    * **Example:** API keys are stored in plain text in the Huginn database or configuration files. An attacker gaining access to the database can retrieve these keys and abuse the associated external services.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches on external platforms, financial losses due to abuse of paid services, reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement secure credential storage mechanisms (e.g., using encryption at rest and in transit, secrets management tools). Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files. Provide mechanisms for users to securely manage and rotate credentials.
        * **Users:** Utilize Huginn's built-in features for secure credential management. Regularly rotate API keys and OAuth tokens. Grant agents the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks. Be cautious about sharing Huginn instances or databases with untrusted parties.
