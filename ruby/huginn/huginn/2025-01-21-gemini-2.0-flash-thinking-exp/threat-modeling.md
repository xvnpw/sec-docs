# Threat Model Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Threat: [Malicious Agent Creation/Modification](./threats/malicious_agent_creationmodification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Huginn instance (e.g., through compromised credentials or an unpatched vulnerability) and creates new agents or modifies existing ones to perform malicious actions. This could involve agents designed to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by Huginn, launch attacks against other systems, or disrupt Huginn's functionality.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external systems, denial of service, manipulation of application workflows.

**Affected Component:** Huginn's Web UI (agent creation/editing forms, API endpoints), Agent execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Huginn access, including multi-factor authentication.
*   Regularly review and audit user permissions within Huginn.
*   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization on agent configuration parameters.
*   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit who can create or modify agents.
*   Monitor agent creation and modification activities for suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Exploiting Agent Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_agent_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Agents often rely on external libraries or gems. An attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. This could be achieved by crafting specific inputs that trigger the vulnerability during agent execution, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Huginn server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the Huginn instance, data breach.

**Affected Component:** Agent execution environment, specific agent types utilizing vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Huginn and its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in agent dependencies.
*   Consider using containerization to isolate agent execution environments.
*   Restrict the use of external libraries within agents to only necessary and trusted ones.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Agents](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_agents.md)

**Description:** An attacker creates or modifies agents to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This could be done by creating agents that perform computationally intensive tasks, generate excessive network traffic, or create an overwhelming number of events. This can lead to a denial of service for the Huginn instance and potentially impact other applications on the same server.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, instability of the Huginn instance and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Agent execution engine, scheduler.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement resource limits and quotas for agent execution.
*   Monitor resource usage of individual agents and the overall Huginn instance.
*   Implement mechanisms to detect and terminate agents consuming excessive resources.
*   Review agent logic for potential resource-intensive operations.

## Threat: [Exploiting Insecure Agent Code Execution](./threats/exploiting_insecure_agent_code_execution.md)

**Description:** Huginn allows agents to execute code (e.g., Ruby code in the "ShellCommandAgent"). If an attacker can inject malicious code into an agent's configuration (perhaps through a stored XSS vulnerability in the UI or by compromising an administrator account), this code will be executed on the Huginn server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the Huginn instance and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Agent execution engine, specific agent types allowing code execution (e.g., ShellCommandAgent, JavascriptAgent).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the use of agents that allow arbitrary code execution if possible.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any code snippets within agent configurations.
*   Consider sandboxing or containerizing agent execution environments to limit the impact of malicious code.
*   Regularly audit agent configurations for suspicious code.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Huginn UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_huginn_ui.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Huginn's web interface allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could be achieved by injecting scripts into agent names, descriptions, or other user-controlled input fields that are not properly sanitized. When other users view these pages, the malicious scripts are executed in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, defacement of the Huginn interface.

**Affected Component:** Huginn's Web UI (views, templates, controllers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper output encoding and escaping in Huginn's web interface to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
*   Regularly scan Huginn's codebase for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** Huginn stores configuration data, including potentially sensitive information like API keys and credentials for external services. If this data is not properly encrypted at rest, an attacker who gains access to the Huginn server's file system or database could potentially retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to external services, data breaches in connected systems.

**Affected Component:** Huginn's database, configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database and configuration files.
*   Use secure methods for managing and storing API keys and credentials (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions).
*   Limit access to the Huginn server's file system and database.
