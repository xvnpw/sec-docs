* Implement strong authentication and authorization for Huginn access.
* Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.
* Monitor agent creation and modification activities.
* Implement input validation and sanitization in agent code (if custom agents are developed).
* Keep Huginn and its dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Agent Modification for Malicious Purposes](./threats/agent_modification_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access modifies an existing, legitimate agent to perform malicious actions. This could involve changing the agent's logic, data destinations, or triggers to redirect its behavior towards harmful goals.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized actions, disruption of legitimate processes, subtle and long-term attacks.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Agents Module, Web UI, Agent Execution Engine, Scenario Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for Huginn access.
* Use version control for agent configurations and scenarios.
* Implement code review processes for agent modifications.
* Monitor agent modification activities and alert on suspicious changes.
* Consider using immutable agent configurations where feasible.

## Threat: [Agent Code Injection/Exploitation](./threats/agent_code_injectionexploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Huginn's agent execution environment or within specific agent types to inject and execute arbitrary code. This could be through insecure deserialization, command injection flaws, or other code execution vulnerabilities within Huginn itself.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, privilege escalation, denial of service, complete control over the Huginn instance and potentially the underlying server.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Agent Execution Engine, Specific Agent Types (e.g., Web Request Agent, Javascript Agent), Core Huginn Libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Huginn and all dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization in all agent code, especially for user-provided input.
* Enforce least privilege principles for agent execution environments.
* Consider using sandboxing or containerization for agent execution to limit the impact of code injection.
* Perform security code reviews and penetration testing of Huginn deployments.

## Threat: [Chained Agent Compromise](./threats/chained_agent_compromise.md)

**Description:** If one agent in a scenario is compromised (through malicious creation or modification), the attacker can leverage the scenario's workflow to extend the impact. Subsequent agents in the chain will execute in the compromised context, amplifying the damage.

**Impact:** Escalated impact of agent compromise, wider reach of malicious actions, more complex and coordinated attacks, potential for cascading failures.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Scenario Management, Agent Execution Engine, Workflow Logic, Agents Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure all agents within a scenario, not just individual ones.
* Implement strong access control and monitoring across the entire scenario workflow.
* Isolate scenarios with sensitive operations from less critical ones.
* Regularly review and audit scenario configurations for potential vulnerabilities.
* If an agent is suspected of compromise, immediately disable the entire scenario.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Agent Configurations](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_agent_configurations.md)

**Description:** Agent configurations often contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens. If Huginn's data storage is compromised or access controls are weak *within Huginn*, this sensitive data can be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact:** Compromise of external accounts and services, data breaches, unauthorized access to protected resources, identity theft, financial loss.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Data Storage (Database), Agent Configuration Storage, Web UI (if displaying configurations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest in Huginn's data storage.
* Implement strong access control to Huginn's data storage and configuration management.
* Avoid storing sensitive data directly in agent configurations if possible. Use secure credential management systems or environment variables *external to Huginn if possible, or securely managed within Huginn*.
* Regularly audit agent configurations for exposed sensitive data.
* Implement secrets management practices and tools to handle API keys and credentials securely.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Huginn Storage](./threats/data_tampering_in_huginn_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Huginn's underlying data storage (database, file system) and tampers with agent configurations, scenario definitions, or data processed by agents. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and malicious manipulation of automated processes *within Huginn*.

**Impact:** Corruption of automated processes, manipulation of data used by agents, subtle and long-term attacks, data integrity issues, loss of trust in automated systems.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Data Storage (Database, File System), Agent Configuration Storage, Scenario Storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the underlying infrastructure and data storage *of Huginn*.
* Implement strong access control to the database and file system *used by Huginn*.
* Use database encryption at rest and in transit *for Huginn's database*.
* Implement data integrity checks and monitoring for data tampering *within Huginn's data*.
* Regularly back up Huginn data to ensure recoverability in case of data corruption.

## Threat: [Compromised API Keys/Credentials in Agents](./threats/compromised_api_keyscredentials_in_agents.md)

**Description:** Agents use API keys and credentials to interact with external services. If these credentials, *stored or managed by Huginn*, are compromised, attackers can abuse these external services.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, financial losses due to API abuse, reputational damage to connected services, potential legal repercussions, service disruptions.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Agent Configuration Storage, Credential Management (if any within Huginn), Integration with External Services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure credential management systems or environment variables instead of storing API keys directly in agent configurations *within Huginn*.
* Implement least privilege access for API keys, granting only necessary permissions.
* Regularly rotate API keys and credentials.
* Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
* Use API key rate limiting and usage quotas to limit the impact of compromised keys.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:** Huginn's default configuration might have insecure settings (e.g., default credentials, weak authentication, exposed management interfaces) that make it easily vulnerable to attack if not changed after installation.

**Impact:** Easy initial access for attackers, rapid compromise of the Huginn instance, widespread exploitation if many instances are deployed with default configurations.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Installation Process, Default Configuration, Authentication Module, Web UI.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Change all default credentials immediately after installation.
* Disable or secure any unnecessary default features or services.
* Follow security hardening guides for Huginn and its specific components.
* Regularly review and update Huginn's configuration to ensure security best practices are followed.
* Implement automated configuration management to enforce secure settings.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control within Huginn](./threats/insufficient_access_control_within_huginn.md)

**Description:** Weak or improperly configured access controls *within Huginn* could allow unauthorized users to create, modify, or execute agents and scenarios, or access sensitive data *managed by Huginn*. This could be due to lack of role-based access control, default permissive settings, or misconfigured permissions *within Huginn's authorization system*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data breaches, compromise of automated processes, privilege escalation within Huginn, loss of confidentiality and integrity.

**Affected Huginn Component:** Authentication Module, Authorization Module, Access Control Mechanisms, Web UI, API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user permissions based on roles *within Huginn*.
* Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only necessary permissions *within Huginn*.
* Regularly review and audit user permissions and access control configurations *within Huginn*.
* Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) *for Huginn users*.
* Monitor user activity and access logs for suspicious behavior *within Huginn*.
