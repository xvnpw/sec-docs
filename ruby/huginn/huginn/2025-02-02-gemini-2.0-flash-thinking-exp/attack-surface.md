# Attack Surface Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Agent Logic Execution](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_agent_logic_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  Execution of arbitrary code within Huginn agents due to lack of proper sandboxing or input validation.
*   **Huginn Contribution:** Huginn's core functionality allows users to write and execute Ruby code within agents. This powerful feature, if not properly secured, directly introduces the risk of arbitrary code execution.
*   **Example:** A malicious user creates an agent with Ruby code that executes system commands to read sensitive files, establish a reverse shell, or perform other malicious actions on the Huginn server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, Denial of Service (DoS), complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs to agent logic, especially user-provided code snippets. Treat all user-provided code with extreme caution.
    *   **Robust Sandboxing/Isolation:** Implement strong sandboxing or containerization for agent execution to severely limit the capabilities of agent code and contain potential breaches. Explore secure Ruby execution environments with restricted system access.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review:**  Require mandatory security code reviews for all custom agent logic before deployment, focusing on potential vulnerabilities and malicious intent.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Execution):** Run agent execution processes with the absolute minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage from successful exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization in Agent/Scenario Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_in_agentscenario_data.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process used to load agent and scenario configurations, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Huginn Contribution:** Huginn uses serialization to persist and load agent and scenario configurations. This mechanism, if using insecure deserialization practices, directly creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object and injects it into Huginn's database or configuration files (e.g., during agent import or backup restoration). When Huginn deserializes this object, it executes attacker-controlled code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, system compromise, potential for persistent compromise through database infection.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate Insecure Deserialization:**  Ideally, move away from deserialization of complex objects from untrusted sources. If necessary, use safer data formats like JSON and strictly control data structures.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries (If unavoidable):** If deserialization is essential, use secure deserialization libraries specifically designed to prevent object injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation (Serialized Data):** Validate serialized data before deserialization to detect and reject potentially malicious payloads. Implement integrity checks (e.g., signatures) for serialized data.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Deserialization Points):** Conduct focused security audits of Huginn's codebase, specifically targeting deserialization points and libraries used.
    *   **Dependency Updates (Serialization Libraries):** Keep Ruby and gem dependencies, especially serialization libraries, updated to the latest secure versions and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Agent Actions](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_agent_actions.md)

*   **Description:**  Tricking Huginn agents into making requests to unintended internal or external resources, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Huginn Contribution:** Huginn agents are designed to interact with external websites and APIs as a core function. This inherent capability, without proper URL validation, directly enables SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts an agent that, through manipulated user input or agent logic, makes a request to `http://localhost:6379` (Redis default port) to access internal Redis data, `http://internal.network/admin` to access an internal admin panel, or even to internal cloud metadata services to retrieve cloud provider credentials.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, exposure of sensitive internal data, potential for further attacks on internal systems, cloud account compromise in cloud deployments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation and Sanitization (Allowlisting):** Implement robust URL validation and sanitization for all agent actions involving external requests. Use strict allowlists of permitted domains, protocols, and ports. Blacklisting is insufficient for SSRF prevention.
    *   **Network Segmentation (Defense in Depth):** Isolate Huginn servers from sensitive internal networks and critical infrastructure.
    *   **Restrict Outbound Network Access (Firewall):** Use firewalls or network policies to strictly limit outbound network access from Huginn servers to only explicitly required external resources. Deny access to internal networks and sensitive ports.
    *   **Disable URL Redirection Following:** Configure HTTP clients used by agents to disable automatic URL redirection to prevent attackers from bypassing URL validation by redirecting to malicious URLs after initial validation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of External Service Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_external_service_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Huginn stores, manages, and uses credentials for external services, leading to potential credential leakage and unauthorized access.
*   **Huginn Contribution:** Huginn agents are designed to integrate with numerous external services, requiring the management of API keys, passwords, and tokens.  Huginn's credential management practices directly impact the security of these credentials.
*   **Example:** Credentials for a critical cloud service API are stored in plain text in Huginn's database or configuration files. An attacker gains access to the Huginn system (e.g., through RCE or database access) and retrieves these credentials, leading to compromise of the external cloud service.
*   **Impact:** Credential leakage, unauthorized access to external services, potential data breaches and service disruption on external platforms, supply chain attacks if compromised credentials are used to access critical external systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Secure Credential Storage:**  Enforce the use of secure credential storage mechanisms.  **Never store credentials in plain text in configuration files or the database.** Utilize environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted vaults.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Credentials & Permissions):** Grant agents only the absolute minimum necessary permissions and credentials for external services. Avoid using overly permissive API keys or service accounts.
    *   **Credential Rotation and Auditing:** Implement regular credential rotation for sensitive external service accounts. Implement comprehensive logging and auditing of credential access and usage.
    *   **Input Validation (Credentials Input):** If users input credentials into Huginn, ensure this input is handled securely (e.g., masked input fields, secure transmission) and validated before storage.
