# BUSINESS POSTURE

Huginn is a self-hosted system for building agents that perform automated tasks online. It allows users to automate various web-based activities, such as monitoring websites, tracking data, and interacting with online services.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Automate repetitive online tasks to improve efficiency and productivity for individuals and organizations.
- Provide a flexible and customizable platform for creating diverse automated workflows.
- Offer a self-hosted solution to give users control over their data and automation processes.
- Enable users to integrate various online services and APIs into their automated workflows.

Business Risks:
- Data privacy and security risks associated with handling sensitive information from online services and user inputs.
- Availability and reliability risks if the Huginn instance becomes unavailable, disrupting automated tasks.
- Complexity of configuration and maintenance, potentially leading to errors and misconfigurations.
- Risk of misuse for malicious purposes if not properly secured and monitored.
- Dependence on external services and APIs, which can change or become unavailable, impacting Huginn's functionality.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS for web interface access (assumed best practice for web applications).
- security control: User authentication and authorization for accessing and managing agents (likely implemented within the application).
- security control: Input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (likely implemented within the application).
- security control: Regular software updates and patching of underlying operating system and dependencies (standard system administration practice).
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying infrastructure (OS, network, hosting provider).
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- security control: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and input sanitization to protect against denial-of-service and injection attacks.
- security control: Securely manage API keys and credentials used by agents to interact with external services, potentially using a secrets management solution.
- security control: Implement logging and monitoring of security-relevant events for incident detection and response.
- security control: Conduct security code reviews as part of the development process.
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to control access to the Huginn web interface.
    - requirement: Support for strong password policies and potentially multi-factor authentication.
    - requirement: Secure session management to prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different users and actions within Huginn.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user permissions and agent capabilities.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation for all user inputs and data received from external services to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data at rest, such as API keys and user credentials, potentially using encryption.
    - requirement: Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for any encryption or hashing operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Automation of online tasks: This is the core functionality of Huginn. Disruption would impact user productivity and automated workflows.
- Data collection and processing: Agents collect and process data from various sources. Data loss or corruption would impact the integrity of automated tasks.
- Notification delivery: Huginn sends notifications to users. Failure to deliver notifications could lead to missed alerts or important updates.

Data Sensitivity:
- User credentials: Passwords and API keys used to access Huginn and external services are highly sensitive.
- Agent configurations: Agent definitions may contain sensitive information or business logic.
- Data collected by agents: Depending on the agents, collected data can range from public information to sensitive personal or business data. Sensitivity depends on the specific use case and agents configured by users. It is important to assume that data handled by Huginn can be sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scale of deployment (number of users, agents, data volume)?
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
- What is the organization's risk tolerance?
- Are there any specific security tools or technologies already in use that should be integrated with Huginn?
- What is the process for managing secrets and API keys used by agents?
- What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a functional and reliable automation platform. Security is important but balanced with usability and development speed.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls like HTTPS and user authentication are assumed to be in place.  A moderate security posture is desired, focusing on common web application security best practices.
- DESIGN: Docker Compose on a single server is a reasonable initial deployment scenario for a self-hosted application like Huginn. The build process involves standard CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions and Docker.
