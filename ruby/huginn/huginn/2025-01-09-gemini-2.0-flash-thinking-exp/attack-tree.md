## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control of the Application Leveraging Huginn Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control_of_the_application_leveraging_huginn_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success at this level means the attacker has compromised the application by exploiting weaknesses within Huginn.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Huginn's Web Interface Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_huginn's_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities present in Huginn's web interface, which is the primary way users interact with and manage Huginn.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves bypassing or subverting Huginn's authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers attempt to log in using the default administrative credentials that are often publicly known. If these credentials haven't been changed, it grants immediate and complete access to Huginn.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious scripts into the web interface that are then executed by other users' browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS via Agent Configuration (injecting malicious scripts into agent settings) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss_via_agent_configuration__injecting_malicious_scripts_into_agent_settings___high-risk_path_b0156c97.md)

Malicious scripts are injected into agent configuration parameters and stored in the database. When other users view or interact with these agents, the scripts are executed in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Agent Configuration Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_agent_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector targets the process of configuring agents, which are the building blocks of Huginn's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code/Commands via Agent Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_codecommands_via_agent_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage insecure handling of user-provided input within agent configuration parameters to inject and execute arbitrary code or commands on the server running Huginn.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure handling of user-provided input in agent parameters (e.g., command injection in shell commands) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_user-provided_input_in_agent_parameters__e_g___command_injection_in_she_5f60094d.md)

Specifically, attackers inject shell commands into agent parameters that are then executed by the system, granting them control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configure Agents to Exfiltrate Sensitive Data (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/configure_agents_to_exfiltrate_sensitive_data__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers manipulate agent configurations to cause Huginn to send sensitive data to destinations controlled by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configure agents to send data to attacker-controlled endpoints (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/configure_agents_to_send_data_to_attacker-controlled_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

Agents are configured to forward collected or processed data to external servers or services under the attacker's control, leading to data breaches.
