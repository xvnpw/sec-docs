# Threat Model Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Threat: [Malicious Agent Logic](./threats/malicious_agent_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with permissions to create or modify agents crafts an agent with malicious logic. This logic could involve actions like exfiltrating sensitive data by making unauthorized API calls *through Huginn*, deleting data within Huginn's database, or launching attacks against other systems *via Huginn's capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data processed by Huginn could be stolen, leading to privacy breaches and regulatory fines. Critical data managed by Huginn could be deleted, causing operational disruptions and data loss. Internal systems could be compromised, leading to further security breaches and lateral movement within the network *through Huginn's actions*.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Huginn's Agent execution engine, specifically when processing the `receive` and `working` methods of a custom agent. The Agent configuration storage is also affected as the malicious logic is defined there.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for agent creation and modification. Utilize Huginn's user roles and permissions effectively.
        *   Regularly review and audit agent configurations for suspicious or unauthorized logic.
        *   Consider implementing a code review process for custom agents.
        *   Explore sandboxing or containerization for agent execution to limit the impact of malicious code *within Huginn's environment*.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual agent behavior, such as excessive API calls or data exfiltration attempts *originating from Huginn*.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Agent Configurations](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_agent_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization or output encoding in agent configuration fields (e.g., URLs, API endpoints, custom code snippets). This could lead to command injection on the Huginn server if unsanitized input is used in system calls *by Huginn*, or to code execution within the agent's context *within the Huginn process*.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Huginn server leading to data breaches, service disruption, and potential control over the underlying infrastructure. Execution of arbitrary code within the agent's context could allow for data manipulation or further attacks *orchestrated through Huginn*.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent configuration parsing and processing logic within the Huginn core, specifically when handling user-provided input for agent settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input used in agent configurations. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases *from within Huginn*.
        *   Avoid directly executing user-provided strings as commands *within Huginn's processes*. If necessary, use secure libraries and limit the available commands.
        *   Implement proper output encoding to prevent code injection when displaying agent configurations *within Huginn's UI or logs*.
        *   Regularly scan Huginn's codebase for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Agent Configurations](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_agent_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**  API keys, passwords, internal URLs, or other sensitive information required for agent operation are stored insecurely within agent configurations *within Huginn*. An attacker with unauthorized access to agent configurations *within Huginn* could retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of external services or internal resources accessed by the agents using the exposed credentials *via Huginn*. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and financial loss.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent configuration storage (database or file system) and the access control mechanisms governing who can view and modify agent configurations *within Huginn*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in agent configurations *within Huginn*.
        *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and reference secrets within agent configurations *that Huginn can access securely*.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the Huginn database or configuration files.
        *   Implement strong access control policies to restrict who can view and modify agent configurations *within Huginn*.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Agent Actions](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_agent_actions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious agent that makes requests to internal or external systems based on attacker-controlled URLs or parameters *through Huginn's agent capabilities*. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services not exposed to the internet, or perform actions on behalf of the Huginn server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services and infrastructure, potential compromise of internal systems, and data breaches *initiated by Huginn*.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent actions that involve making HTTP requests or interacting with external services, particularly those where the target URL or parameters are derived from user input or event data *processed by Huginn*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs and parameters used in agent actions that make external requests *from Huginn*.
        *   Use allow-lists of permitted destination hosts or IP addresses *for Huginn's outbound requests*.
        *   Disable or restrict the use of agent actions that allow arbitrary URL specification if not strictly necessary *within Huginn*.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF attacks *originating from the Huginn server*.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls within Huginn](./threats/insufficient_access_controls_within_huginn.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or misconfigured access controls within Huginn allow unauthorized users to manage agents, scenarios, or system settings. This could allow attackers to create or modify malicious agents, disable critical workflows, or access sensitive data within Huginn.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Huginn instance, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and the ability to manipulate automated processes *orchestrated by Huginn*.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Huginn's user authentication and authorization system, including user roles, permissions, and access control enforcement points.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement and enforce the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles and permissions within Huginn.
        *   Regularly review and audit user accounts and their associated permissions *within Huginn*.
        *   Disable or remove default or unnecessary user accounts *in Huginn*.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts *accessing Huginn*.
