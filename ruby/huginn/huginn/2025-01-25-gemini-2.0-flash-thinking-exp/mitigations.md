# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhance Huginn's Agent Execution Model for Isolation (Agent Sandboxing)](./mitigation_strategies/enhance_huginn's_agent_execution_model_for_isolation__agent_sandboxing_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Modify Huginn to Support Containerized Agents:**  Extend Huginn's core agent execution logic to integrate with containerization technologies like Docker. This would involve changes in Huginn's agent scheduling and execution components.
2.  **Implement Agent Container Spawning:**  Develop functionality within Huginn to automatically spawn a new Docker container for each agent or group of agents upon execution. This would require using Docker API or similar container orchestration libraries from within Huginn's backend.
3.  **Integrate Resource Limit Configuration into Huginn:**  Add configuration options within Huginn's agent definition or settings to allow administrators to define resource limits (CPU, memory) for agent containers directly through the Huginn interface. Huginn would then pass these limits to the container runtime during agent container creation.
4.  **Explore Security Profile Integration within Huginn:** Investigate and potentially integrate security profile management (like AppArmor or SELinux profiles) into Huginn's agent containerization feature. This would allow administrators to define and apply security profiles to agent containers directly from Huginn.
5.  **Network Namespace Configuration in Huginn:**  Enhance Huginn's containerization to configure network namespaces for agent containers, providing network isolation and allowing for fine-grained network policy management from within Huginn.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Agent Escape/Host System Compromise (High Severity)
*   Inter-Agent Interference/Resource Starvation (Medium Severity)
*   Information Disclosure between Agents (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Agent Escape/Host System Compromise:  Significantly reduces the risk by providing a strong isolation boundary managed by Huginn.
*   Inter-Agent Interference/Resource Starvation:  Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing resource quotas and isolation managed by Huginn.
*   Information Disclosure between Agents:  Significantly reduces the risk by providing process-level isolation managed by Huginn.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Huginn's core agent execution is based on Ruby processes, **not containers.**
*   **No built-in containerization features exist within Huginn.**

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Huginn codebase lacks any container management or integration features for agents. This is a significant architectural change requiring substantial development within Huginn.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Agent Permission Model within Huginn](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_agent_permission_model_within_huginn.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Design a Permission System for Huginn Agents:** Define a detailed permission model within Huginn that specifies what actions agents are allowed to perform. This could include permissions for accessing specific agent types, interacting with external services, accessing Huginn internal data, and performing output actions.
2.  **Develop RBAC for Agents in Huginn:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) specifically for agents within Huginn. Define roles with varying levels of agent permissions (e.g., read-only agent, execution-only agent, configuration-capable agent).
3.  **Integrate Permission Checks into Huginn Agent Execution:** Modify Huginn's agent execution engine to enforce permission checks before agents perform actions. This would involve adding code to verify if the agent (or the user who created the agent) has the necessary permissions for each operation.
4.  **Extend Huginn's Agent Definition with Permissions:**  Enhance Huginn's agent definition schema to include permission attributes. This would allow administrators or users to configure specific permissions for each agent instance during creation or modification.
5.  **Create a Permission Management UI in Huginn:** Develop a user interface within Huginn to manage agent permissions, roles, and assignments. This would allow administrators to easily configure and audit agent access rights.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Credential Theft/Abuse (High Severity)
*   Lateral Movement after Agent Compromise (Medium Severity)
*   Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Credential Theft/Abuse:  Significantly reduces the impact by limiting the scope of compromised credentials through Huginn's permission system.
*   Lateral Movement after Agent Compromise:  Partially reduces the risk by limiting the attacker's initial access point controlled by Huginn.
*   Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:  Significantly reduces the risk by restricting write access through Huginn's permission system.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Huginn has a basic user and agent ownership model, but **lacks a fine-grained permission system for agents.**
*   Permission control is **not a feature of Huginn's agent management.**

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Huginn codebase needs a complete RBAC system for agents. This requires significant development in Huginn's core agent management and execution logic.
