## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Agents (Huginn-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_agents__huginn-specific_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege for Agents (Huginn-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Agent Configuration Review:** Within the Huginn UI, meticulously examine each Agent's configuration.
    2.  **Credential Selection:** Ensure that the Agent is using *only* the credentials (from Huginn's credential store) that are absolutely necessary for its function.  Avoid selecting credentials that grant broader access than required.
    3.  **Option Minimization:**  Provide only the minimum necessary input in the Agent's option fields.  Avoid including any unnecessary parameters or data.
    4.  **Scenario Design:** When designing scenarios, ensure that data is passed between Agents only when strictly necessary. Avoid creating scenarios that unnecessarily expose data.
    5.  **Regular Audits (Huginn UI):** Periodically (e.g., monthly) review all Agent configurations and scenarios within the Huginn UI to ensure that the principle of least privilege is still being followed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Limits an Agent's ability to access data within Huginn and through connected services, even if misconfigured or compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions (High Severity):** Restricts the actions an Agent can perform within Huginn and on connected services.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Reduces the potential for an attacker to gain broader access within Huginn or connected services.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Minimizes the scope of a potential data breach originating from a compromised Agent.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious or negligent user can do through Agent misconfiguration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Scope of potential breach significantly reduced.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Impact of malicious/negligent actions reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented through Huginn's credential system and the ability to configure individual Agents.  However, enforcement relies on user diligence.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Permission Templates (within Huginn):** Pre-defined permission templates for common Agent types, selectable within the Huginn UI.
    *   **Permission Validation (within Huginn):**  A system within Huginn to check if the selected credentials and options grant excessive permissions based on the Agent's type and description.
    *   **Dependency Graph Visualization:** A visual representation of the data flow between Agents in a scenario, highlighting potential data exposure points.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Agent Code)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__agent_code_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation and Sanitization (Agent Code)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Agent Code Modification:** This strategy requires modifying the Ruby code of the Huginn Agents themselves.
    2.  **Identify Input Points:**  Within the Agent's Ruby code, identify all `options` and `incoming_events` that receive data.
    3.  **Type Checking:**  Implement strict type checking using Ruby's built-in mechanisms (e.g., `is_a?`, `kind_of?`) to ensure that input data matches the expected type (String, Integer, Boolean, etc.).
    4.  **Format Validation (Regex):**  Use regular expressions (`=~` operator in Ruby) to validate the format of string inputs (e.g., URLs, email addresses, specific data patterns).
    5.  **Length Constraints:**  Enforce maximum lengths for string inputs using Ruby's string manipulation methods.
    6.  **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  Before using input data in any sensitive context (database queries, shell commands, HTML output), use appropriate sanitization methods:
        *   **HTML:** Use `ERB::Util.html_escape` (or similar) for data displayed in the Huginn UI.
        *   **Shell Commands:**  *Extremely carefully* sanitize data before using it in shell commands.  Consider alternatives to shell commands whenever possible.  Use `Shellwords.escape` if absolutely necessary.
        *   **Database Queries:** Use parameterized queries or the database adapter's built-in escaping mechanisms.  *Never* directly interpolate user input into SQL queries.
    7.  **Reject Invalid Input:**  If any validation or sanitization step fails, the Agent should *reject* the input and log an error.  Do not attempt to "fix" invalid input.
    8. **Automated Testing (Agent Code):** Write unit tests (using RSpec or similar) that specifically test the Agent's input validation and sanitization with a variety of valid and invalid inputs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious SQL.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious shell commands.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of arbitrary code.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Length restrictions prevent resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely partially implemented in some Agents, but not consistently or comprehensively across all Agents and their options.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Centralized Validation Library:** A shared library within the Huginn codebase that provides reusable validation and sanitization functions for all Agents.
    *   **Automated Security Linters:** Integration with security linters (e.g., Brakeman for Rails) to automatically detect potential injection vulnerabilities during development.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review (for Agent Code):** A formal requirement for code review of all Agent code changes, focusing on security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Management (Huginn UI and Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_management__huginn_ui_and_configuration_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Credential Management (Huginn UI and Configuration)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Credential Store:**  Within the Huginn UI, *always* use the built-in credential store to manage API keys, passwords, and other secrets.
    2.  **Avoid Hardcoding:**  Never enter credentials directly into Agent option fields.
    3.  **Regular Rotation (Manual):**  Manually rotate credentials for external services and update them within Huginn's credential store on a regular schedule (e.g., every 90 days).
    4. **Review and remove unused credentials:** Regularly check credentials list and remove unused.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of credentials being exposed if Agent configurations are accidentally shared or leaked.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Limits the impact of compromised credentials.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces the scope of a potential data breach.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure, Unauthorized Access, Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Huginn provides a built-in credential store, which is a core feature.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Credential Rotation (within Huginn):**  Huginn could provide features to assist with or automate credential rotation.
    *   **Credential Expiration Warnings:**  Huginn could warn users when credentials are nearing expiration.

    2.  **Identify Unused Agents:**  Determine which Agents are not being used in any of your scenarios.
    3.  **Disable Agents:** Disable the unused Agents. The specific method for disabling Agents may depend on your Huginn setup (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).  Consult the Huginn documentation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Variable Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by removing potential entry points for exploits targeting unused Agents.
    *   **Unintentional Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental misconfiguration of unused Agents that could lead to security issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduced (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Unintentional Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Huginn allows disabling Agents, although the specific mechanism might vary.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Centralized Agent Management (UI):** A more user-friendly interface within the Huginn UI for enabling and disabling Agents.
