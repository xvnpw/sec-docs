# BUSINESS POSTURE

Huginn is a self-hosted, open-source system for automating tasks. It's akin to a private, customizable version of IFTTT or Zapier. Based on the repository, the following business priorities and goals can be inferred:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide users with a flexible and powerful platform for automating online tasks.
*   Enable users to connect various services and APIs without requiring extensive coding knowledge.
*   Maintain a high degree of customizability and extensibility.
*   Foster a strong community around the project, encouraging contributions and user support.
*   Offer a self-hosted solution, giving users full control over their data and automation workflows.
*   Minimize the barrier to entry for users who want to self-host and manage their own instance.

Business Risks:

*   Data breaches: Since Huginn handles potentially sensitive user data and credentials for various online services, a data breach could expose this information, leading to significant reputational damage and potential legal liabilities.
*   Service abuse: Malicious actors could exploit Huginn's automation capabilities for spamming, denial-of-service attacks, or other harmful activities.
*   System instability: Bugs or vulnerabilities in Huginn or its dependencies could lead to system crashes, data loss, or unexpected behavior, disrupting users' workflows.
*   Maintenance burden: As an open-source project, maintaining Huginn and keeping it up-to-date with evolving web standards and security threats requires ongoing effort from the core developers and community contributors.
*   Lack of adoption: If Huginn fails to attract a sufficient user base or active contributors, the project may become stagnant and eventually unsustainable.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromised dependencies or build tools could introduce vulnerabilities into Huginn, affecting all users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Huginn uses Devise, a flexible authentication solution for Rails, to manage user accounts and logins. (Described in Gemfile and Devise documentation)
*   security control: Authorization: Basic authorization is implemented to restrict access to certain features or data based on user roles. (Mentioned in documentation and code)
*   security control: Input validation: Rails' built-in mechanisms for sanitizing and validating user input are likely used to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. (Rails guides and best practices)
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies are managed using Bundler, which helps ensure consistent and reproducible builds. (Gemfile and Gemfile.lock)
*   security control: Secrets management: Sensitive information like API keys and passwords should be stored outside the codebase, likely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution. (Mentioned in documentation and .env.example)
*   security control: Regular updates: The project appears to be actively maintained, with regular updates and bug fixes. (GitHub activity)
*   security control: HTTPS: Documentation recommends using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Self-hosting complexity: Users are responsible for setting up and maintaining their own Huginn instances, which requires technical expertise and may expose them to security risks if not done correctly.
*   accepted risk: Third-party service vulnerabilities: Huginn relies on external services and APIs, which may have their own security vulnerabilities that are outside the project's control.
*   accepted risk: Agent vulnerabilities: Custom agents created by users or the community may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   Introduce robust rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.
*   Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced account security.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure process.
*   Provide security hardening guidelines for self-hosting users.
*   Implement a sandboxing mechanism for running agents to limit their potential impact.
*   Use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools during development.
*   Use dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) tools on deployed instances.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies.
    *   Offer 2FA options.
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks.
    *   Securely store and manage user credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   Enforce least privilege principle.
    *   Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS.
    *   Validate data types and formats to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement output encoding to prevent stored XSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Securely store sensitive data at rest using encryption.
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Properly manage cryptographic keys.

3.  The CI server starts the build process.
4.  The build process includes:
    *   Running a SAST scanner (e.g., Brakeman) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   Performing a dependency check (e.g., bundler-audit) to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Building the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
5.  The SAST scanner and dependency check generate security reports.
6.  If the build is successful and security checks pass (based on predefined thresholds), the Docker image is pushed to a Docker image registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: SAST scanning: Identifies vulnerabilities in the codebase during development.
*   security control: Dependency checking: Identifies known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   security control: Build automation: Ensures consistent and reproducible builds.
*   security control: Secure Docker image build: Uses a minimal base image and follows best practices for container security.
*   security control: Image signing (recommended): Digitally sign Docker images to ensure their integrity.
