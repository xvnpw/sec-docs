# Attack Surface Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Attack Surface: [Agent Misconfiguration & Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/agent_misconfiguration_&_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Agents or those with flawed logic are the *primary* attack surface. This is fundamental to how Huginn operates.
*   **How Huginn Contributes:** Huginn's core functionality *is* the creation and configuration of Agents.  This inherent flexibility and power directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A `WebsiteAgent` set to `propagate: true` for *all* extracted data, including sensitive information unintentionally exposed on a scraped page.  Or, a `ShellCommandAgent` using unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, denial of service (internal and external), command injection, SSRF, credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for command injection, SSRF, credential theft) to **High** (for data leakage, DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Agents should have *only* the necessary permissions.
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation & Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize *all* input used by Agents, especially from external sources.  Use whitelisting.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode Agent output.
    *   **Extreme Caution with `ShellCommandAgent`:** Avoid if possible. If used, *meticulously* sanitize input.  Consider alternatives.
    *   **Regular Agent Configuration Review:**  Periodically review *all* Agent configurations.
    *   **Thorough Agent Testing:** Test with malicious input; use fuzzing.
    *   **Limit Event Propagation:** Use `propagate: false` unless strictly necessary.
    *   **Agent Resource Limits:** Prevent DoS by limiting Agent resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure (Huginn's Credential Storage)](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure__huginn's_credential_storage_.md)

*   **Description:** Huginn stores credentials for Agents to interact with services, making these credentials a prime target.
*   **How Huginn Contributes:** Huginn *requires* credential storage for many of its core Agent functionalities. This is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Huginn database and extracts stored API keys and passwords.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of connected services, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Encryption:** Use robust, industry-standard encryption for credentials at rest.
    *   **Secure Database:** Implement strong security for the Huginn database.
    *   **Secrets Management Solution:** *Integrate* with a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault). This is the best practice.
    *   **Avoid Credential Reuse:** Encourage users not to reuse credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Agents](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_agents.md)

*   **Description:** Agents that make HTTP requests (e.g., `WebsiteAgent`, `PostAgent`) can be exploited for SSRF.
*   **How Huginn Contributes:** Huginn's Agents are *designed* to interact with web resources, making SSRF a direct and inherent risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker configures a `WebsiteAgent` to access an internal service or a cloud metadata endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **URL Whitelisting:** Restrict Agent access to a predefined list of allowed URLs, if feasible.
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** Reject URLs pointing to internal IPs or sensitive endpoints.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Limit Huginn's network access to internal resources.
    *   **Disable Localhost Access:** Explicitly disallow connections to `localhost`.
    * **Use a dedicated HTTP client with SSRF protection:** Configure Agents to use HTTP client that has built-in protection against SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (via `ShellCommandAgent` and similar)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__via__shellcommandagent__and_similar_.md)

*   **Description:** Agents executing shell commands are extremely vulnerable to command injection.
*   **How Huginn Contributes:** The `ShellCommandAgent` provides *direct* shell access, making this a Huginn-specific risk.
*   **Example:** Unsanitized user input containing shell metacharacters allows arbitrary command execution.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data loss, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `ShellCommandAgent`:** This is the *primary* recommendation.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** If unavoidable, use *extremely* strict whitelisting and escaping.
    *   **Parameterized Commands:** Use APIs that avoid shell escaping, if possible.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Huginn with minimal privileges.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run `ShellCommandAgent` in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** User-created custom Agents can introduce a wide range of vulnerabilities.
*   **How Huginn Contributes:** Huginn's *extensibility* through custom Agents directly creates this risk.
*   **Example:** A custom Agent with a SQL injection vulnerability due to poor input handling.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely; could include any of the above (data leakage, command injection, DoS, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Review:** *Thoroughly* review *all* custom Agent code before deployment.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Enforce secure coding practices for custom Agent development.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate custom Agents to limit their impact.
    *   **Extensive Testing:** Test custom Agents thoroughly, including with malicious input.
    *   **Documentation:** Require clear documentation, including security considerations.
    * **Limit capabilities:** Limit capabilities of custom agents to bare minimum.
