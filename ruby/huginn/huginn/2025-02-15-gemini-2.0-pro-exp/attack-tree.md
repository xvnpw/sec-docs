## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE):**

    *   **1.1.1 Shell Agent (Unsafe Configuration) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into the `command` option of a Huginn Shell Agent, typically through a compromised upstream data source or direct user input (if allowed). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Huginn.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.2 Data Leakage:**

    *   **1.2.1 Leaky Website Agent (Extract Sensitive Data) [High-Risk]:**
        *   **Description:** A misconfigured Website Agent, or one targeting a website that has unexpectedly changed its structure, extracts sensitive information (API keys, session tokens, PII) that was not intended to be exposed. This data can then be used in further attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Huginn Core/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_huginn_coredependencies.md)

*   **2.1 Dependency Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **2.1.1 Known CVE in a gem used by Huginn [High-Risk]:**
        *   **Description:** Huginn uses various Ruby gems as dependencies. If any of these gems have known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs), an attacker can exploit them to gain control of the Huginn system. The specific impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse Huginn's Intended Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_huginn's_intended_functionality.md)

*   **3.1 Agent Misconfiguration:**

    *   **3.1.1 Overly Permissive Agent [High-Risk]:**
        *   **Description:** An Agent is configured with more permissions than it needs to function. For example, a Website Agent might be given write access to a database, or a Shell Agent might have unrestricted command execution capabilities. This allows an attacker to abuse the Agent's functionality for malicious purposes.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **3.2 Credential Stuffing/Reuse:**

    *   **3.2.1 Brute-force Huginn Login (if unprotected) [High-Risk]:**
        *   **Description:**  If Huginn lacks protection against brute-force attacks (rate limiting, account lockout), an attacker can try numerous password combinations to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if no protection)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **3.2.2 Exploit Weak Huginn API Key (if exposed) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** If a Huginn API key is weak, easily guessable, or accidentally exposed (e.g., in a public code repository or through a misconfigured Agent), an attacker can use it to gain full control over the Huginn instance.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if managed securely) / High (if exposed)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **3.2.3 Leverage Stolen Huginn Credentials [High-Risk]:**
        *   **Description:** If a user reuses their Huginn password on other services, and those services are compromised, the attacker can use the stolen credentials to access Huginn (credential stuffing).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
