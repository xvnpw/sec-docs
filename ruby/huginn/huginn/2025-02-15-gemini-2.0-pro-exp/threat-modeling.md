# Threat Model Analysis for huginn/huginn

## Threat: [Agent Impersonation via Malicious Agent Import](./threats/agent_impersonation_via_malicious_agent_import.md)

*   **Threat:** Agent Impersonation via Malicious Agent Import

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Huginn agent configuration file (JSON) and distributes it through social engineering (e.g., phishing email, malicious website). A user, believing the agent to be legitimate, imports it into their Huginn instance. The malicious agent mimics the behavior of a trusted agent.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to data processed by the impersonated agent, potentially including credentials for connected services. The attacker can also trigger actions performed by the impersonated agent, leading to unauthorized data modification, service disruption, or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent import functionality (`AgentsController#import`), Agent execution engine (various agent types).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement a robust agent import validation process.  Check for suspicious patterns, known malicious code snippets, and excessive permission requests. Consider digital signatures or checksum verification for trusted agent sources.
        *   **Developer:** Implement agent sandboxing (e.g., using containers or restricted execution environments) to limit the capabilities of imported agents.
        *   **User:**  Only import agents from trusted sources (e.g., official Huginn repositories, known developers).  Carefully review the agent's configuration *before* importing it. Be wary of unsolicited agent configurations.
        *   **User:** Regularly audit imported agents and their permissions.

## Threat: [Credential Disclosure via Agent Log Files](./threats/credential_disclosure_via_agent_log_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Disclosure via Agent Log Files

    *   **Description:** An agent is configured to interact with an external service using API keys or passwords.  Due to improper error handling or verbose logging within the agent's code, these credentials are inadvertently written to the Huginn log files. An attacker gains access to the log files (e.g., through a separate vulnerability, misconfigured file permissions, or social engineering).
    *   **Impact:** The attacker obtains valid credentials for the external service, allowing them to access the service with the privileges of the Huginn user. This can lead to data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent logging mechanism (`lib/huginn/agent.rb`, specific agent implementations), Log rotation and storage configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement a centralized credential management system within Huginn.  Agents should *never* store credentials directly in their configuration or code.  Instead, they should reference credentials stored securely (e.g., encrypted database, environment variables).
        *   **Developer:**  Implement robust data redaction in the logging mechanism.  Automatically detect and remove sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) from log entries.
        *   **Developer:** Provide clear guidelines and best practices for agent developers on how to handle credentials securely and avoid logging sensitive data.
        *   **User:**  Regularly review agent logs for any signs of credential leakage.  Configure log rotation and secure storage to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
        *   **User:** Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution to provide credentials to Huginn, rather than hardcoding them in agent configurations.

## Threat: [Agent Configuration Tampering via Unauthorized Access](./threats/agent_configuration_tampering_via_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Agent Configuration Tampering via Unauthorized Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Huginn web interface (e.g., through weak passwords, compromised user accounts, or a separate web vulnerability). The attacker modifies the configuration of existing agents, changing their schedules, data sources, or actions.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can redirect data flows, trigger unintended actions (e.g., sending spam emails, deleting data), exfiltrate sensitive information, or disrupt the normal operation of the system.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** `AgentsController` (specifically `update` and `edit` actions), Agent configuration storage (database).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Huginn web interface.  Enforce strong password policies and consider multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all agent configuration parameters.  Prevent attackers from injecting malicious code or unexpected values.
        *   **Developer:** Implement a comprehensive audit trail for all agent configuration changes.  Record who made the change, when it was made, and the previous and new values.
        *   **User:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all Huginn user accounts.  Regularly review user accounts and permissions.
        *   **User:** Enable and monitor the audit trail for agent configuration changes.

## Threat: [Cross-Agent Data Leakage](./threats/cross-agent_data_leakage.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Agent Data Leakage

    *   **Description:**  Due to a flaw in agent isolation or a misconfiguration, data intended for one agent becomes accessible to another agent. This could happen if agents share a common temporary storage location, or if there's a vulnerability in the data handling logic within Huginn.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive information intended for one agent is leaked to another agent, potentially controlled by a different user or even an attacker. This can lead to data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Agent communication and data handling mechanisms (`lib/huginn/agent.rb`, `memory` handling), Agent isolation mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Implement strong data isolation between agents.  Ensure that agents cannot access data or resources belonging to other agents unless explicitly authorized.
        *   **Developer:**  Review and strengthen the agent communication and data handling mechanisms to prevent unintended data leakage.
        *   **Developer:** Consider using separate namespaces or sandboxes for each agent to further enhance isolation.
        *   **User:**  Carefully design agent workflows to minimize the risk of data sharing between agents.  Avoid using shared temporary storage locations unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **User:** Regularly review agent configurations and permissions to ensure that data is only accessible to authorized agents.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Huginn Process](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_huginn_process.md)

*  **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Huginn Process

    *   **Description:** The Huginn process itself (or the user account under which it runs) has excessive privileges on the host system (e.g., running as root). An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Huginn (e.g., a code injection vulnerability in an agent) to gain control of the Huginn process.
    *   **Impact:** Because the Huginn process has elevated privileges, the attacker gains full control of the host system, not just the Huginn instance. This is a complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Huginn Component:** Entire Huginn application, system-level configuration of the Huginn process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Follow the principle of least privilege.  The Huginn process should run with the *minimum* necessary privileges on the host system.  *Never* run Huginn as root.
        *   **Developer:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization throughout the Huginn codebase to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developer:** Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate the Huginn process from the host system.
        *   **User:**  Configure the Huginn process to run under a dedicated, unprivileged user account.
        *   **User:** Regularly update Huginn to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities.
