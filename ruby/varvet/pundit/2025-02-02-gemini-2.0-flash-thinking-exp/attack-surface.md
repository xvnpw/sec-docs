# Attack Surface Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Attack Surface: [1. Policy Bypass due to Incorrect Policy Application](./attack_surfaces/1__policy_bypass_due_to_incorrect_policy_application.md)

*   **Description:** Authorization checks are missed in code, leaving endpoints or actions unprotected.
*   **Pundit Contribution:** Pundit's security relies on developers explicitly invoking `authorize` and `policy_scope`. Forgetting these calls completely bypasses Pundit's authorization mechanism.
*   **Example:** A developer creates a new feature to delete user accounts but forgets to include `authorize @user, :destroy?` in the controller action. An attacker could then directly access the delete user endpoint and delete any user account without authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical actions, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement rigorous code reviews with a strong focus on authorization logic to ensure `authorize` and `policy_scope` are consistently applied in all relevant controllers and services.
    *   **Comprehensive Integration Testing:** Develop integration tests that specifically verify authorization checks for all critical endpoints and actions, simulating various user roles and permissions.
    *   **Strict Development Guidelines & Checklists:** Establish and enforce clear development guidelines and checklists that mandate the use of Pundit for authorization for every action that requires access control.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools or linters into the development pipeline to automatically detect missing `authorize` or `policy_scope` calls in critical code paths before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [2. Policy Logic Flaws and Overly Permissive Policies](./attack_surfaces/2__policy_logic_flaws_and_overly_permissive_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Policies contain logical errors or are written too broadly, granting access to users who should not have it.
*   **Pundit Contribution:** Pundit policies are code and are susceptible to logical errors.  Incorrectly written policies directly lead to authorization vulnerabilities within the Pundit framework.
*   **Example:** A policy intended to allow only authors and admins to edit posts incorrectly uses the condition `user.admin? || record.user == user` instead of `user.admin? || record.author == user`. This allows any logged-in user to edit any post where the *post's user* (which might be different from the author) matches the current user, instead of the intended author check.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of data integrity and confidentiality due to overly broad access permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of the resources protected by the flawed policy and the scope of unintended access).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Policy Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests for all Pundit policies, covering a wide range of scenarios, user roles, resource states, and edge cases to rigorously validate policy logic and ensure correctness.
    *   **Dedicated Security Policy Reviews:** Conduct specific security-focused code reviews of all Pundit policies by security experts or experienced developers to identify potential logical flaws, overly permissive rules, and unintended consequences.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Policy Design:** Design policies strictly adhering to the principle of least privilege, granting only the absolute minimum necessary permissions required for each role or user to perform their legitimate actions.
    *   **Regular Policy Audits and Updates:** Implement a process for regularly auditing and reviewing existing policies to ensure they remain accurate, up-to-date with application requirements, and aligned with current security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerabilities in Custom Policy Resolution Logic (If Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerabilities_in_custom_policy_resolution_logic__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom logic implemented to extend Pundit's policy resolution mechanism introduces vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
*   **Pundit Contribution:** Pundit's extensibility allows for custom policy resolution. If developers implement this custom logic insecurely, it becomes a direct attack surface within the Pundit authorization framework.
*   **Example:** Custom policy resolution logic uses user-controlled input to dynamically determine the policy class name to instantiate. An attacker could manipulate this input to inject and load arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution if a malicious class is loaded and executed.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially critical vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, complete authorization bypass, and other severe security flaws depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability in the custom resolution logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (highly dependent on the nature of the custom logic and the severity of the introduced vulnerability, RCE being critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Custom Policy Resolution if Possible:** Minimize or completely avoid implementing custom policy resolution logic. Stick to Pundit's standard and well-tested conventions whenever feasible.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Logic:** If custom logic is absolutely necessary, ensure it is developed following secure coding practices, with a strong emphasis on input validation, output encoding, and secure class loading mechanisms.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Carefully validate and sanitize all input used in custom policy resolution logic to prevent injection vulnerabilities, especially when constructing class names or paths dynamically.
    *   **Secure Class Loading Mechanisms:** If dynamic class loading is required, use secure and restricted class loading mechanisms to prevent loading arbitrary or malicious classes from untrusted sources. Thoroughly review and test any custom class loading implementation.
