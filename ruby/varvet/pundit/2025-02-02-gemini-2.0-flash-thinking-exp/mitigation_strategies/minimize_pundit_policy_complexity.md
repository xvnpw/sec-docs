    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  The strategy is highly effective in mitigating this threat. By reducing complexity, the likelihood of introducing logical errors during policy development and maintenance is significantly reduced.
    *   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - This is a reasonable assessment. Logic errors in authorization can lead to serious vulnerabilities, but the severity is often context-dependent. Medium severity is appropriate as it acknowledges the potential for unauthorized access without being catastrophic in all scenarios.

*   **Maintainability Issues with Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The strategy is highly effective in mitigating this threat. By focusing on readability, decomposition, and refactoring, the strategy directly addresses the root causes of maintainability issues in complex code.
    *   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - This is also a reasonable assessment. Maintainability issues, while not directly exploitable vulnerabilities, increase the risk of introducing vulnerabilities over time due to errors during updates and modifications. Medium severity reflects the long-term security implications of poor maintainability.

#### 4.6. Analysis of Current and Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   "Pundit policies are generally kept relatively simple in the current implementation." - This is a positive starting point, indicating an existing awareness of policy complexity.
    *   "Basic refactoring of Pundit policies is sometimes done during code reviews." - This shows some proactive effort towards maintainability, but it's not formalized or consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   "No formal guidelines or metrics for Pundit policy complexity are defined..." - This is a significant gap. Without guidelines and metrics, the strategy lacks concrete direction and measurability. Complexity management becomes ad-hoc and inconsistent.
    *   "...Proactive refactoring specifically for Pundit policy simplification is not regularly performed..." - This indicates a reactive approach to complexity. Proactive refactoring is essential to prevent policies from becoming overly complex in the first place.
