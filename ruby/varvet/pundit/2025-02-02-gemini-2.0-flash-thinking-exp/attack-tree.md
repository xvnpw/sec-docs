## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Policy Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_policy_logic_flaws__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Incorrect Conditional Logic in Policies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers identify and exploit overly permissive conditions within policy methods. This could involve crafting requests or manipulating data to satisfy these flawed conditions, granting them unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A policy allows access if `user.role == 'user' OR record.owner == user`. If the intention was to only allow access for owners, the `OR user.role == 'user'` is a flaw that can be exploited by any user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, ability to perform unauthorized actions.

*   **Logic Errors in Complex Policies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers analyze complex policy logic, especially nested conditionals or intricate boolean expressions, to find unintended logical flaws. These flaws can be manipulated to bypass authorization checks.
    *   **Example:** A complex policy with multiple nested `if/else` statements might have a branch that is unintentionally reachable under specific conditions, leading to an authorization bypass.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of intended access controls, potentially leading to broad unauthorized access depending on the scope of the flawed policy.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Bypass Policy Enforcement in Controllers [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__bypass_policy_enforcement_in_controllers__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Missing `authorize` Calls in Controller Actions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to include the `authorize` method call in controller actions that require authorization. This leaves these actions unprotected, allowing any user (or even unauthenticated users if authentication is also missing) to access them.
    *   **Example:** A controller action for deleting a user profile lacks the `authorize @user, :destroy?` call. An attacker can directly access this action and delete any user profile, bypassing Pundit's intended authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of authorization for specific controller actions, potentially exposing critical functionalities and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit User Context Issues Affecting Pundit [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_user_context_issues_affecting_pundit__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Compromise User Identity Leading to Incorrect Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise user credentials or sessions through common web vulnerabilities like session hijacking, credential stuffing, or phishing. Once they gain access with a legitimate user's identity, Pundit will authorize actions based on *that* user's roles and permissions, even if the attacker is not authorized.
    *   **Example:** An attacker hijacks an administrator's session. Pundit will correctly authorize actions as if the administrator is performing them, even though it's the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to resources and functionalities as the compromised user, potentially including administrative privileges if an admin account is compromised.

*   **Privilege Escalation Leading to Pundit Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the application (unrelated to Pundit itself) to elevate their privileges. This could be through SQL injection, insecure direct object references, or other privilege escalation flaws. Once privileges are elevated, Pundit will authorize actions based on the *attacker's now-elevated* role, even if they should not have those privileges.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to change their user role in the database from 'user' to 'admin'. Pundit will now treat them as an administrator, granting them access to admin functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Gaining higher-level privileges than intended, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive administrative functions and data, effectively bypassing role-based authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Default Policy Issues (If Implemented Insecurely) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__default_policy_issues__if_implemented_insecurely___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses a default policy (e.g., a `DefaultPolicy` class in Pundit), and this default policy is designed to be overly permissive (e.g., allows all actions by default), attackers can exploit this. If specific policies are missing for certain actions or resources, the permissive default policy will kick in, granting unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A `DefaultPolicy` is set up to always return `true` for all actions if a specific policy is not found. If a developer forgets to create a policy for a new feature, the default policy will unintentionally allow everyone to access it.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread unauthorized access across the application for any actions or resources that lack specific policies, due to the overly permissive default behavior.
