# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Test Policy Logic](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_test_policy_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Unit Tests for Policies:** For each Pundit policy class, write dedicated unit tests specifically targeting the policy logic.
    2.  **Test Each Policy Action:** Within each policy test, create test cases for every action (e.g., `index?`, `show?`, `create?`) defined in the policy.
    3.  **Test Policy Logic with Different User Contexts:** Simulate different user roles and permissions within the policy tests to ensure the logic correctly handles various user contexts as understood by Pundit.
    4.  **Integration Tests for Policy Enforcement:** Write integration tests that verify Pundit policies are correctly invoked and enforced within controllers and views using `authorize` and `policy_scope` methods.
    5.  **Code Reviews of Policy Implementations:** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on the logic and correctness of Pundit policy implementations.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):**  Flawed Pundit policy logic can grant access to resources or actions that users should not be able to access due to incorrect authorization rules.
        *   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):** Incorrect Pundit policies might allow unauthorized users to create, update, or delete data because the authorization logic is flawed.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Logic errors within Pundit policies could lead to users gaining higher privileges than intended, bypassing intended authorization boundaries.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Data Manipulation:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Unit tests for `PostPolicy` and `CommentPolicy` are implemented in `spec/policies` directory, focusing on testing Pundit policy methods.
        *   Basic integration tests for `PostsController` are present in `spec/controllers`, verifying Pundit's `authorize` calls.
        *   Code reviews are performed for major feature branches, including review of Pundit policies within those features.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive unit tests are missing for some complex policy actions, especially around edge cases and nuanced Pundit policy logic.
        *   Integration tests need to be expanded to cover all controllers and actions that rely on Pundit for authorization enforcement.
        *   Code reviews should consistently include a dedicated focus on the correctness and security of Pundit policy implementations, even for minor changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Policy Checks Consistently using Pundit's `authorize` and `policy_scope`](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_policy_checks_consistently_using_pundit's__authorize__and__policy_scope_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Controller `authorize` Usage:** In every controller action requiring authorization, explicitly call Pundit's `authorize @resource` (or `authorize ResourceClass`) before proceeding with the action.
    2.  **View `policy` Helper Usage:** In views, consistently use Pundit's `policy(@resource).action?` helper to conditionally render UI elements based on user permissions determined by Pundit.
    3.  **Code Review Focus on Pundit Calls:** Create a code review checklist that specifically includes verifying the presence and correct usage of Pundit's `authorize` and `policy` calls in relevant controllers and views.
    4.  **Static Analysis for Pundit Usage:** Configure static analysis tools or linters to detect missing or incorrect usage of Pundit's `authorize` or `policy_scope` methods in controllers and views.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Bypass Pundit Authorization (High Severity):** Forgetting to implement Pundit's `authorize` checks leaves endpoints unprotected by Pundit, allowing anyone to perform actions that should be authorized.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):**  Without Pundit's authorization checks, users can access data that Pundit policies are designed to protect.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):**  Missing Pundit checks can lead to unauthorized creation, update, or deletion of data, bypassing Pundit's intended authorization controls.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Bypass Pundit Authorization:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** High Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Pundit's `authorize` is generally used in controllers for standard CRUD actions on `Post` and `Comment` resources.
        *   Basic view authorization using Pundit's `policy` helper is implemented for showing edit/delete links for posts.
        *   Code reviews sometimes check for Pundit usage, but not as a primary, consistent focus.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Pundit's `authorize` checks are sometimes missed in less common controller actions or newly added endpoints, especially when developers are not explicitly thinking about Pundit.
        *   View authorization using Pundit's `policy` helper is not consistently applied across all views and UI elements where authorization is relevant.
        *   Static analysis tools are not specifically configured to check for comprehensive and correct Pundit usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust `policy_scope` Usage in Pundit Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust__policy_scope__usage_in_pundit_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Correct Filtering Logic in `policy_scope`:**  Ensure that `policy_scope` methods within Pundit policies correctly implement filtering logic to return only authorized records based on user permissions as defined by Pundit.
    2.  **Test `policy_scope` Methods Specifically:** Write unit tests dedicated to testing `policy_scope` methods in Pundit policies, verifying they return the expected filtered subset of records for different user roles and authorization scenarios within Pundit's context.
    3.  **Consistent Use of `policy_scope` in Controllers:**  Consistently use Pundit's `policy_scope(ResourceClass)` in controller index actions and any other actions that return collections of resources, ensuring Pundit's filtering is applied.
    4.  **Avoid Bypassing Pundit's `policy_scope`:**  Train developers to always utilize Pundit's `policy_scope` when fetching collections to ensure Pundit-driven authorization filtering is applied and avoid direct database queries that bypass Pundit.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Exposure via Collections (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect Pundit `policy_scope` implementations can expose lists of resources that users should not be aware of, even if individual record authorization via Pundit is in place.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Pundit Bypass (Medium Severity):**  Exposing unauthorized resource lists due to flawed Pundit `policy_scope` can leak sensitive information about the application's data structure or content, undermining Pundit's intended data protection.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Exposure via Collections:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Information Disclosure through Pundit Bypass:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Pundit's `policy_scope` is implemented in `PostPolicy` and `CommentPolicy` to filter index actions, leveraging Pundit's scope resolution.
        *   Basic tests exist for `policy_scope` in `PostPolicy`, verifying Pundit's scope filtering.
        *   Controllers generally use Pundit's `policy_scope` for index actions to apply Pundit's authorization at the collection level.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `policy_scope` tests are not comprehensive and might not cover all filtering scenarios and edge cases within Pundit's scope resolution logic.
        *   Pundit's `policy_scope` might be missed in some controller actions that return collections, especially in newer features or less frequently used endpoints where Pundit integration might be overlooked.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Pundit's `NotAuthorizedError` Gracefully and Securely](./mitigation_strategies/handle_pundit's__notauthorizederror__gracefully_and_securely.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Global Exception Handler for `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`:** In your application's exception handling, specifically add a handler for Pundit's `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` exception.
    2.  **Generic User-Facing Error Message for Pundit Failures:** Within the handler for `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`, return a generic, user-friendly error message like "You are not authorized to perform this action." or "Access Denied."  Avoid revealing specific details about *why* Pundit authorization failed.
    3.  **Detailed Logging of Pundit Exceptions:** Log the full exception details of `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`, including policy name, action, user information, and backtrace, to server logs for debugging and security auditing related to Pundit authorization failures.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Leakage via Pundit Errors (Low Severity):**  Detailed error messages from Pundit's `NotAuthorizedError` could inadvertently reveal information about application structure or resource existence to unauthorized users by exposing internal Pundit authorization details.
        *   **Security Through Obscurity (related to Pundit errors) (Low Severity):** While not a primary security mechanism, preventing detailed Pundit error messages reduces potential information available to attackers about the Pundit authorization system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Leakage via Pundit Errors:** Low Risk Reduction
        *   **Security Through Obscurity (related to Pundit errors):** Low Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A global exception handler for `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` is implemented in `ApplicationController`, specifically to handle Pundit authorization failures.
        *   A generic "Access Denied" message is displayed to users when Pundit authorization fails.
        *   Exceptions, including `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`, are logged to `log/production.log`, capturing details of Pundit authorization failures.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Logging of `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` might not consistently include sufficient user context or Pundit policy details for effective debugging and auditing of Pundit authorization issues.
        *   Log access control needs to be reviewed to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive error logs containing details of Pundit authorization failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Update Pundit Policies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_update_pundit_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Scheduled Reviews of Pundit Policies:** Establish a recurring schedule for reviewing all Pundit policies to ensure they remain accurate and aligned with current authorization requirements.
    2.  **Policy Reviews Triggered by Authorization Changes:** Incorporate Pundit policy reviews into the development lifecycle, specifically when adding new features, modifying existing features, or changing user roles and permissions that directly impact Pundit authorization rules.
    3.  **Documentation of Pundit Policy Rationale:** Document the reasoning and intent behind each Pundit policy rule to facilitate understanding and future reviews of Pundit authorization logic.
    4.  **Version Control for Pundit Policies:** Track all changes to Pundit policies in version control (Git) to enable rollback and maintain an audit history of Pundit authorization rule modifications.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Pundit Policy Drift (Medium Severity):**  Pundit policies becoming outdated and misaligned with current application requirements, leading to either overly permissive or restrictive access due to outdated Pundit rules.
        *   **Accumulated Errors in Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**  Small errors in Pundit policies accumulating over time and becoming significant vulnerabilities in the Pundit authorization system.
        *   **Authorization Gaps due to Pundit Neglect (Medium Severity):**  New features or changes introduced without corresponding updates to Pundit policies, creating authorization gaps in the Pundit-managed authorization framework.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Pundit Policy Drift:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Accumulated Errors in Pundit Policies:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Authorization Gaps due to Pundit Neglect:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Pundit policies are under version control, allowing tracking of changes to Pundit authorization rules.
        *   Pundit policy changes are sometimes discussed during code reviews for related features, considering the impact on Pundit authorization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal schedule for regular reviews of Pundit policies exists, leading to potential neglect of Pundit authorization rules over time.
        *   Documentation of Pundit policy rationale is inconsistent, making reviews and updates of Pundit authorization logic more challenging.
        *   Policy review checklist specifically for Pundit policies is not defined, potentially missing key aspects of Pundit authorization review.
        *   Pundit policy reviews are not consistently triggered by application changes that impact authorization, potentially leading to outdated Pundit rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Pundit Policy Complexity](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_pundit_policy_complexity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Keep Pundit Policies Concise and Readable:** Strive for clear and concise policy logic within Pundit policies. Avoid overly complex conditional statements or deeply nested logic in Pundit rules.
    2.  **Break Down Complex Pundit Policies:** If a Pundit policy becomes too complex, break it down into smaller, more manageable policy classes or helper methods to improve the clarity of Pundit authorization logic.
    3.  **Refactor Pundit Policies for Readability:** Regularly refactor Pundit policies to improve readability and remove redundancy in Pundit authorization rules. Use meaningful method names and comments within Pundit policies.
    4.  **Helper Methods/Service Objects for Pundit Logic:** Encapsulate complex authorization logic used within Pundit policies into helper methods or dedicated service objects called from policies to improve organization and testability of Pundit authorization rules.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Logic Errors in Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**  Complex Pundit policies are more prone to logical errors in their authorization rules that can lead to vulnerabilities in the Pundit authorization system.
        *   **Maintainability Issues with Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**  Complex Pundit policies are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing the risk of introducing errors during updates to Pundit authorization rules.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Logic Errors in Pundit Policies:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Maintainability Issues with Pundit Policies:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Pundit policies are generally kept relatively simple in the current implementation.
        *   Basic refactoring of Pundit policies is sometimes done during code reviews.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal guidelines or metrics for Pundit policy complexity are defined, potentially leading to inconsistent complexity levels in Pundit authorization rules.
        *   Proactive refactoring specifically for Pundit policy simplification is not regularly performed, potentially allowing Pundit authorization logic to become unnecessarily complex over time.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Pundit Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_pundit_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Pundit Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating the Pundit library itself to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and potential improvements in Pundit.
    2.  **Security Monitoring for Pundit:** Monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for Pundit to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and necessary updates in the Pundit library.
    3.  **Prompt Patching of Pundit Vulnerabilities:**  When vulnerabilities are identified in Pundit, prioritize patching and updating Pundit promptly to mitigate known security risks in the authorization library.
    4.  **Testing After Pundit Updates:**  After updating Pundit, run comprehensive tests (unit, integration, system) to ensure no regressions or compatibility issues are introduced by the Pundit update, especially in authorization behavior.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Pundit Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Using outdated versions of Pundit exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities within the Pundit library itself that have been publicly disclosed and potentially exploited.
        *   **Zero-Day Pundit Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Risk):** While updates don't prevent zero-day vulnerabilities in Pundit, staying up-to-date reduces the window of exposure and increases the likelihood of receiving timely patches for newly discovered Pundit vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Pundit Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Zero-Day Pundit Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Dependencies, including Pundit, are updated periodically, but not on a strict schedule specifically focused on Pundit security updates.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal process for monitoring security advisories and prioritizing updates specifically for Pundit exists, potentially delaying critical Pundit security patches.
        *   Testing after Pundit updates is not always comprehensive, potentially missing regressions or compatibility issues introduced by Pundit updates that could affect authorization.
