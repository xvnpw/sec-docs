# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Pundit GitHub repository, aims to provide a robust and flexible authorization system for Ruby applications. The primary business goal is to empower developers to easily implement fine-grained access control within their applications, enhancing security and data protection.

Business priorities include:

*   Ease of integration and use for Ruby developers.
*   Flexibility to accommodate diverse authorization logic and application requirements.
*   Maintainability and long-term support to ensure continued security and reliability.
*   Performance efficiency to minimize impact on application responsiveness.

Key business risks associated with this project are:

*   Authorization bypass vulnerabilities in Pundit itself could lead to unauthorized access to application resources and data.
*   Incorrect implementation or misconfiguration of Pundit by developers could result in unintended security gaps.
*   Lack of ongoing maintenance and security updates could leave applications vulnerable to newly discovered threats.
*   Performance bottlenecks introduced by complex authorization logic could negatively impact user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Pundit project include:

*   security control Open source nature, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Described in: GitHub repository being publicly accessible.
*   security control Unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of authorization logic. Described in: Test suite within the GitHub repository.
*   security control Reliance on RubyGems for distribution, which provides a level of package integrity and versioning. Described in: RubyGems packaging and distribution process.

Accepted risks for the Pundit project include:

*   accepted risk Dependence on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in dependencies used by Pundit.
*   accepted risk Risk of developers misusing or misconfiguring Pundit, leading to security issues in their applications.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture of Pundit:

*   recommended security control Implement static application security testing (SAST) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   recommended security control Integrate dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Pundit.
*   recommended security control Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process to handle security issues reported by the community.
*   recommended security control Provide comprehensive security documentation and best practices for developers using Pundit to minimize misconfiguration risks.

Security requirements for the Pundit project:

*   Authentication: Pundit itself does not handle authentication, but it is assumed that applications using Pundit will have a robust authentication mechanism in place to identify users.
*   Authorization: Pundit's core function is authorization. It must provide a flexible and secure way to define and enforce access control policies based on user roles, permissions, and context.
*   Input Validation: Pundit policies should validate inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities arising from malformed or malicious data.
*   Cryptography: While Pundit may not directly implement cryptography, it should be designed to be compatible with applications that utilize cryptographic mechanisms for data protection and secure communication.

# DESIGN

The Pundit project is a Ruby library designed to provide authorization capabilities to Ruby applications. It is not a standalone application or service but rather a component integrated into other systems.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Pundit are authorization and access control within Ruby applications. This includes ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform certain actions.

Data being protected depends on the application using Pundit. It can range from non-sensitive public data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The sensitivity of the data directly impacts the criticality of robust authorization.

Examples of data sensitivity levels:

*   Low Sensitivity: Publicly available blog posts, marketing materials. Authorization might be needed to control who can create or edit these.
*   Medium Sensitivity: User profiles, order history, internal documents. Authorization is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   High Sensitivity: Financial transactions, medical records, personal identifiable information (PII). Strict authorization is paramount to comply with regulations and protect user privacy.

The impact of a security breach due to authorization failures can range from minor inconvenience to significant financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and privacy violations, depending on the sensitivity of the data and the nature of the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   What are the primary use cases and types of applications for which Pundit is intended (e.g., web applications, APIs, background jobs)?
*   Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using Pundit might need to adhere to?
*   What is the expected scale and performance requirements for authorization checks in typical Pundit deployments?
*   Are there any known limitations or edge cases in Pundit's authorization logic that developers should be aware of from a security perspective?

Assumptions:

*   It is assumed that applications using Pundit will implement proper authentication mechanisms to identify users before authorization checks are performed.
*   It is assumed that developers using Pundit have a basic understanding of authorization concepts and secure coding practices.
*   It is assumed that Pundit is intended to be used in environments where security and access control are important considerations.
*   It is assumed that the Ruby applications integrating Pundit will be deployed in environments with standard security measures in place, such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and regular security updates.
