# Threat Model Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Threat: [Insecure Policy Logic](./threats/insecure_policy_logic.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to exploit flaws in the logic of a Pundit policy to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they should not be permitted to. This could involve crafting specific requests or manipulating data in a way that bypasses the intended authorization checks within the policy. For example, an attacker might find a logical error in a conditional statement that grants access based on incorrect criteria.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of resources, elevation of privileges, and potential compromise of the application's integrity.

**Affected Pundit Component:** Policy Classes (methods within the policy classes like `show?`, `update?`, `destroy?`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement thorough unit and integration tests for all Pundit policies, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
- Conduct regular code reviews of policy logic, focusing on security implications and potential bypasses.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when designing policies, granting only necessary permissions.
- Ensure policy logic correctly handles different user roles and resource states.
- Use clear and explicit conditional statements in policies, avoiding complex or ambiguous logic.

## Threat: [Incorrect `authorize` Invocation](./threats/incorrect__authorize__invocation.md)

**Description:** A developer might forget to call the `authorize` method in a controller action or view where authorization is required. This allows an attacker to bypass Pundit's authorization checks and perform actions without proper validation. For instance, a user could directly access an edit page or trigger an update action without their permissions being verified.

**Impact:** Complete bypass of authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access and potential manipulation of data or application state.

**Affected Pundit Component:** `Pundit` module (specifically the `authorize` method in controllers and views).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement code review processes to ensure `authorize` is called in all relevant controller actions and view contexts.
- Utilize linters or static analysis tools to detect missing `authorize` calls.
- Consider using "before_action" filters in controllers to enforce authorization checks consistently.
- Implement integration tests that verify authorization is enforced for all critical actions.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Policies](./threats/overly_permissive_policies.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit overly broad or permissive policies that grant more access than intended. This allows them to perform actions on resources they should not have access to. For example, a policy might allow any logged-in user to edit any resource, rather than just their own.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of resources, access to sensitive information belonging to other users or entities, and potential disruption of application functionality.

**Affected Pundit Component:** Policy Classes (the overall logic and conditions within policy methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege when defining policy rules.
- Clearly define the scope of each policy rule and the specific conditions under which access should be granted.
- Regularly review and audit existing policies to identify and rectify overly permissive rules.
- Implement granular permission checks based on user roles, resource ownership, and other relevant attributes.

## Threat: [Data Injection/Manipulation Affecting Policy Decisions](./threats/data_injectionmanipulation_affecting_policy_decisions.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate data used within policy checks to trick Pundit into granting unauthorized access. This could involve altering user attributes, resource attributes, or request parameters that are evaluated by the policy. For example, an attacker might modify their user role (if not securely managed) or manipulate resource IDs in a request to bypass ownership checks.

**Impact:** Circumvention of authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access and actions based on manipulated data.

**Affected Pundit Component:** Policy Classes (specifically how they access and evaluate user and resource attributes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Securely manage user attributes and roles, preventing unauthorized modification.
- Validate and sanitize any user-provided data used within policy checks.
- Avoid relying solely on client-side data for authorization decisions.
- Ensure resource attributes used in policies are protected from unauthorized modification.
