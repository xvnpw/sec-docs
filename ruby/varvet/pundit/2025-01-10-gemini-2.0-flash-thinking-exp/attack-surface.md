# Attack Surface Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Attack Surface: [Policy Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/policy_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Policy Logic Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Flaws in the implementation of authorization rules within Pundit policies. This can lead to granting access to unauthorized actions or data.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit relies on developers to write correct and secure policy logic. Incorrect conditionals, missing checks, or flawed assumptions within policy methods directly create vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A policy's `update?` method might only check if the user is the owner of the record, but not if the record's status is "editable," allowing users to modify finalized records.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, access to sensitive information, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement thorough unit and integration tests specifically for Pundit policies, covering various user roles and record states.
        * Conduct code reviews of policy logic to identify potential flaws and edge cases.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when defining policy rules.
        * Clearly document the intended authorization logic for each policy.

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Incorrect Controller Authorization](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_incorrect_controller_authorization.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Missing or Incorrect Controller Authorization
    * **Description:** Failing to invoke the `authorize` method in a controller action or using it incorrectly, bypassing Pundit's intended protection.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit's effectiveness depends on its correct integration within controllers. Forgetting or misusing the `authorize` method negates its security benefits.
    * **Example:** A developer forgets to call `authorize` in the `destroy` action of a `PostsController`, allowing any authenticated user to delete any post. Alternatively, they might pass the wrong object to `authorize`, leading to incorrect policy evaluation.
    * **Impact:** Complete bypass of authorization controls, allowing unauthorized actions on resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Establish a consistent pattern for using `authorize` in controllers.
        * Utilize linters or static analysis tools to detect missing or potentially incorrect `authorize` calls.
        * Implement integration tests that verify authorization is enforced for all relevant controller actions.
        * Regularly audit controllers to ensure all actions requiring authorization are protected.

## Attack Surface: [Over-reliance on `skip_authorization`](./attack_surfaces/over-reliance_on__skip_authorization_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Over-reliance on `skip_authorization`
    * **Description:**  Overusing or misusing the `skip_authorization` method, creating unprotected endpoints without proper justification.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** While necessary in some cases, `skip_authorization` explicitly bypasses Pundit's checks. Overuse weakens the application's security posture.
    * **Example:** A developer uses `skip_authorization` for a complex action they find difficult to authorize correctly, without thoroughly analyzing the security implications.
    * **Impact:** Creation of unprotected endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the bypassed action)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Minimize the use of `skip_authorization`.
        * Thoroughly document the reasons for using `skip_authorization` and the alternative security measures in place.
        * Regularly review instances of `skip_authorization` to ensure they are still necessary and justified.
        * Consider refactoring complex actions to make them more easily authorizable.
