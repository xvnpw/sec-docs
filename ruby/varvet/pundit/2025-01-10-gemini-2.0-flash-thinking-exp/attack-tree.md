## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authorization Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authorization_checks.md)

* Attack Vector: Missing Authorization Checks (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Developers fail to include the `authorize` call before performing an action, leaving it unprotected.
    * Example: A controller action to delete a user is missing `authorize @user, :destroy?`.
* Attack Vector: Forget to Call `authorize` (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: A specific instance of missing authorization checks due to developer oversight.
    * Example: Forgetting to add `authorize` in a newly implemented feature.
* Attack Vector: Incorrect Policy Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Description: Flaws in the conditional statements within Pundit policies lead to unintended authorization outcomes.
    * Example: Using `if user.admin? or record.owner == user` when only admins should be allowed.
* Attack Vector: Flawed Conditional Logic (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Specific instances of incorrect `if/else` or boolean logic within policies.
    * Example: An `if` condition that always evaluates to true, granting access to everyone.
* Attack Vector: Relying on Mutable Data Without Safeguards (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Policies base authorization decisions on attributes that can be modified by the user before the check occurs.
    * Example: A policy checking `record.status == 'pending'` when a user can change the status to 'pending' before the check.
* Attack Vector: Incorrect Policy Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Description: Errors in setting up Pundit, leading to policies not being applied correctly or at all.
    * Example: Misconfiguring the application to look for policies in the wrong directory.
* Attack Vector: Misspelled Policy Names (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Typographical errors in policy class or method names prevent Pundit from finding the correct policy.
    * Example: Referencing `UserPolcy` instead of `UserPolicy`.
* Attack Vector: Policy Not Found/Loaded (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Policy files are missing, incorrectly named, or not loaded by the application's autoloading mechanism.
    * Example: Placing policy files in a directory that is not part of the load path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Policy Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_policy_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vector: Role Assumption Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Description: Attackers exploit weaknesses in how user roles are determined and used within policies.
    * Example: Manipulating session data to impersonate an administrator.
* Attack Vector: Manipulating User Roles (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Directly altering user role information to gain unauthorized access.
    * Example: Tampering with a cookie that stores user role information.
* Attack Vector: Privilege Escalation through Policy Flaws (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Exploiting logical errors in policies to gain higher privileges than intended.
    * Example: A policy that grants admin access based on a non-privileged user having a specific, easily attainable attribute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_issues.md)

* Attack Vector: Inconsistent Authorization Across Layers (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Description: Discrepancies in authorization enforcement between different parts of the application.
    * Example: Relying on Pundit for backend authorization but not implementing corresponding checks in the frontend, allowing users to manipulate UI elements or API calls.
* Attack Vector: Backend Authorization but Missing Frontend Enforcement (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Specifically, the backend correctly authorizes actions, but the frontend does not prevent users from attempting unauthorized actions.
    * Example: A button to delete a resource is visible to a user who is not authorized to delete it, relying solely on the backend to block the action.
* Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom Policy Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Description: Bugs or security flaws within the custom methods defined in Pundit policies.
    * Example: A custom policy method that incorrectly validates user input, leading to a bypass.
* Attack Vector: Bugs in Policy Methods (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Description: Specific errors or vulnerabilities within the code of custom policy methods.
    * Example: A custom method that uses an insecure comparison or fails to handle edge cases.
