# Threat Model Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Threat: [Policy Logic Flaw Leads to Unauthorized Access](./threats/policy_logic_flaw_leads_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a flaw in the logic of a Pundit policy to gain access to resources or perform actions they are not intended to. This might involve crafting specific requests or manipulating data in a way that bypasses the intended authorization checks within the policy's conditions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical resources, or execution of privileged actions. This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
*   **Affected Pundit Component:** Policy class methods (e.g., `show?`, `create?`, `update?`, custom action methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement thorough unit tests for all policy methods, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews of policy logic, focusing on clarity and correctness.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to identify potential logical flaws in policy definitions.
    *   Keep policy logic as simple and focused as possible to reduce the chance of errors.

## Threat: [Missing Policy Enforcement](./threats/missing_policy_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could access resources or perform actions for which no Pundit policy has been defined. Since Pundit defaults to allowing access if no policy is found, the attacker can bypass authorization checks entirely.
*   **Impact:**  Unintended access to sensitive data or functionality. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Pundit Component:**  The `authorize` method call in controllers or other parts of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that every action requiring authorization has a corresponding Pundit policy defined.
    *   Implement a "fallback" policy that explicitly denies access if no specific policy is found for a given action and resource.
    *   Use linters or static analysis tools to identify missing `authorize` calls or actions without associated policies.

## Threat: [Incorrect Resource or User Passed to `authorize`](./threats/incorrect_resource_or_user_passed_to__authorize_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit a situation where the incorrect resource or user object is passed to the `authorize` method. This could lead to authorization checks being performed against the wrong context, potentially granting unauthorized access. For example, authorizing against a different user's resource.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to resources or actions belonging to other users or entities. This could lead to data breaches, manipulation of other users' data, or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Pundit Component:** The `authorize` method call in controllers or other parts of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review all calls to the `authorize` method to ensure the correct resource and user objects are being passed.
    *   Use clear and descriptive variable names to avoid confusion.
    *   Implement integration tests that specifically verify the correct resource and user are used in authorization checks.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation Leading to Policy Bypass](./threats/data_manipulation_leading_to_policy_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate data that is used within Pundit policies to make authorization decisions. For example, if a policy checks a user's role, an attacker might attempt to modify their role information (if not properly protected) to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Circumvention of authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access to resources or actions. This could result in data breaches, privilege escalation, or manipulation of critical data.
*   **Affected Pundit Component:** Policy class methods that rely on specific data attributes of the user or resource.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid relying on client-side or easily manipulated data for authorization decisions.
    *   Fetch user roles and permissions from a trusted, server-side source.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data used in policy logic.
    *   Secure the storage and retrieval of user roles and permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
