# Attack Surface Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Attack Surface: [Policy Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/policy_logic_flaws.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insufficient authorization logic implemented within Pundit policy classes. This leads to granting unauthorized access or denying legitimate access to sensitive resources and actions.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit provides the framework for defining authorization rules in policies. The security relies entirely on the correctness and completeness of the logic implemented by developers within these policies. Flaws in this logic directly translate to security vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A policy for accessing financial reports might incorrectly grant access to any logged-in user instead of only users with the 'accountant' role due to a logical error in the `show?` method.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to highly sensitive data, modification of critical data by unauthorized users, significant privilege escalation allowing attackers to perform administrative actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rigorous testing of policy logic:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically for authorization rules, covering all possible user roles, data states, and edge cases.
        * **Principle of least privilege:** Design policies to grant the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
        * **Clear and explicit policy conditions:** Ensure policy methods are easy to understand, audit, and maintain, reducing the chance of logical errors.
        * **Security code reviews:** Mandate thorough reviews of policy code by experienced developers to identify potential flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass due to Missing `authorize` Calls](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_due_to_missing__authorize__calls.md)

* **Description:** Failing to invoke the `authorize` method in controllers or views for actions that protect sensitive resources or functionalities, completely bypassing Pundit's authorization checks.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit's security model relies on developers explicitly calling the `authorize` method to enforce authorization. If this call is absent, Pundit is not invoked, and the action proceeds without any authorization checks.
    * **Example:** A developer forgets to call `authorize @user, :destroy?` in the `destroy` action of the `UsersController`. Any authenticated user could then potentially delete any user account, including administrators.
    * **Impact:** Complete circumvention of the authorization system, leading to widespread unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential takeover of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Establish mandatory authorization checks:** Implement coding standards and guidelines that require explicit authorization for all sensitive actions.
        * **Utilize linters and static analysis tools:** Configure tools to automatically detect missing `authorize` calls in controllers and views.
        * **Comprehensive integration testing:** Implement tests that specifically verify authorization is enforced for all protected actions, ensuring unauthorized users are blocked.
        * **Thorough code reviews:** Emphasize the verification of authorization checks during code reviews.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect `authorize` Arguments (Leading to High Severity Issues)](./attack_surfaces/incorrect__authorize__arguments__leading_to_high_severity_issues_.md)

* **Description:** Passing incorrect arguments (e.g., the wrong record or user object) to the `authorize` method, leading to authorization decisions being made based on the wrong context, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit uses the provided arguments to determine which policy to invoke and what data to pass to the policy methods. Incorrect arguments will lead to the wrong policy being evaluated or the policy operating on incorrect data.
    * **Example:** In a controller action to transfer funds between accounts, the developer mistakenly calls `authorize @source_account, :withdraw?` with the `@destination_account` object instead of the `@source_account`. This could lead to a policy incorrectly allowing a withdrawal from an account the user doesn't own.
    * **Impact:** Incorrect authorization decisions leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or the ability to perform unauthorized actions with significant consequences (e.g., financial transactions, data deletion).
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Careful review of `authorize` calls:** Double-check that the correct record and user objects are being passed, especially in actions involving sensitive operations.
        * **Descriptive variable naming:** Use clear and unambiguous variable names to reduce the chance of passing the wrong object.
        * **Integration tests with varied data:** Implement tests that specifically test authorization with different data contexts to ensure correctness.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Scopes (Leading to High Severity Data Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_scopes__leading_to_high_severity_data_exposure_.md)

* **Description:** Policy scopes that do not adequately filter records based on user permissions, potentially exposing large amounts of sensitive data to unauthorized users when querying collections.
    * **How Pundit Contributes:** Pundit's `Scope` class is designed to filter collections of records based on authorization rules. If the logic within the scope is flawed or incomplete, it can return records that the user should not have access to.
    * **Example:** A scope for `MedicalRecord` objects might only filter based on the patient's consent flag but fails to restrict access based on the doctor's assigned patients. A doctor could then potentially access the medical records of all patients in the system.
    * **Impact:** Large-scale information disclosure, potential data breaches involving highly sensitive personal or confidential information.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thorough review and testing of scope logic:** Ensure that scopes correctly filter records based on the intended authorization rules, considering all relevant attributes and relationships.
        * **Principle of least privilege in scopes:** Only return the absolute minimum set of records that the user is authorized to access.
        * **Context-aware scope logic:** Ensure the scope logic takes into account the current user's roles, permissions, and relationships to the data being queried.
        * **Integration tests for scope behavior:** Implement tests that verify scopes return the expected set of records for different user roles and permissions.
