# Deep Analysis of Pundit Attack Tree Path: Bypassing Policy Checks

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Bypassing Policy Checks" attack tree path within the context of a Ruby on Rails application utilizing the Pundit authorization library.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to enhance the application's security posture.  The focus is on practical, developer-centric guidance.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Bypassing Policy Checks" path and its three identified sub-vectors:

1.  **Missing `authorize` Calls:**  Complete omission of authorization checks.
2.  **Incorrect `authorize` Placement:**  Authorization checks performed too late in the request lifecycle.
3.  **Abusing Policy Scope:**  Manipulation of input to broaden the scope of authorized data retrieval.

We will *not* analyze other potential attack vectors against Pundit (e.g., vulnerabilities within Pundit itself, which are assumed to be patched) or general application security issues unrelated to Pundit.  We assume the application is a standard Ruby on Rails application.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Description:**  Provide a detailed explanation of each sub-vector, including realistic code examples demonstrating the vulnerability.
2.  **Exploitation Scenario:**  Describe a plausible scenario where an attacker could exploit the vulnerability, outlining the steps involved.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Reiterate and expand upon the impact, likelihood, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty, providing specific justifications.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose multiple, layered mitigation strategies, prioritizing practical and effective solutions for developers.  This will include code examples, configuration changes, and process improvements.
5.  **Testing and Verification:**  Describe how to test for the presence of the vulnerability and verify the effectiveness of the mitigations.  This will include unit, integration, and potentially security testing approaches.
6. **Residual Risk:** Briefly discuss any remaining risk after implementing the mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Bypassing Policy Checks

### 2.1 Missing `authorize` Calls [CN]

**Vulnerability Description:**

This is the most straightforward vulnerability.  A developer simply forgets to include the `authorize` or `authorize!` call within a controller action (or other location where authorization is required, such as a service object or background job).  This leaves the action completely unprotected, allowing any user (authenticated or unauthenticated, depending on the application's authentication setup) to access it.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  # before_action :authenticate_user! # Assume authentication is in place

  def destroy
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    @article.destroy! # Database modification happens *before* any authorization check.
    redirect_to articles_path, notice: 'Article was successfully destroyed.'
  end
end
```

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  An unprivileged user (or even an unauthenticated user if authentication isn't enforced) knows or guesses the URL to delete an article (e.g., `/articles/123`).
2.  They directly access this URL, sending a DELETE request.
3.  The `destroy` action executes without any authorization check.
4.  The article with ID 123 is deleted from the database.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** High.  It's a common mistake, especially in larger applications or during rapid development.
*   **Impact:** Very High.  Complete bypass of authorization allows unauthorized actions, potentially leading to data loss, modification, or exposure.
*   **Effort:** Very Low.  The attacker simply needs to access the correct URL.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.  No special tools or techniques are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.  Requires careful code review or automated analysis to identify missing `authorize` calls.  Runtime errors might not occur.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Coding Standards and Code Review:**  Enforce a strict coding standard that *requires* an `authorize` call in every controller action (unless explicitly documented as intentionally public).  Mandatory code reviews should specifically check for this.
2.  **Linter/Static Analysis:**  Use a linter like RuboCop with a custom rule (or a dedicated security linter) to detect missing `authorize` calls.  This can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Example (Rubocop configuration - conceptual):

    ```yaml
    # .rubocop.yml (This is a simplified example; a real rule would be more complex)
    MyOrg/MissingAuthorize:
      Enabled: true
      Include:
        - 'app/controllers/**/*_controller.rb'
      Exclude:
        - 'app/controllers/public_controller.rb' # Example of an intentionally public controller
      Message: 'Missing authorize call in controller action.'
    ```

3.  **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests that specifically attempt to access protected actions without proper authorization.  These tests should *fail* if the `authorize` call is missing.

    ```ruby
    # test/integration/articles_test.rb
    require 'test_helper'

    class ArticlesTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
      test "unauthorized user cannot delete an article" do
        user = users(:unprivileged_user) # Assuming you have fixtures
        sign_in user
        assert_raises(Pundit::NotAuthorizedError) do
          delete article_path(articles(:one))
        end
      end
    end
    ```

4.  **Default Deny Approach:** Consider a "default deny" approach where, by default, all actions are considered protected unless explicitly marked as public. This can be achieved through careful controller inheritance and helper methods.

5. **`pundit-matchers` Gem:** Use the `pundit-matchers` gem to test your policies directly, ensuring they are correctly defined and cover all actions.

**Testing and Verification:**

*   **Unit Tests (Policy Tests):** Use `pundit-matchers` to test your policies.
*   **Integration Tests:** As shown above, attempt unauthorized access and expect `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`.
*   **Code Review:** Manually inspect code for missing `authorize` calls.
*   **Static Analysis:** Run linters and static analysis tools to automatically detect missing calls.

**Residual Risk:**

Even with these mitigations, there's a small residual risk of human error (e.g., a developer bypassing the linter or misconfiguring the integration tests).  Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Incorrect `authorize` Placement [CN]

**Vulnerability Description:**

This vulnerability occurs when the `authorize` call is present, but placed *after* code that performs a sensitive operation (e.g., database modification, sending an email, accessing an external API).  The authorization check happens too late, allowing the unauthorized action to occur before the check can prevent it.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  # before_action :authenticate_user!

  def update
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    @article.update!(article_params) # Database modification *before* authorization!
    authorize @article # Authorization check is too late.
    redirect_to @article, notice: 'Article was successfully updated.'
  end

  private

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content)
  end
end
```

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  An unprivileged user attempts to update an article they don't own.
2.  They send a PUT request to `/articles/123` with modified data.
3.  The `update` action executes.
4.  The `@article.update!` line modifies the database *before* the `authorize` call.
5.  The `authorize` call *might* raise an error, but the damage is already done – the article has been updated.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might understand the need for authorization but make mistakes in the order of operations.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Unauthorized data modification can occur, even if the user ultimately receives an error message.
*   **Effort:** Very Low.  Similar to the missing `authorize` case, the attacker simply needs to send a request.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.  Requires careful code review to identify the incorrect order of operations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **"Authorize First" Principle:**  Establish a clear principle that *all* authorization checks must happen *before* any potentially unauthorized action.  This should be emphasized in coding standards and code reviews.
2.  **Code Review:**  Code reviews should specifically look for this pattern – database operations or other sensitive actions happening before the `authorize` call.
3.  **Transaction Rollbacks (Limited Effectiveness):** While database transactions can help mitigate the impact of *some* incorrect placements (by rolling back changes if the authorization fails), they are *not* a complete solution.  They won't prevent actions like sending emails or making external API calls.  They also don't prevent information leakage (e.g., if the unauthorized action reads sensitive data before the authorization check).
4.  **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests that attempt unauthorized actions and verify that the database (or other state) is *not* modified.

    ```ruby
    # test/integration/articles_test.rb
    test "unauthorized user cannot update an article" do
      user = users(:unprivileged_user)
      sign_in user
      article = articles(:one)
      original_title = article.title

      assert_raises(Pundit::NotAuthorizedError) do
        patch article_path(article), params: { article: { title: 'New Title' } }
      end

      article.reload # Reload the article from the database
      assert_equal original_title, article.title # Verify the title hasn't changed
    end
    ```

**Testing and Verification:**

*   **Integration Tests:** As shown above, attempt unauthorized actions and verify that no changes occur.
*   **Code Review:** Manually inspect code for the correct order of operations.

**Residual Risk:**

Similar to the previous case, there's a residual risk of human error.  Careful code reviews and thorough testing are crucial.

### 2.3 Abusing Policy Scope [CN]

**Vulnerability Description:**

This vulnerability involves manipulating input parameters to influence the `policy_scope` method, causing it to return a larger set of records than intended.  This allows an attacker to potentially access data they shouldn't be able to see.  This is often related to parameter tampering.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
# app/policies/article_policy.rb
class ArticlePolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  class Scope < Scope
    def resolve
      # Vulnerable: Directly uses user-supplied params[:user_id]
      scope.where(user_id: params[:user_id])
    end
  end

  # ... other policy methods ...
end

# app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = policy_scope(Article)
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  The application displays a list of articles, potentially filtered by user ID.  The intended behavior is that a user can only see their own articles.
2.  The URL might look like `/articles?user_id=123` (where 123 is the user's ID).
3.  An attacker modifies the `user_id` parameter in the URL to a different value (e.g., `/articles?user_id=456`).
4.  The `policy_scope` method, due to the vulnerable code, uses this attacker-controlled `user_id` to query the database.
5.  The attacker now sees articles belonging to user 456, bypassing the intended authorization.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Requires understanding of how `policy_scope` works and how parameters are used.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Can lead to significant data exposure, allowing attackers to access data belonging to other users.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Requires manipulating URL parameters or request bodies.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Requires some understanding of web application security and parameter tampering.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.  Requires careful analysis of how `policy_scope` is implemented and how input parameters are used.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Never Trust User Input:**  Treat *all* user-supplied data as potentially malicious.  Do *not* directly use parameters from `params` within `policy_scope` without proper validation and sanitization.
2.  **Use Current User:**  Instead of relying on user-supplied `user_id` parameters, use the `current_user` (or equivalent) object to determine the authorized scope.

    ```ruby
    # app/policies/article_policy.rb
    class ArticlePolicy < ApplicationPolicy
      class Scope < Scope
        def resolve
          scope.where(user_id: user.id) # Use the current user's ID
        end
      end

      # ... other policy methods ...
    end
    ```

3.  **Strong Parameters:**  Use strong parameters to explicitly whitelist the allowed parameters and their types.  This helps prevent attackers from injecting unexpected parameters.

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @articles = policy_scope(Article).where(article_params)
        # ...
      end

      private
      def article_params
          params.fetch(:article, {}).permit(:published) # Example: Only allow filtering by 'published'
      end
    end
    ```
4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If you *must* use user-supplied parameters within `policy_scope` (which is generally discouraged), rigorously validate and sanitize them.  Ensure they conform to expected data types and ranges.
5.  **Avoid Direct SQL Queries:**  Whenever possible, use ActiveRecord's query methods (e.g., `where`, `joins`, `includes`) instead of constructing raw SQL queries.  ActiveRecord automatically handles SQL injection prevention.
6. **Policy Scope Tests:** Write specific tests for your policy scopes to ensure they return the correct records under various conditions, including attempts to manipulate parameters.

    ```ruby
    # test/policies/article_policy_test.rb
    require 'test_helper'

    class ArticlePolicyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
      test "policy scope returns only the user's articles" do
        user = users(:one)
        other_user = users(:two)
        article1 = articles(:one) # Belongs to user one
        article2 = articles(:two) # Belongs to user two

        scope = Pundit.policy_scope!(user, Article)
        assert_includes scope, article1
        refute_includes scope, article2
      end
    end
    ```

**Testing and Verification:**

*   **Policy Scope Tests:** As shown above, test the `policy_scope` directly with different users and parameters.
*   **Integration Tests:** Attempt to access resources with manipulated parameters and verify that unauthorized access is denied.
*   **Security Scans:** Use automated security scanners to detect potential parameter tampering vulnerabilities.

**Residual Risk:**

Even with these mitigations, there's a risk of complex logic errors within `policy_scope` that could be exploited.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended.

## 3. Conclusion

This deep analysis has explored the "Bypassing Policy Checks" attack tree path in detail, providing practical guidance for developers using Pundit. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of authorization bypass vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of their applications. The key takeaways are:

*   **Always use `authorize` (or `authorize!`)**:  Make it a non-negotiable rule in your development process.
*   **Place `authorize` calls correctly**:  Authorization *must* happen before any sensitive operation.
*   **Never trust user input in `policy_scope`**:  Use the `current_user` object and strong parameters.
*   **Test thoroughly**:  Use a combination of unit, integration, and security tests to verify your authorization logic.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Conduct these to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

By following these guidelines, developers can build more secure and robust applications that effectively leverage the power of Pundit for authorization.
