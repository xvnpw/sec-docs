# Deep Analysis: Incorrect Scope Resolution in Pundit

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Incorrect Scope Resolution" vulnerability within applications using the Pundit authorization library.  This includes identifying the root causes, potential exploitation scenarios, and robust mitigation strategies to prevent information disclosure.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their applications against this specific threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on vulnerabilities arising from incorrect implementation or misuse of Pundit's `Policy::Scope` classes.  It covers:

*   The intended functionality of `Policy::Scope`.
*   Common mistakes leading to incorrect scope resolution.
*   The impact of these mistakes on application security.
*   Specific testing and code review techniques to identify and prevent these vulnerabilities.
*   Database query analysis as a verification method.
*   Relationship with other attack vectors.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General Pundit configuration issues outside of `Policy::Scope`.
*   Authorization bypasses unrelated to scope resolution.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying database or ORM (e.g., SQL injection).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Conceptual Understanding:**  We begin by establishing a clear understanding of Pundit's `Policy::Scope` mechanism and its role in authorization.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** We identify common patterns and anti-patterns in `Policy::Scope` implementations that lead to information disclosure.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Analysis:** We construct realistic scenarios where incorrect scope resolution can be exploited by malicious actors.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We propose concrete and actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples, testing approaches, and review guidelines.
5.  **Database Query Analysis:** We emphasize the importance of examining generated SQL queries to confirm the correctness of scope resolution.
6.  **Relationship with other attack vectors:** We will check how this attack surface can be related to other attack vectors.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Understanding `Policy::Scope`

Pundit's `Policy::Scope` classes are a *critical* component of its authorization model.  They are designed to handle the authorization of *collections* of records (e.g., a list of posts, a set of users).  The `resolve` method within a `Scope` class is responsible for returning the subset of records that the current user is permitted to access.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Least Privilege:** The `resolve` method should *only* return records that the user has explicit permission to view or interact with.
*   **Context Awareness:** The filtering logic within `resolve` should consider the user's role, attributes, and any relevant contextual information (e.g., ownership, group membership).
*   **Efficiency:** While security is paramount, the `resolve` method should also be efficient, avoiding unnecessary database queries or complex calculations.

### 4.2. Common Mistakes and Vulnerabilities

The following are common mistakes that lead to incorrect scope resolution and information disclosure:

1.  **Returning `scope.all` (or equivalent):** This is the most egregious error, as it completely bypasses any authorization checks and returns *all* records in the collection, regardless of user permissions.  This is the example provided in the original attack surface description.

    ```ruby
    class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
      class Scope < Scope
        def resolve
          scope.all  # **INCORRECT - MAJOR VULNERABILITY**
        end
      end
    end
    ```

2.  **Incorrect Conditional Logic:**  Errors in the conditional logic used to filter records can lead to unintended exposure.  This often involves:

    *   **Missing Conditions:**  Failing to check for specific user roles or attributes.
    *   **Incorrect Operators:** Using `||` (OR) when `&&` (AND) is required, or vice-versa.
    *   **Off-by-One Errors:**  Incorrectly handling boundary conditions (e.g., allowing access to one extra record).
    *   **Neglecting Context:**  Failing to consider relevant contextual information (e.g., relationships between records).

    ```ruby
    class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
      class Scope < Scope
        def resolve
          if user.admin? || user.editor? # Missing a check for author!
            scope.all
          else
            scope.where(published: true) # Authors should see their unpublished posts too!
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

3.  **Ignoring Relationships:**  Failing to properly account for relationships between models can lead to information disclosure.  For example, a user might be able to access comments on a post they shouldn't be able to see.

    ```ruby
    class CommentPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
      class Scope < Scope
        def resolve
          scope.all # Incorrect! Should only return comments on posts the user can see.
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    A correct implementation would likely involve joining with the `posts` table and using the `PostPolicy::Scope` to filter the results.

4.  **Overly Permissive Default:**  If no specific conditions are met, the `resolve` method might default to a scope that is too broad.  It's generally safer to default to an *empty* scope (e.g., `scope.none` in Rails) and explicitly add records based on permissions.

5.  **Using `unscoped` (Rails):**  The `unscoped` method in ActiveRecord removes *all* scoping, including default scopes defined on the model.  This can inadvertently expose data that should be protected.  Use `unscoped` with extreme caution, and only when absolutely necessary.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

1.  **Data Leakage to Unauthorized Users:** A user without the necessary permissions could access a list of all users, including their email addresses, roles, and potentially other sensitive information.  This could be exploited for phishing attacks, social engineering, or account takeover.

2.  **Exposure of Confidential Documents:**  If a `DocumentPolicy::Scope` incorrectly returns all documents, a user could access confidential files, contracts, or internal reports.

3.  **Bypassing Business Logic:**  Incorrect scope resolution could allow users to bypass intended workflows or business rules.  For example, a user might be able to view or modify orders that they shouldn't have access to.

4.  **Enumeration Attacks:** Even if the directly exposed data isn't highly sensitive, an attacker might be able to use the incorrect scope resolution to enumerate resources and gain information about the system's structure or data.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:** This is the *most* important mitigation strategy.  Write thorough tests for *every* `Policy::Scope` class, covering all possible user roles, contexts, and edge cases.

    *   **Test Different User Roles:** Create test users with various roles (e.g., admin, editor, regular user, guest) and verify that the `resolve` method returns the correct records for each role.
    *   **Test Contextual Variations:**  If the scope depends on contextual information (e.g., ownership, relationships), create test data that reflects these variations and verify the results.
    *   **Test Edge Cases:**  Test boundary conditions, empty collections, and unusual scenarios to ensure the scope behaves correctly.
    *   **Use Factories/Fixtures:**  Use tools like FactoryBot or fixtures to create realistic test data efficiently.
    *   **Assertion Examples:**

        ```ruby
        # spec/policies/post_policy_spec.rb
        require 'rails_helper'

        RSpec.describe PostPolicy::Scope do
          let(:user) { create(:user) }
          let(:admin) { create(:admin) }
          let(:published_post) { create(:post, published: true) }
          let(:unpublished_post) { create(:post, published: false, user: user) }
          let(:other_unpublished_post) { create(:post, published: false) }

          it "returns only published posts for regular users" do
            scope = PostPolicy::Scope.new(user, Post).resolve
            expect(scope).to include(published_post)
            expect(scope).not_to include(unpublished_post)
            expect(scope).not_to include(other_unpublished_post)
          end

          it "returns all posts for admins" do
            scope = PostPolicy::Scope.new(admin, Post).resolve
            expect(scope).to include(published_post, unpublished_post, other_unpublished_post)
          end

          it "returns published and own unpublished posts for authors" do
            scope = PostPolicy::Scope.new(user, Post).resolve
            expect(scope).to include(published_post, unpublished_post)
            expect(scope).not_to include(other_unpublished_post)
          end
        end
        ```

2.  **Rigorous Code Reviews:**  Code reviews should specifically focus on the `resolve` method of each `Policy::Scope` class.  Reviewers should:

    *   **Understand the Intended Scope:**  Ensure the reviewer understands the business rules and authorization requirements for the collection.
    *   **Scrutinize Filtering Logic:**  Carefully examine the conditional logic and ensure it correctly implements the intended scope.
    *   **Look for Common Mistakes:**  Be vigilant for the common mistakes listed in section 4.2.
    *   **Consider Edge Cases:**  Discuss potential edge cases and ensure they are handled correctly.
    *   **Question `scope.all`:**  Any instance of `scope.all` should be heavily scrutinized and justified.

3.  **Database Query Analysis:**  Examine the SQL queries generated by the `resolve` method to confirm that they are correct and efficient.

    *   **Enable Query Logging:**  Configure your development environment to log SQL queries.
    *   **Use Query Profiling Tools:**  Use tools like the `rack-mini-profiler` gem to analyze query performance and identify potential issues.
    *   **Verify `WHERE` Clauses:**  Ensure the `WHERE` clauses in the generated SQL queries correctly restrict access based on user permissions.
    *   **Look for Unnecessary Joins:**  Avoid unnecessary joins, as they can impact performance and potentially expose data.

4.  **Default to `scope.none`:**  Start with an empty scope (`scope.none` in Rails) and explicitly add records based on permissions.  This is a safer approach than starting with `scope.all` and trying to filter out unauthorized records.

    ```ruby
    class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
      class Scope < Scope
        def resolve
          resolved_scope = scope.none # Start with an empty scope

          if user.admin?
            resolved_scope = scope.all # Admins can see all posts
          elsif user
            resolved_scope = scope.where(published: true).or(scope.where(user: user)) # Published posts or own posts
          end

          resolved_scope
        end
      end
    end
    ```

5.  **Leverage Pundit's `policy_scope` Helper:** Use the `policy_scope` helper method in your controllers to consistently apply the correct scope.

    ```ruby
    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @posts = policy_scope(Post) # Applies PostPolicy::Scope
      end
    end
    ```

6. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including incorrect scope resolution.

### 4.5 Relationship with other attack vectors

Incorrect Scope Resolution can be related to other attack vectors:

1.  **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** While distinct, Incorrect Scope Resolution can *exacerbate* IDOR vulnerabilities. If an attacker can guess or manipulate an ID, and the scope resolution is flawed, they might gain access to data they shouldn't.  Proper scope resolution acts as a second layer of defense against IDOR.

2.  **Mass Assignment:** If mass assignment vulnerabilities exist, and scope resolution is incorrect, an attacker might be able to modify attributes of records they shouldn't even be able to see, let alone modify.

3.  **SQL Injection:** Although Pundit itself doesn't directly prevent SQL injection, incorrect scope resolution can make the impact of a successful SQL injection attack much worse.  If an attacker can inject SQL to bypass authentication, flawed scope resolution might grant them access to *all* data, rather than just the data associated with a single user.

4. **Broken Access Control:** Incorrect Scope Resolution is a *specific type* of broken access control. It highlights the importance of granular, context-aware authorization checks.

## 5. Conclusion

Incorrect scope resolution in Pundit is a high-severity vulnerability that can lead to significant information disclosure.  By understanding the intended functionality of `Policy::Scope`, recognizing common mistakes, and implementing robust mitigation strategies (especially comprehensive testing and code reviews), developers can effectively protect their applications from this threat.  Regular security audits and database query analysis provide additional layers of defense, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data. The relationship with other attack vectors highlights the importance of a defense-in-depth approach to application security.
