## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Policy Logic [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_policy_logic__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The policy itself contains flaws that allow unauthorized access, even when Pundit is technically used correctly. This is a high-risk path because it represents a fundamental error in the authorization logic.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Scope Resolution [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** The `policy_scope` method (used for scoping collections of resources) is either missing or returns an overly permissive scope. This is a critical node due to its high likelihood and potential for significant data exposure.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure every policy has a well-defined `policy_scope` method. Thoroughly test the scope resolution to ensure it only returns authorized records. Use test cases that cover edge cases.
    *   **Flawed Scope Implementation:**
        *   **Description:** The logic within `policy_scope` is incorrect (e.g., incorrect database query, misinterpretation of user roles).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Review the SQL/ActiveRecord queries within `policy_scope` for correctness. Use a debugger to step through the logic. Write unit tests specifically for `policy_scope`.
    *   **Incorrect Conditional Logic:**
        *   **Description:** Policy methods (e.g., `show?`, `create?`) contain incorrect conditional logic (wrong attributes, incorrect boolean operators, failure to handle edge cases).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Carefully review the logic within each policy method. Write comprehensive unit tests for *each* policy method, covering all code paths and edge cases. Use a code coverage tool.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Policy Checks [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_policy_checks__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to execute actions *without* triggering Pundit's authorization checks. This is a high-risk path because it represents a complete bypass of the intended security mechanism.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Missing `authorize` Calls [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** The developer forgets to call `authorize` (or `authorize!`) in a controller action or other relevant location. This is the *most critical* node due to its high likelihood, very high impact, and ease of exploitation.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Establish a coding standard requiring `authorize` calls. Use code review and potentially linters/static analysis tools. Implement integration tests.
    *   **Incorrect `authorize` Placement [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** `authorize` is called, but in the wrong place (e.g., *after* a database modification). This is a critical node because it can lead to unauthorized actions before authorization is checked.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure `authorize` is called *before* any potentially unauthorized action. Use code review and testing.
    *   **Abusing Policy Scope [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates input parameters to influence the `policy_scope` to return more records than intended (parameter tampering). This is a critical node due to its potential for significant data exposure and relative difficulty of detection.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize all input parameters used within `policy_scope`. Avoid directly using user-supplied data in database queries without proper escaping. Use strong parameters.
