# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for varvet/pundit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Test Coverage for Policies](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_test_coverage_for_policies.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Policies and Actions:** List all Pundit policies and the actions (methods) within each policy that control access (e.g., `show?`, `create?`, `update?`, `destroy?`, `policy_scope`).
2.  **Define Test Cases:** For each action, define multiple test cases, including positive (allowed), negative (denied), edge cases, and different user roles/permissions.  Test all branches of conditional logic *within* the Pundit policies.
3.  **Write Tests:** Use a testing framework (e.g., RSpec, Minitest) to write tests that:
    *   Create mock users with specific roles and attributes.
    *   Create mock resources (if necessary).
    *   Call the Pundit policy action (e.g., `policy.show?`) with the mock user and resource.
    *   Assert that the policy returns the expected boolean result (`true` or `false`).
    *   Specifically test `policy_scope` to ensure it correctly filters records based on user permissions.
4.  **Automate Tests:** Integrate the tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
5.  **Regularly Review and Update Tests:** Update tests whenever policies change.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Incorrect Policy Logic (Critical):** Flawed conditional statements within Pundit policies, incorrect use of Pundit helpers, misunderstandings of authorization requirements.
*   **Data Leakage (High):** Incorrect `policy_scope` logic in Pundit exposing unauthorized data.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High):** A user gaining access via a Pundit policy to actions or resources they shouldn't have.
*   **Broken Access Control (High):** General failure of the Pundit-based authorization system.

**Impact:**
*   **Incorrect Policy Logic:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (60-80%) if `policy_scope` is thoroughly tested.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).
*   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic tests exist for `ArticlePolicy` covering `create?` and `update?`.
*   Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No tests for `CommentPolicy`.
*   Incomplete coverage for `ArticlePolicy` (missing edge cases, roles, `policy_scope`).
*   Tests are not regularly reviewed/updated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews with Authorization (Pundit) Focus](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_with_authorization__pundit__focus.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mandatory Reviews:** Require code reviews for *all* changes to Pundit policies.
2.  **Pundit-Specific Checklist:** Create a checklist for reviewing Pundit policies, including:
    *   Does the Pundit policy logic *exactly* match the authorization requirements?
    *   Are all conditions checked before granting access within the Pundit policy?
    *   Is the `policy_scope` logic (if used) correct, efficient, and secure within the Pundit policy?
    *   Are there any potential bypasses of the Pundit policy?
    *   Are there sufficient Pundit-specific tests?
3.  **Focus on Pundit Logic:** Reviewers should focus on the *logic* of the Pundit policy methods, questioning every conditional.
4.  **Document Review:** Document findings and concerns.
5.  **Approval:** Require approval before merging.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Incorrect Policy Logic (Critical):** Catches errors in Pundit policy logic.
*   **Data Leakage (High):** Identifies flaws in Pundit's `policy_scope`.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Identifies ways a user could bypass Pundit policies.
*   **Broken Access Control (High):** Reduces risk of Pundit-based authorization failures.

**Impact:**
*   **Incorrect Policy Logic:** Risk reduced significantly (50-70%).
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (50-70%).
*   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   General code reviews are required.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No Pundit-specific checklist or focus.
*   Reviews often don't thoroughly examine Pundit policy logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce `authorize` and `policy_scope` Calls (Pundit-Specific Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce__authorize__and__policy_scope__calls__pundit-specific_enforcement_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Authorization Points:** Determine where Pundit's `authorize` and `policy_scope` *must* be called (controllers, services, etc.).
2.  **Centralized Pundit Helper (Recommended):** Create a helper method (e.g., `ensure_authorized_with_pundit`) that wraps Pundit's `authorize` call.  This enforces consistent Pundit usage.  Do the same for `policy_scope` if appropriate.
3.  **Static Analysis (Pundit-Aware):** Use a linter or static analysis tool configured to detect missing calls to Pundit's `authorize` or `policy_scope` (or the custom helper) in the identified locations. This requires a tool that understands Pundit or can be configured with custom rules.
4.  **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate the static analysis into the CI/CD pipeline; violations fail the build.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Bypassing Pundit (High):** Prevents accidentally omitting Pundit authorization checks.
*   **Broken Access Control (High):** Ensures consistent application of Pundit policies.

**Impact:**
*   **Bypassing Pundit:** Risk reduced significantly (80-95%).
*   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `authorize` is called in some controller actions.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No centralized Pundit authorization helper.
*   No Pundit-aware static analysis tool.
*   No CI/CD integration for Pundit enforcement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Direct `params` Access within Pundit Policies](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_direct__params__access_within_pundit_policies.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Policy Inputs:** Determine the data *needed* by each Pundit policy method.
2.  **Pass Data as Arguments:** Modify Pundit policy methods to accept data as explicit arguments, *not* by accessing `params` directly within the Pundit policy.
3.  **Refactor Existing Policies:** Review and refactor any Pundit policies that directly access `params`.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (High):** Prevents attackers from injecting data through `params` to manipulate Pundit's authorization logic.  This is a *direct* threat to Pundit if `params` are used unsafely within a policy.
*   **Broken Access Control (High):** By controlling the data used in Pundit's authorization, this reduces the risk of incorrect access.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (80-95%) *within the context of Pundit policies*.
*   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None (for the sake of this example).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   All policies that need external data access `params` directly.
*   No refactoring has been done.
