## Threat Model: Pundit Authorization Bypass - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application authorization by exploiting weaknesses in Pundit.

**Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they are not permitted to.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

        * Policy Not Applied Consistently Across the Application **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Policy Not Applied Consistently Across the Application **[CRITICAL]**
        * Overly Permissive Default Policies **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Default `true` or insufficiently restrictive fallback rules. **[CRITICAL]**

        * User Impersonation/Privilege Escalation **[CRITICAL]**
            * Compromise Credentials of a Higher-Privilege User **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * Record Manipulation **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * Circumvent Pundit Usage **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]**
        * Missing Authorization Checks **[CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK PATH]**

            * Conditional Logic Bypassing `authorize` **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Root: Compromise Application Authorization via Pundit [CRITICAL]**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a critical failure of the application's security.

* **Exploit Policy Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * Policies are Ruby code, and like any code, they can contain bugs. Attackers can analyze policy definitions to identify logical flaws that allow unauthorized access.
        * **Incorrect Policy Logic [CRITICAL]**
            * Policies might contain flawed conditional statements, missing authorization checks, or be susceptible to type confusion, leading to unintended access being granted.
                * **Flawed Conditional Statements [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * Using incorrect boolean operators or flawed logic in `if` statements can lead to policies granting access when they shouldn't.
        * **Policy Not Applied Consistently Across the Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * If policies are not applied consistently across the application, attackers can bypass Pundit entirely in those areas.
                * **Policy Not Applied Consistently Across the Application [CRITICAL]**
                    * This creates significant vulnerabilities as certain parts of the application become unprotected.
        * **Overly Permissive Default Policies [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * If base policies or fallback rules are too permissive (e.g., always returning `true` unless explicitly denied), it can inadvertently grant broad access.
                * **Default `true` or insufficiently restrictive fallback rules. [CRITICAL]**
                    * This represents a significant security weakness as it defaults to allowing access.

* **Manipulate Data Passed to Pundit [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * If an attacker can manipulate the data that Pundit uses for authorization, they can potentially bypass the intended checks.
        * **User Impersonation/Privilege Escalation [CRITICAL]**
            * If an attacker can manipulate the user object that Pundit uses for authorization, they can potentially impersonate another user or elevate their privileges.
                * **Compromise Credentials of a Higher-Privilege User [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * A common attack vector, but relevant here as it allows bypassing Pundit's intended authorization by using legitimate credentials of a privileged user.
        * **Record Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Pundit often authorizes actions based on the attributes of the resource being accessed. If an attacker can modify these attributes before the authorization check, they might be able to bypass the policy.

* **Circumvent Pundit Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]**
    * The most straightforward way to bypass Pundit is if developers simply forget to use the `authorize` method or introduce flawed bypass logic.
        * **Missing Authorization Checks [CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * If developers forget to use the `authorize` method in their controllers or services, it completely bypasses Pundit's protection.
                * **Developers Forget to Use `authorize` [CRITICAL]**
                    * This is a common oversight and a critical vulnerability.
        * **Bypassing Authorization in Specific Scenarios**
            * Developers might introduce conditional logic that bypasses Pundit under certain circumstances, which can be exploited if the conditions are flawed.
                * **Conditional Logic Bypassing `authorize` [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * Using `if` statements to bypass authorization based on user roles or other conditions can introduce vulnerabilities if the conditions are not properly secured or if there are logical flaws in the bypass logic.
