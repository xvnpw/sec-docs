## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Pundit Policies](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_pundit_policies.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege in Pundit Policies

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Policy Review Focused on Permissions:** Examine all Pundit policies, specifically focusing on the permissions granted by each policy rule.
    2.  **Minimize Policy Scope:**  Refine policies to grant the narrowest possible permissions necessary for each role or user to perform their intended actions within the Pundit framework.
    3.  **Explicit Deny as Default in Pundit:** Ensure policies are structured to explicitly deny access unless a specific rule explicitly grants it within the Pundit policy definition.
    4.  **Pundit Policy Audits for Privilege Creep:** Regularly audit Pundit policies to identify and rectify any instances where policies have become overly permissive over time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Pundit (High Severity):** Overly broad Pundit policies can inadvertently grant unauthorized access through the Pundit authorization mechanism.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through Policy Flaws (High Severity):**  Loosely defined Pundit policies can be exploited to escalate privileges within the application's authorization context managed by Pundit.
    *   **Data Breach via Policy Misconfiguration (High Severity):**  Misconfigured Pundit policies granting excessive access can contribute to data breaches by allowing unauthorized data access through Pundit-controlled actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Pundit (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by tightly controlling permissions within Pundit policies.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through Policy Flaws (High Impact):** Makes privilege escalation attempts via Pundit policy manipulation more difficult by minimizing granted privileges.
    *   **Data Breach via Policy Misconfiguration (High Impact):** Reduces the potential scope of data breaches by limiting access granted through Pundit policies.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `app/policies`. Role-based policies exist, but the granularity and strictness of permissions within Pundit policies need review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review of all Pundit policies for least privilege. Establish guidelines for writing Pundit policies with minimal necessary permissions.

    *   **Delayed Incident Response to Pundit-Blocked Actions (Medium Impact):** Enables faster incident response to potential security incidents involving Pundit authorization.
    *   **Limited Audit Trail for Pundit Authorization (Medium Impact):** Provides a valuable audit trail for Pundit authorization decisions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** General application logging is in place, but specific logging of Pundit authorization failures with detailed context might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement dedicated logging for `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` exceptions. Configure logging to capture relevant context for Pundit authorization failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Exposing Pundit Policy Logic in Error Messages](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_exposing_pundit_policy_logic_in_error_messages.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Avoid Exposing Pundit Policy Logic in Error Messages

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generic Error Messages for Pundit Failures:** Ensure error messages related to Pundit authorization failures are generic and do not reveal specific details of Pundit policy logic.
    2.  **Abstract Pundit Authorization Errors:** Abstract away the internal details of Pundit authorization decisions in error responses to prevent information leakage.
    3.  **Security Review of Pundit Error Responses:** Review error responses related to Pundit authorization to ensure they do not inadvertently expose policy logic or sensitive application details.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure of Pundit Policy Logic (Medium Severity):** Exposing Pundit policy logic in error messages can provide attackers with information to exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Surface Increase via Pundit Error Details (Medium Severity):**  Detailed Pundit error messages can increase the attack surface by revealing internal application details.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure of Pundit Policy Logic (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by preventing exposure of Pundit policy logic in error messages.
    *   **Attack Surface Increase via Pundit Error Details (Medium Impact):** Decreases the attack surface by limiting information revealed in Pundit error responses.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Error messages are generally user-friendly, but a specific review to ensure Pundit policy logic is not exposed in error messages might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review all error responses related to Pundit authorization. Ensure error messages are generic and do not expose Pundit policy logic or internal details.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Pundit Policy Query Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_pundit_policy_query_performance.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Optimize Pundit Policy Query Performance

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Performance Profiling of Pundit Policies:** Profile the performance of Pundit policies, especially those involving database queries.
    2.  **Database Optimization for Pundit Queries:** Optimize database queries within Pundit policies to ensure they are efficient and do not cause performance bottlenecks. Use indexes and efficient query patterns.
    3.  **Caching Strategies for Pundit Policy Data:** Implement caching strategies for data used in Pundit policies to reduce database load and improve performance, where appropriate.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service via Slow Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):** Inefficient database queries in Pundit policies can contribute to denial-of-service vulnerabilities if authorization checks become slow.
    *   **Performance Degradation due to Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**  Slow Pundit policies can degrade overall application performance and user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service via Slow Pundit Policies (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of denial-of-service vulnerabilities caused by slow Pundit policies.
    *   **Performance Degradation due to Pundit Policies (Medium Impact):** Improves application performance by optimizing Pundit policy execution.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Database optimization is generally practiced, but specific performance profiling and optimization of Pundit policy queries might not be regularly performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement performance profiling for Pundit policies. Identify and optimize slow queries within Pundit policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cache Pundit Policy Results (Where Appropriate)](./mitigation_strategies/cache_pundit_policy_results__where_appropriate_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Cache Pundit Policy Results (Where Appropriate)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Cacheable Pundit Policy Decisions:** Identify Pundit policy decisions that are computationally expensive or involve frequent database lookups and are suitable for caching.
    2.  **Implement Caching for Pundit Policy Results:** Implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse Pundit policy results for identified cacheable decisions.
    3.  **Cache Invalidation Strategy for Pundit Policies:** Develop a cache invalidation strategy to ensure cached Pundit authorization decisions remain consistent with changes in user roles, permissions, or relevant data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Bottlenecks in Pundit Authorization (Medium Severity):**  Repeatedly executing expensive Pundit policies can create performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Pundit Policies (Medium Severity):**  Inefficient Pundit policies can lead to resource exhaustion, especially under high load.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Bottlenecks in Pundit Authorization (Medium Impact):** Reduces performance bottlenecks caused by repeated execution of expensive Pundit policies.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Pundit Policies (Medium Impact):** Prevents resource exhaustion by caching and reusing Pundit policy results.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Caching is used in various parts of the application, but specific caching of Pundit policy results might not be implemented or consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Identify suitable Pundit policy decisions for caching. Implement caching mechanisms for Pundit policy results with appropriate invalidation strategies.
