# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_mandatory_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **GitLab Administrator Access:** Log in to GitLab as an administrator.
    2.  **Navigate to Admin Area:** Click on the "Menu" icon (usually top left) and select "Admin."
    3.  **Access Settings:** In the Admin Area, navigate to "Settings" -> "General."
    4.  **Sign-in Restrictions:** Expand the "Sign-in restrictions" section.
    5.  **Enable MFA Requirement:** Check the box labeled "Require all users to set up Two-Factor Authentication."
    6.  **Set Grace Period (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider setting a "Two-factor authentication grace period (days)" to allow users time to set up MFA before it's strictly enforced. A grace period of 7 days is a common starting point.
    7.  **Save Changes:** Click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page.
    8.  **User Communication:**  Communicate the MFA requirement to all GitLab users, providing instructions on how to enable MFA (e.g., using authenticator apps, SMS, or hardware keys).
    9.  **Monitoring and Enforcement:** Monitor user MFA enrollment and follow up with users who haven't enabled it after the grace period (if set).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Compromised usernames and passwords (due to phishing, password reuse, or data breaches) can be used to gain unauthorized access to GitLab accounts.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Automated attempts to guess user passwords become significantly less effective as MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** High reduction. MFA drastically reduces the risk of account takeover, even if passwords are compromised, as attackers would also need access to the user's second factor (e.g., phone, hardware key).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium reduction. While brute-force attacks might still be attempted, MFA makes them significantly more difficult and time-consuming, making them less likely to succeed.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented

*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not currently enforced for any users within the GitLab instance used by the project. This applies to all user roles: developers, project managers, administrators, etc.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Runner Configuration and Isolation (Using Docker)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_runner_configuration_and_isolation__using_docker_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Runner Installation (Docker Executor):** When installing GitLab Runner, choose the Docker executor. This is often the default and recommended for isolation.
    2.  **Runner Configuration (`config.toml`):**  Review the runner's `config.toml` file (typically located in `/etc/gitlab-runner/` or `.gitlab-runner/` in the runner's home directory).
    3.  **Executor Setting:** Ensure the `executor` is set to `docker`.
    4.  **`privileged` Mode Avoidance:**  **Crucially**, ensure `privileged = false` under the `[runners.docker]` section.  Avoid setting `privileged = true` unless absolutely necessary and with full understanding of the security implications. Privileged mode bypasses container isolation and can allow container escapes.
    5.  **`volumes` Restriction:**  Carefully review and restrict the `volumes` configuration under `[runners.docker]`. Avoid mounting the host's root directory (`/`) or sensitive directories into the container unless absolutely necessary.  Mount only specific, required directories and make them read-only where possible. For example, instead of mounting `/`, mount specific project directories like `./project:/builds/project:ro`.
    6.  **`docker_pull_policy`:** Set `docker_pull_policy = ["if-not-present", "always"]` to ensure images are pulled regularly, including security updates.
    7.  **Resource Limits (Optional but Recommended):** Consider setting resource limits for runners in `config.toml` (e.g., `cpu_limit`, `memory_limit`) to prevent resource exhaustion by malicious or poorly written pipeline jobs.
    8.  **Runner User:** Ensure the runner process is running as a non-root user. This is often the default, but verify the runner service configuration.
    9.  **Regular Updates:** Keep the GitLab Runner software and the underlying Docker engine updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape/Host System Compromise (High Severity):**  If runners are misconfigured (especially with `privileged: true` or excessive volume mounts), malicious code in a pipeline job could potentially escape the container and compromise the runner host system or other containers on the same host.
    *   **Job Interference (Medium Severity):** Insecure runner configurations could allow jobs to interfere with each other, potentially leading to data leaks or denial of service within the CI/CD environment.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Malicious or poorly written jobs could consume excessive resources on the runner, impacting the performance and availability of the CI/CD pipeline for other projects.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Escape/Host System Compromise:** High reduction. Proper Docker executor configuration with `privileged: false` and restricted volumes significantly reduces the risk of container escapes and host system compromise.
    *   **Job Interference:** Medium reduction. Container isolation and resource limits help to prevent jobs from interfering with each other.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction. Resource limits can mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion, although they may not completely prevent it in all scenarios.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Docker executor is used, but configuration review is needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A detailed review of the `config.toml` file for all GitLab Runners used by the project is needed to verify `privileged = false`, restrictive `volumes` configuration, and potentially implement resource limits.  Runner user verification is also needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CI/CD Variable Management (Using Masked Variables and Secret Management)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cicd_variable_management__using_masked_variables_and_secret_management_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets:** Identify all sensitive information used in CI/CD pipelines, such as API keys, database credentials, private keys, and tokens.
    2.  **Avoid Hardcoding in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**  **Never** hardcode secrets directly in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. This makes them visible in the repository history and accessible to anyone with repository access.
    3.  **Utilize GitLab CI/CD Variables:** Use GitLab CI/CD variables to store secrets. Navigate to Project Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables.
    4.  **Masked Variables:** For sensitive variables, enable the "Masked" option when creating or editing the variable. Masked variables will be obfuscated in job logs, preventing accidental exposure.
    5.  **Environment Scoped Variables (Optional but Recommended):**  Use environment scopes (e.g., `production`, `staging`) to restrict variable availability to specific environments. This limits the exposure of production secrets to non-production pipelines.
    6.  **External Secret Management (Advanced):** For highly sensitive secrets or enterprise-level security, integrate with external secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. GitLab provides integrations for these. Configure pipelines to retrieve secrets from these external vaults at runtime instead of storing them directly in GitLab.
    7.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Variables:** Grant access to variables only to the projects and environments that truly need them. Utilize project and group-level variables appropriately.
    8.  **Regular Review and Rotation:** Regularly review the list of CI/CD variables and rotate secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) periodically according to security policies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Repository History (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in `.gitlab-ci.yml` exposes them in the repository's version history, making them accessible to anyone with access to the repository, even after the secret is removed from the current file.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Job Logs (Medium Severity):**  Secrets printed to job logs (even accidentally) can be captured and potentially exploited.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Medium Severity):**  If secrets are not properly managed and access is not restricted, unauthorized users or processes might gain access to sensitive credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Repository History:** High reduction. Using CI/CD variables and avoiding hardcoding completely eliminates the risk of secrets being permanently stored in the repository history.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Job Logs:** Medium reduction. Masked variables significantly reduce the risk of accidental secret exposure in job logs by obfuscating them. However, developers should still be cautious about logging sensitive information.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Medium reduction. Environment scopes and project/group-level variables help to restrict access to secrets, but robust access control and secret management practices are still essential. External secret management provides the highest level of control.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. GitLab CI/CD variables are used, and some variables are masked.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A comprehensive review of all CI/CD pipelines is needed to ensure no secrets are hardcoded in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.  Implementation of environment-scoped variables and exploration of external secret management solutions for highly sensitive secrets should be considered. Regular secret rotation policy is not formally defined or implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in CI/CD Pipeline](./mitigation_strategies/implement_static_application_security_testing__sast__in_cicd_pipeline.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable GitLab SAST:** GitLab provides built-in SAST functionality. Enable it by including the SAST template in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This is typically done by including a line like `include: template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    2.  **Configure SAST (Optional):**  Customize SAST settings if needed. This can include:
        *   **Selecting Analyzers:** GitLab SAST uses various analyzers for different languages and frameworks. You can configure which analyzers to use.
        *   **Excluding Paths/Files:** Exclude specific directories or files from SAST scans if they are not relevant or cause false positives.
        *   **Custom Rules (Advanced):**  For advanced users, custom rules can be defined for specific security checks.
    3.  **Pipeline Integration:** Ensure the SAST job is included in your CI/CD pipeline stages, typically in a stage like `test` or `security`.
    4.  **Vulnerability Reporting:** GitLab SAST will automatically generate vulnerability reports within the GitLab Security Dashboard and merge requests.
    5.  **Vulnerability Review and Remediation:** Establish a process for reviewing SAST findings. Developers should investigate reported vulnerabilities, prioritize them based on severity, and remediate them.
    6.  **Pipeline Failure on High Severity Vulnerabilities (Optional but Recommended):** Configure the pipeline to fail if SAST detects vulnerabilities above a certain severity threshold (e.g., High or Critical). This enforces security checks before code is merged or deployed.
    7.  **Regular Updates:** Keep GitLab and SAST analyzers updated to benefit from the latest vulnerability detection rules and improvements.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Software Vulnerabilities (High to Medium Severity):** SAST helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, such as:
        *   **Injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection):** SAST tools can detect patterns in code that are susceptible to injection attacks.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization flaws:** SAST can identify potential weaknesses in authentication and authorization logic.
        *   **Configuration errors:** SAST can detect misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Other common coding errors:** Buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, etc.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Software Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High reduction. SAST proactively identifies vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, allowing developers to fix them before they reach production. The impact depends on the effectiveness of the SAST tools and the diligence in reviewing and remediating findings.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented

*   **Missing Implementation:** SAST is not currently enabled in the project's CI/CD pipeline. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file does not include the SAST template.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular GitLab Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_gitlab_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Announcements:** Subscribe to GitLab's security mailing lists and monitor their security release blog posts to stay informed about security vulnerabilities and updates.
    2.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a schedule for regularly updating the GitLab instance. This should be based on your organization's risk tolerance and change management policies, but security updates should be prioritized and applied promptly.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging Environment:** Before applying updates to the production GitLab instance, thoroughly test them in a staging or pre-production environment that mirrors the production setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues or regressions.
    4.  **Backup Before Update:** Always create a full backup of the GitLab instance (database, configuration, repositories, etc.) before applying any updates. This allows for quick rollback in case of issues during the update process.
    5.  **Apply Updates:** Follow GitLab's official update documentation to apply the updates to the production instance. This typically involves using package managers (for Omnibus installations) or Docker commands (for Docker-based installations).
    6.  **Post-Update Verification:** After applying updates, verify that GitLab is functioning correctly and that all critical features are working as expected. Check GitLab logs for any errors or warnings.
    7.  **Monitor for New Updates:** Continuously monitor GitLab's security announcements for new updates and repeat the update process regularly.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known GitLab Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):** GitLab, like any software, may have security vulnerabilities. Regular updates and patching address these known vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from exploiting them to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known GitLab Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Regularly patching GitLab is crucial to mitigate the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Failing to update leaves the GitLab instance vulnerable to publicly disclosed exploits.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. No formal schedule or process for GitLab updates is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal process for regularly checking for, testing, and applying GitLab updates needs to be established and implemented. This includes subscribing to security announcements, setting up a staging environment for testing updates, and defining a backup and rollback procedure.
