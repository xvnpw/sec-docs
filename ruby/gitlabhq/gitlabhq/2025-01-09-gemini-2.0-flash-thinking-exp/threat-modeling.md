# Threat Model Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Threat: [Personal Access Token (PAT) Exposure](./threats/personal_access_token__pat__exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Personal Access Token (PAT) Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user's Personal Access Token (PAT) through methods like phishing, accidental commit to a public repository, or insecure storage. The attacker can then impersonate the user and perform actions within GitLab on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to repositories, including reading sensitive code, modifying code, creating or deleting projects, accessing CI/CD pipelines, and potentially exfiltrating data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication, API Access
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate users on the importance of keeping PATs secret and recognizing phishing attempts.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and revoke exposed PATs (e.g., scanning public repositories).
        *   Encourage the use of short-lived PATs with limited scopes.
        *   Promote the use of more secure authentication methods like SSH keys or OAuth where applicable.
        *   Implement logging and monitoring of API calls to detect suspicious activity.

## Threat: [SSH Key Compromise](./threats/ssh_key_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** SSH Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a user's private SSH key, either through direct access to their machine or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how GitLab stores or manages SSH keys. This allows the attacker to authenticate as the user and access their repositories.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to repositories, allowing the attacker to clone, push, and potentially rewrite repository history, leading to code corruption or data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication, Repository Access
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate users on secure SSH key management practices, including using strong passphrases and protecting private keys.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and revoke compromised SSH keys.
        *   Consider using certificate-based authentication for SSH.
        *   Regularly audit authorized SSH keys.
        *   Enforce the use of strong passphrases for SSH keys.

## Threat: [Malicious CI/CD Pipeline Injection](./threats/malicious_cicd_pipeline_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious CI/CD Pipeline Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to a repository or the ability to modify CI/CD configuration files injects malicious code into the pipeline. This code can then be executed on the GitLab Runner, potentially compromising the build environment or deploying malicious artifacts.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on GitLab Runner infrastructure, exposure of secrets stored in CI/CD variables, deployment of backdoors or malicious software, supply chain compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** GitLab CI/CD
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for modifying CI/CD configuration files.
        *   Use signed commits and protected branches to limit who can merge changes.
        *   Regularly review CI/CD configurations for suspicious activity.
        *   Harden GitLab Runner environments and limit their access to sensitive resources.
        *   Implement security scanning within the CI/CD pipeline to detect malicious code.
        *   Utilize ephemeral runners where possible.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_webhooks.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks
    *   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify webhooks configures a webhook to target internal network resources or external services. When a triggering event occurs in GitLab, the GitLab server makes a request to the attacker-controlled URL, potentially exposing internal services or allowing the attacker to interact with external systems on behalf of the GitLab server.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal services, access to internal APIs, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, data exfiltration from internal networks, abuse of external services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Webhooks, Integrations
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for webhook URLs.
        *   Restrict the network access of the GitLab server to only necessary external resources.
        *   Consider using allowlists for allowed webhook destinations.
        *   Implement monitoring and logging of outgoing requests from the GitLab server.
        *   Disable or restrict the use of private network addresses in webhook configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Git Protocol Handling](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_git_protocol_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Git Protocol Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in GitLab's implementation of the Git protocol (e.g., during `git clone`, `git push`, `git fetch`) to perform actions like remote code execution on the GitLab server or arbitrary file read/write.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data breaches, code manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Git Protocol Handling (e.g., `gitlab-shell`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep GitLab updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Monitor for and promptly address reported vulnerabilities in the Git protocol and related components.
        *   Implement security hardening measures for the GitLab server environment.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Secrets in CI/CD Variables](./threats/insecure_handling_of_secrets_in_cicd_variables.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Secrets in CI/CD Variables
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is stored insecurely in CI/CD variables (e.g., not masked properly, accessible to unauthorized users or jobs). This can lead to the exposure of these secrets.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of external services or systems that rely on the exposed secrets, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** GitLab CI/CD Variables
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize masked variables for sensitive information.
        *   Restrict access to CI/CD variables to authorized users and jobs.
        *   Consider using external secret management solutions integrated with GitLab.
        *   Regularly audit CI/CD variable configurations.
