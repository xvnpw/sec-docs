# Attack Surface Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malicious___gitlab-ci_yml__exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` files within repositories to execute arbitrary commands on GitLab CI runners.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab's CI/CD pipeline executes the instructions defined in these user-controlled YAML files.
    *   **Example:** A malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` could contain a `script:` directive that downloads and executes a reverse shell on the runner.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the CI runner, potential access to secrets and infrastructure managed by the runner, supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into build artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation for CI/CD variables and environment variables.
        *   Use secure runner configurations with limited privileges.
        *   Employ container image scanning for vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce code review for `.gitlab-ci.yml` changes.
        *   Consider using ephemeral runners that are destroyed after each job.
        *   Utilize GitLab's features for restricting runner access to specific projects.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL API Introspection and Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/graphql_api_introspection_and_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  The GraphQL API, if not properly secured, can expose its schema, allowing attackers to understand the available queries and mutations and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab provides a GraphQL API for various functionalities. An improperly configured or secured API endpoint can be a significant entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use introspection to discover a mutation that allows them to modify user roles or project settings without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, manipulation of GitLab settings, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable introspection in production environments.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all GraphQL queries and mutations.
        *   Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly audit GraphQL schema for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Use allow-listing for permitted queries and mutations instead of relying solely on deny-listing.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Manipulation and SSRF](./attack_surfaces/webhook_manipulation_and_ssrf.md)

*   **Description:** Webhooks, used for integrating GitLab with other services, can be manipulated by attackers to trigger unintended actions or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab allows users to configure webhooks that send HTTP requests to external URLs upon specific events.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate the webhook URL to point to an internal service, potentially gaining access to internal resources or triggering actions on that service.
    *   **Impact:** SSRF attacks leading to internal network access, data exfiltration, or denial of service of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for webhook URLs.
        *   Implement signature verification for incoming webhook requests.
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize webhook URLs provided by users.
        *   Consider using a dedicated service for handling webhook requests to add an extra layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in GitLab's Markdown rendering engine can allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into issues, merge requests, comments, or repository files, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab uses Markdown for formatting user-generated content across various parts of the application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a `<script>` tag into an issue description that steals session cookies when another user views the issue.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Markdown rendering library to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Sanitize and escape user-provided Markdown input before rendering.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed rendering environment.

## Attack Surface: [Container Registry API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_registry_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in GitLab's Container Registry API can allow attackers to push or pull images without proper authorization, potentially injecting malicious containers into the supply chain.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab integrates a Container Registry for storing and managing Docker images.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an authentication bypass in the registry API to push a compromised container image to a project's registry.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, deployment of vulnerable or malicious containers, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Container Registry API is properly secured with robust authentication and authorization.
        *   Regularly update the Container Registry component.
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning for container images.
        *   Enforce access control policies for pushing and pulling images.

## Attack Surface: [Repository Import/Export Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/repository_importexport_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the repository import/export functionality could allow attackers to inject malicious code or data during the import process.
    *   **How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab provides features to import and export repositories in various formats.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a specially crafted repository export archive that, when imported into GitLab, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the GitLab server, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize imported repository data.
        *   Use secure archive formats and libraries for import/export operations.
        *   Implement strict access controls for the import/export functionality.
        *   Regularly update the libraries used for handling repository archives.
