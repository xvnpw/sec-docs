## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Environment Variables in Deployment Process (GitLab)

As a cybersecurity expert collaborating with the development team on our GitLab-based application, let's delve deep into the attack tree path: **Manipulate Environment Variables in Deployment Process (Achieved via manipulating CI/CD configuration)**.

This attack path focuses on exploiting the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious environment variables, ultimately compromising the deployed application. It highlights a critical vulnerability: the trust placed in the integrity of the CI/CD process.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The core idea is that an attacker, having gained unauthorized access or influence over the CI/CD configuration, can introduce or modify environment variables that are then used by the deployed application. This bypasses traditional security measures within the application itself, as the application trusts the environment it runs in.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Initial Access/Influence over CI/CD Configuration:** This is the critical first step. The attacker needs to be able to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or other relevant CI/CD settings within the GitLab project. This can be achieved through several means:
    * **Compromised Developer Account:**  Gaining access to a developer's GitLab account (via phishing, credential stuffing, malware, etc.) allows direct modification of the repository and CI/CD configuration.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Runner:** If the CI/CD runner itself is compromised, an attacker might be able to inject variables directly into the execution environment.
    * **Exploiting GitLab Vulnerabilities:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the GitLab instance itself could allow unauthorized access or modification of project settings.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with sufficient permissions could intentionally manipulate the CI/CD configuration.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromising dependencies or tools used in the CI/CD process could allow indirect modification of the configuration.
    * **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficiently restrictive permissions on the GitLab repository or CI/CD settings can make it easier for unauthorized individuals to make changes.

2. **Modifying CI/CD Configuration:** Once access is gained, the attacker will modify the CI/CD configuration to introduce or alter environment variables. This can be done in several ways within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or GitLab project settings:
    * **Directly Setting Environment Variables:**  Using the `variables:` keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to define new variables or overwrite existing ones.
    * **Using `before_script` or `script` blocks:** Injecting commands within these blocks that set environment variables using shell commands (e.g., `export`).
    * **Manipulating Secret Variables:** If the attacker gains access to the GitLab project's secret variables, they can modify existing secrets or add new malicious ones.
    * **Modifying Deployment Scripts:** Altering scripts used in the deployment stage to set or manipulate environment variables before the application starts.
    * **Leveraging External Configuration:**  Modifying the CI/CD configuration to pull environment variables from a compromised external source (e.g., a malicious configuration server).

3. **Deployment Process Execution:**  The modified CI/CD configuration is executed during the deployment process. The CI/CD runner will then set the environment variables as defined in the manipulated configuration.

4. **Application Startup and Variable Consumption:** The deployed application reads and uses the environment variables set during the deployment process. This is where the malicious injection takes effect.

**Potential Malicious Injections and their Impact:**

The impact of this attack path can be severe, depending on the nature of the injected variables. Here are some examples:

* **Injecting Malicious API Keys or Credentials:**
    * **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to access external services with elevated privileges, leading to data breaches, financial losses, or further compromise of other systems.
* **Modifying Database Connection Strings:**
    * **Impact:**  Redirects the application to a malicious database controlled by the attacker, enabling data exfiltration, manipulation, or denial of service.
* **Altering Logging or Monitoring Configurations:**
    * **Impact:**  Hinders detection of malicious activity by silencing logs or redirecting them to attacker-controlled systems.
* **Injecting Malicious Feature Flags:**
    * **Impact:**  Enables hidden backdoors or vulnerabilities within the application, granting the attacker unauthorized access or control.
* **Modifying Security Headers or Configurations:**
    * **Impact:**  Weakens the application's security posture, making it vulnerable to other attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Clickjacking.
* **Injecting Malicious URLs or Service Endpoints:**
    * **Impact:**  Redirects application traffic to attacker-controlled servers, potentially capturing sensitive data or serving malicious content.
* **Overriding Critical Application Settings:**
    * **Impact:**  Changes the application's behavior in unintended and potentially harmful ways, leading to instability, data corruption, or security breaches.

**Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Compromised Developer Account:** An attacker phishes a developer, gains their GitLab credentials, and directly modifies the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to inject a malicious API key.
* **Scenario 2: Exploiting GitLab Vulnerability:** An unpatched vulnerability in the GitLab instance allows an attacker to gain administrative access and modify the project's secret variables, injecting a malicious database password.
* **Scenario 3: Compromised CI/CD Runner:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD runner and modifies its configuration to inject environment variables during the deployment process, bypassing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
* **Scenario 4: Supply Chain Attack:** A dependency used in the CI/CD process is compromised, and its updates include malicious code that modifies the environment variables during deployment.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively defend against this attack path, a multi-layered approach is crucial:

* **Strong Access Controls and Authentication:**
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all GitLab accounts, especially those with permissions to modify CI/CD configurations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and service accounts. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access.
    * **Secure Key Management:**  Store and manage GitLab API tokens and other sensitive credentials securely. Avoid storing them directly in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
* **Secure CI/CD Configuration Management:**
    * **Code Review for CI/CD Changes:** Implement mandatory code reviews for any changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
    * **Version Control for CI/CD Configuration:** Treat the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file as code and track changes using Git.
    * **Protected Branches:** Protect the main branch and require merge requests with approvals for changes to the CI/CD configuration.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Whenever possible, use immutable infrastructure to minimize the risk of runtime modifications.
* **Secure Secret Management:**
    * **GitLab Secret Variables:** Utilize GitLab's built-in secret variable feature to securely store and manage sensitive information.
    * **External Secret Management Solutions:** Integrate with dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for enhanced security and auditing.
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode sensitive information directly in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or application code.
