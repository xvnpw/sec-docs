## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Tamper with CI/CD Variables or Secrets (Requires compromised credentials or bypass) on GitLab

This analysis delves into the attack path "Tamper with CI/CD Variables or Secrets (Requires compromised credentials or bypass)" within the context of a GitLab instance (gitlabhq). We will break down the attack, its implications, potential attack vectors, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path targets the integrity and security of the CI/CD pipeline within GitLab. Attackers aim to manipulate the execution flow of builds and deployments by altering critical variables or gaining access to sensitive secrets used in the process. The prerequisite explicitly states the attacker needs either compromised credentials with sufficient permissions or a way to bypass access controls to the CI/CD settings.

**Breakdown of the Attack:**

The attack path can be further broken down into two primary objectives:

1. **Modifying CI/CD Variables to Inject Malicious Values:**
    * **Goal:** To influence the build or deployment process to introduce malicious code, alter configurations, or disrupt operations.
    * **Mechanism:** By changing the values of environment variables used during CI/CD jobs, attackers can:
        * **Inject malicious code:**  Introduce backdoors, malware, or data exfiltration scripts into the build artifacts.
        * **Alter build configurations:** Change compiler flags, dependencies, or build scripts to introduce vulnerabilities or bypass security checks.
        * **Manipulate deployment targets:** Redirect deployments to rogue servers or environments.
        * **Cause denial of service:**  Introduce resource-intensive operations or infinite loops in the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Stealing Secrets to Gain Access to Other Systems or Data:**
    * **Goal:** To obtain sensitive information stored as CI/CD variables or secrets to gain unauthorized access to other systems, databases, or cloud resources.
    * **Mechanism:** By gaining access to the stored secrets, attackers can:
        * **Obtain API keys and tokens:**  Access cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), third-party services, or internal APIs.
        * **Retrieve database credentials:** Gain access to sensitive data stored in databases.
        * **Acquire encryption keys:** Potentially decrypt sensitive data or compromise secure communication channels.
        * **Elevate privileges:** Use stolen credentials to access more sensitive areas within GitLab or connected systems.

**Prerequisites: Compromised Credentials or Bypass:**

This is the crucial first step for the attacker. Let's analyze how an attacker might achieve this:

**A. Compromised Credentials:**

* **Phishing:** Targeting developers, operations personnel, or anyone with access to GitLab with phishing emails or malicious links to steal their credentials.
* **Credential Stuffing/Brute-forcing:** If weak or default passwords are used, attackers might try to guess or brute-force their way into accounts.
* **Malware:** Infecting developer machines with keyloggers or information stealers to capture credentials.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent employees with legitimate access.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising developer tools or dependencies that have access to GitLab credentials.
* **Reused Passwords:** Exploiting the use of the same password across multiple platforms.

**B. Bypass of Access Controls:**

* **Software Vulnerabilities in GitLab:** Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in GitLab itself to gain unauthorized access to CI/CD settings.
* **Misconfigurations in GitLab Permissions:**  Incorrectly configured roles and permissions allowing unauthorized users to view or modify CI/CD variables and secrets.
* **API Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the GitLab API to bypass authentication or authorization checks related to CI/CD resources.
* **Lack of Proper Segregation of Duties:**  Allowing developers or operators excessive permissions over CI/CD settings.
* **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms:**  Not enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) or using weak authentication methods.

**Impact Analysis:**

The successful execution of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Supply Chain Compromise:** Injecting malicious code into the build process can lead to the distribution of compromised software to end-users, causing widespread damage and reputational harm.
* **Data Breach:** Stealing secrets can grant attackers access to sensitive data, leading to financial loss, regulatory fines, and loss of customer trust.
* **Infrastructure Compromise:** Gaining access to cloud provider credentials or other infrastructure secrets can allow attackers to control and potentially destroy critical infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service:** Manipulating CI/CD variables can disrupt the development and deployment pipeline, causing significant delays and impacting business operations.
* **Reputational Damage:** Security breaches can severely damage the reputation of the organization, leading to loss of customers and business opportunities.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches and security incidents can result in legal action and regulatory penalties.

**Potential Attack Vectors and Specific Examples within GitLab:**

* **Modifying `.gitlab-ci.yml` Variables:** Attackers with compromised credentials could directly edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in a project to introduce new environment variables with malicious values or modify existing ones.
* **Manipulating Project-Level or Group-Level CI/CD Variables:** GitLab allows defining CI/CD variables at the project and group levels. Attackers could leverage compromised credentials to modify these settings through the GitLab UI or API.
* **Accessing Masked Variables:** While GitLab offers masked variables for sensitive information, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations could potentially allow attackers to reveal these masked values.
* **Exploiting GitLab API Endpoints:** Attackers could use compromised API tokens or exploit API vulnerabilities to directly interact with CI/CD variable management endpoints.
* **Compromising GitLab Runners:** If GitLab Runners are misconfigured or vulnerable, attackers could potentially gain access to the environment where CI/CD jobs are executed and intercept or modify variables and secrets.
* **Targeting Integrations:** If GitLab is integrated with external secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), attackers might target those integrations to gain access to secrets used in the CI/CD pipeline.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

A layered approach is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with this attack path:

**A. Preventing Credential Compromise:**

* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and regular password changes.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Mandate MFA for all users, especially those with administrative or CI/CD access.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about phishing, social engineering, and other credential theft techniques.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Review user permissions and access controls regularly.
* **Implement Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Monitor for Suspicious Login Activity:** Implement alerts for unusual login attempts or failed login patterns.
* **Secure Developer Workstations:** Implement endpoint security measures to protect developer machines from malware.

**B. Hardening GitLab CI/CD Security:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege for CI/CD Access:**  Restrict access to CI/CD settings to only authorized personnel.
* **Secure Secret Management Practices:**
    * **Avoid Storing Secrets Directly in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**  Use GitLab's masked variables or integrate with dedicated secret management tools.
    * **Regularly Rotate Secrets:**  Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
    * **Use Environment-Specific Secrets:**  Avoid using the same secrets across different environments (development, staging, production).
* **Input Validation for CI/CD Variables:**  Sanitize and validate any external input used in CI/CD jobs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Code Review for `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**  Treat `.gitlab-ci.yml` files as code and subject them to thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious configurations.
