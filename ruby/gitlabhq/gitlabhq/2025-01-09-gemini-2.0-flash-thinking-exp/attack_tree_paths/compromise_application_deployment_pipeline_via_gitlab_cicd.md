## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application Deployment Pipeline via GitLab CI/CD

This analysis delves into the specific attack tree path focusing on compromising the application deployment pipeline through GitLab CI/CD. We will break down each sub-node, analyze the attacker's methodology, required skills, potential impact, and relevant mitigation strategies within the context of a GitLab-hosted application.

**High-Level Attack Path:** Compromise Application Deployment Pipeline via GitLab CI/CD

**Significance:** This attack path is particularly critical because it targets the heart of the software delivery process. A successful compromise here allows attackers to inject malicious code into the production environment, affecting all users of the application. This bypasses traditional security measures focused on the application's codebase itself. The trust placed in the CI/CD pipeline makes it a high-value target.

**Detailed Analysis of Sub-Nodes:**

**1. Injecting malicious code into build artifacts during the CI/CD process, leading to the deployment of a compromised application.**

* **Attacker Methodology:**
    * **Compromise Dependencies:**  Attackers could target upstream dependencies used in the project. This could involve:
        * **Typosquatting:** Registering packages with names similar to legitimate dependencies.
        * **Compromising legitimate dependency repositories:** Gaining access to and modifying existing packages.
        * **Dependency Confusion:** Exploiting how package managers resolve dependencies from public and private registries.
    * **Manipulate `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**  Gaining write access to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file allows attackers to modify build scripts, adding malicious commands. This could involve:
        * **Directly inserting malicious commands:** Downloading and executing malware, modifying build outputs.
        * **Introducing vulnerable build tools:**  Using older or compromised versions of build tools that facilitate code injection.
    * **Compromise Developer/Maintainer Accounts:** Access to developer accounts with write permissions to the repository allows for direct modification of source code, build scripts, and CI/CD configurations.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Runners:**  If the CI/CD runners themselves are vulnerable (e.g., unpatched software, insecure configurations), attackers could gain control and inject malicious code during the build process.
    * **Manipulate Build Environment:** If the build environment is not properly isolated and secured, attackers might be able to inject malicious files or configurations that are picked up during the build process.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks on Internal Tools:** If the CI/CD pipeline relies on internal tools or scripts, compromising these tools can lead to the injection of malicious code.

* **Required Skills:**
    * **Software Development Knowledge:** Understanding of the application's build process, dependencies, and CI/CD configuration.
    * **Git/GitLab Expertise:**  Understanding of Git workflows, branching strategies, and GitLab CI/CD syntax.
    * **Scripting and Automation:** Proficiency in scripting languages used in the build process (e.g., Bash, Python).
    * **Security Vulnerability Research:** Ability to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies, build tools, or CI/CD configurations.
    * **Social Engineering (Optional):**  To compromise developer accounts.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Backdoored Application:**  The deployed application contains malicious code allowing for persistent access, data exfiltration, or further attacks.
    * **Data Breach:**  Malicious code can be designed to steal sensitive data from the application's environment or user interactions.
    * **Service Disruption:**  The injected code could cause the application to malfunction or become unavailable.
    * **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If the application is a library or component used by others, the compromise can propagate to downstream users.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach due to a compromised deployment pipeline can severely damage the organization's reputation.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Access Controls:** Implement robust access controls for the GitLab repository, limiting write access to necessary personnel. Utilize branch protection rules and mandatory code reviews.
    * **Dependency Management:** Employ dependency scanning tools (e.g., GitLab Dependency Scanning, Snyk) to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies. Use dependency pinning and lock files to ensure consistent builds.
    * **Secure CI/CD Configuration:**  Implement code reviews for `.gitlab-ci.yml` changes. Use templating and reusable CI/CD components to enforce consistent and secure configurations.
    * **Runner Security:**  Harden CI/CD runners by keeping their software up-to-date, implementing network segmentation, and using ephemeral runners where possible.
    * **Secrets Management:** Securely manage secrets used in the CI/CD pipeline using GitLab's Secrets Management feature or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault). Avoid hardcoding secrets in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    * **Artifact Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of build artifacts before deployment (e.g., digital signatures, checksums).
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD pipeline configuration and processes.
    * **Supply Chain Security Practices:** Implement policies and tools to assess the security of third-party dependencies and internal tools.

**2. Deploying a completely backdoored version of the application by manipulating the CI/CD pipeline.**

* **Attacker Methodology:**
    * **Compromise Build Process:**  Attackers could replace the entire application build with a pre-built, malicious version. This could involve:
        * **Modifying `.gitlab-ci.yml` to skip the build stage:**  And directly deploy a malicious artifact from a compromised location.
        * **Compromising the artifact repository:**  Replacing legitimate build artifacts with backdoored ones.
    * **Manipulate Release Process:** Attackers could manipulate the release process to deploy a malicious version even if the build process is intact. This could involve:
        * **Gaining access to release credentials:**  Used to push updates to production environments.
        * **Modifying release scripts:** To deploy a different artifact than intended.
    * **Leverage Compromised Infrastructure:** If the infrastructure hosting the CI/CD pipeline or the deployment targets is compromised, attackers can directly deploy malicious applications.

* **Required Skills:**
    * **In-depth understanding of the application's deployment process:**  Knowledge of how the application is packaged, released, and deployed.
    * **Git/GitLab Expertise:**  Understanding of branching strategies, release tagging, and GitLab CI/CD workflows.
    * **Infrastructure Management (Optional):**  Depending on the deployment environment.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Complete Control over the Application:** The deployed application is entirely under the attacker's control, allowing for any malicious activity.
    * **Massive Data Breach:**  Attackers can exfiltrate all data handled by the application.
    * **Service Outage:**  The backdoored application could be designed to disrupt or completely shut down the service.
    * **Reputational Catastrophe:**  Deploying a completely malicious application can lead to irreparable damage to trust and reputation.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement multi-factor authentication for all GitLab accounts, especially those with administrative or deployment privileges.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Granularly control access to different parts of the CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Utilize immutable infrastructure principles where possible, making it harder to modify deployed applications after the fact.
    * **Deployment Verification:** Implement automated checks and verification steps after deployment to ensure the deployed application matches the expected version and integrity.
    * **Change Management Processes:**  Enforce strict change management processes for any modifications to the CI/CD pipeline or deployment configurations.
    * **Regular Security Scanning of Infrastructure:**  Scan the infrastructure hosting the CI/CD pipeline and deployment targets for vulnerabilities.

**3. Manipulating environment variables used in the deployment process to alter application behavior or gain access to sensitive resources.**

* **Attacker Methodology:**
    * **Compromise CI/CD Secrets:** Attackers could gain access to environment variables stored as secrets within GitLab CI/CD. This could involve:
        * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in GitLab's secrets management.**
        * **Compromising developer accounts with access to secrets.**
        * **Accidental exposure of secrets (e.g., in logs, configuration files).**
    * **Modify `.gitlab-ci.yml` to inject malicious environment variables:**  Attackers could modify the CI/CD configuration to set environment variables that alter the application's behavior.
    * **Compromise the environment where CI/CD runs:** If the CI/CD runner environment is compromised, attackers could potentially access or modify environment variables.
