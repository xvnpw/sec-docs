## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious Stages/Jobs into .gitlab-ci.yml

This analysis delves into the attack path "Inject Malicious Stages/Jobs into .gitlab-ci.yml (Requires compromised credentials or bypass)" within the context of a GitLab application (as represented by the `gitlabhq/gitlabhq` repository). We will break down the attack, its prerequisites, execution, potential impact, and mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path Breakdown:**

* **Root Goal:** Compromise the application or its infrastructure through the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Specific Attack:** Injecting malicious stages or jobs into the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Compromised Credentials:**  Gaining access to accounts with permissions to modify the repository's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This could include:
        * Developer accounts.
        * Maintainer accounts.
        * Owner accounts.
        * CI/CD service accounts (if improperly secured).
    * **Bypass:** Circumventing access controls designed to protect the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This could involve:
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in GitLab itself that allow unauthorized modification of the file.
        * Social engineering tactics to convince a legitimate user to make the changes.
        * Exploiting misconfigurations in branch protection rules or CI/CD settings.

**Detailed Analysis of the Attack Path:**

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is the heart of GitLab's CI/CD system. It defines the stages, jobs, and scripts that are executed by GitLab Runner whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pipeline is triggered. An attacker who can modify this file gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the GitLab Runner environment.

**Prerequisites in Detail:**

* **Compromised Credentials:**
    * **Phishing:**  Tricking users into revealing their usernames and passwords.
    * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-forcing:**  Using lists of known credentials or attempting numerous password combinations.
    * **Malware:**  Infecting developer machines to steal credentials or session tokens.
    * **Password Reuse:**  Exploiting the common practice of users reusing passwords across multiple platforms.
    * **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access.
    * **Compromised Service Accounts:**  If CI/CD pipelines use service accounts for authentication, compromising these accounts grants significant control.
    * **Leaked Credentials:**  Accidental exposure of credentials in code repositories, configuration files, or other sensitive locations.

* **Bypass:**
    * **GitLab Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting security flaws in GitLab's web interface, API, or Git handling that allow unauthorized file modification. This is less common but a critical risk.
    * **Misconfigured Branch Protection:**  If branch protection rules are not properly configured, an attacker might be able to push malicious changes directly to a protected branch.
    * **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lack of proper permissions management on the repository, allowing unauthorized users to modify files.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a legitimate user with the necessary permissions into making the malicious changes under the guise of a legitimate request.
    * **Exploiting Merge Request Processes:**  Submitting a malicious merge request that, if carelessly reviewed or automatically merged, introduces the malicious changes.
    * **Direct Access to the Server:** In rare cases, an attacker might gain direct access to the GitLab server and modify the file system directly.

**Attack Execution:**

Once the attacker has achieved the necessary prerequisites, they can modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to inject malicious stages or jobs. This can be done in several ways:

* **Adding New Malicious Stages:**  Introducing entirely new stages to the pipeline that execute malicious scripts.
* **Modifying Existing Stages:**  Adding malicious commands to existing jobs within legitimate stages. This can be more stealthy.
* **Introducing Malicious Scripts:**  Referencing external malicious scripts hosted elsewhere that will be downloaded and executed by the GitLab Runner.
* **Manipulating Environment Variables:**  Setting or modifying environment variables used by the pipeline to inject malicious behavior.
* **Exploiting Unsanitized Input:**  Introducing code that exploits vulnerabilities in scripts or tools used within the pipeline by providing malicious input.

**Examples of Malicious Actions:**

The attacker can leverage the GitLab Runner's execution environment to perform a wide range of malicious activities:

* **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data from the application's environment, databases, or build artifacts.
* **Infrastructure Compromise:**  Using the Runner's credentials or network access to attack other systems within the infrastructure.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Injecting malicious code into the application's build artifacts, potentially affecting downstream users or systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Consuming resources or disrupting the build and deployment process.
* **Cryptojacking:**  Using the Runner's resources to mine cryptocurrency.
* **Backdoor Installation:**  Creating persistent access points for future attacks.
* **Code Manipulation:**  Altering the application's source code during the build process.
* **Credential Harvesting:**  Stealing credentials used by the pipeline or stored in the environment.

**Potential Impact:**

The impact of successfully injecting malicious stages/jobs into `.gitlab-ci.yml` can be severe:

* **Compromise of the Application:**  Directly affecting the security and functionality of the deployed application.
* **Data Breach:**  Loss of sensitive customer data, proprietary information, or internal secrets.
* **Infrastructure Breach:**  Gaining access to other servers, databases, or network segments.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:**  Distributing malware or vulnerabilities to users of the application.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from customers and stakeholders.
* **Financial Losses:**  Due to recovery costs, legal repercussions, and business disruption.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Fines and penalties for failing to protect sensitive data.
* **Loss of Intellectual Property:**  Theft of valuable source code or trade secrets.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent and detect this type of attack, a multi-layered approach is crucial:

**Preventive Measures:**

* **Strong Access Controls:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and modify the repository and CI/CD settings.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular roles and permissions for different users and groups.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users with access to the repository and GitLab instance.
* **Secure Credential Management:**
    * **Avoid Storing Secrets in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:** Use GitLab CI/CD variables (especially masked variables) or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    * **Regularly Rotate Credentials:** Change passwords and API keys frequently.
    * **Secure Service Account Management:**  Properly secure and monitor service accounts used by CI/CD pipelines.
* **Branch Protection Rules:**
    * **Require Code Reviews:** Mandate peer reviews for changes to protected branches, including the branch containing `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    * **Restrict Push Access:** Limit who can directly push to protected branches.
    * **Require Status Checks:** Ensure successful pipeline execution before allowing merges to protected branches.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If the pipeline accepts external input, ensure it is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
* **GitLab Security Hardening:**
    * **Keep GitLab Up-to-Date:** Regularly update GitLab to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure GitLab Runner:**  Harden the GitLab Runner environment and limit its access.
    * **Review GitLab Configuration:**  Regularly audit GitLab's configuration for security missteps.
* **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Implement code review processes and use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and associated scripts.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with compromised CI/CD pipelines and social engineering attacks.
