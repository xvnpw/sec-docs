## Attack Tree Path: [[[1. Exploit GitLab CE Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1__exploit_gitlab_ce_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker's attempt to leverage flaws within the GitLab CE codebase itself to achieve their goal. This is a critical node because successful exploitation often leads to high-impact consequences, such as complete system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (GitLab actively addresses vulnerabilities, but new ones can emerge.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the system.)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific vulnerability; zero-days require high effort, while publicly disclosed exploits may require low effort.)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (From Script Kiddie for public exploits to Expert for zero-days.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Easy for known exploits with signatures, Very Hard for sophisticated zero-days.)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.1 RCE via Git Uploads]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_1_rce_via_git_uploads__.md)

*   **Description:** This node focuses on achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting vulnerabilities related to how GitLab handles Git uploads and repository interactions. This is a critical node due to the very high impact of RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Historically, vulnerabilities in this area have been found and patched.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of Git internals and GitLab's processing of Git commands.)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Sophisticated attacks might bypass basic logging; requires deep packet inspection or behavioral analysis.)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.1.1 Specially Crafted Git Commands]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_1_1_specially_crafted_git_commands__.md)

*   **Description:** This represents a specific, high-risk attack vector within the broader RCE category. It involves crafting malicious Git commands, hooks, or repository structures that, when processed by GitLab, trigger unintended code execution. This is a critical node because it represents a concrete and historically proven attack method.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (GitLab patches these vulnerabilities, but new ones can be discovered.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the GitLab server.)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires in-depth knowledge of Git and GitLab's internal workings.)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires specialized monitoring and analysis of Git operations.)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2. Leverage Misconfigurations/Weak Defaults]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2__leverage_misconfigurationsweak_defaults__.md)

* **Description:** This branch represents attacks that take advantage of incorrect configurations or insecure default settings within the GitLab instance.
    * **Likelihood:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration.)
    * **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration.)
    * **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration.)
    * **Skill Level:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration.)
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration.)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.1 Weak Admin Password]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_1_weak_admin_password__.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the classic and highly impactful attack of using a weak, default, or easily guessable administrator password. This is a critical node due to its very high impact and low effort required for exploitation.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Most organizations are aware of this risk, but it still happens.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Grants complete control of the GitLab instance.)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Brute-force or dictionary attacks are simple to execute.)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Failed login attempts are typically logged.)
