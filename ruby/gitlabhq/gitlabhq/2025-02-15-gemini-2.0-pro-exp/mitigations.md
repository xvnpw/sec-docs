## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Enforcement of Least Privilege (GitLab Roles & Permissions)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_enforcement_of_least_privilege__gitlab_roles_&_permissions_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Strict Enforcement of Least Privilege (GitLab Roles & Permissions)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize GitLab Roles:**  Assign users to the built-in GitLab roles (Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, Owner) that *precisely* match their required access.  Avoid over-provisioning.
    2.  **Create Custom Roles (if needed):** If the built-in roles are insufficient, define *custom roles* within GitLab with granular permissions tailored to specific job functions.
    3.  **Group-Based Management:** Manage permissions at the *GitLab group level* whenever possible.  Create groups that reflect teams or projects and assign roles to these groups.
    4.  **Project-Specific Roles:** For highly sensitive projects, create *project-specific roles* within GitLab to further restrict access.
    5.  **Regular Audit:** Use GitLab's user management interface to regularly review (e.g., quarterly) user roles and group memberships, removing or downgrading access as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):**  GitLab's permission system directly controls access to repositories, issues, merge requests, etc.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Medium Severity):**  Restricting write access through GitLab roles limits accidental changes.
    *   **Insider Threats (High Severity):**  Granular GitLab permissions make it harder for malicious insiders to abuse their access.
    *   **Compromised Account Impact (High Severity):**  Limits the damage a compromised account can do within GitLab.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Significantly reduced (e.g., 80% risk reduction).
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:**  Moderately reduced (e.g., 50% risk reduction).
    *   **Insider Threats:**  Moderately reduced (e.g., 60% risk reduction).
    *   **Compromised Account Impact:** Significantly reduced (e.g., 75% risk reduction).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic GitLab roles are used.
    *   Group-level permissions are partially implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No custom roles defined within GitLab.
    *   No regular audit process using GitLab's interface.
    *   Project-specific roles are not used.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  2FA/MFA Enforcement (GitLab Settings)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable 2FA in GitLab:**  Use GitLab's administrative settings (in `gitlab.rb` or the admin panel) to enable 2FA/MFA.
    2.  **Enforce 2FA:**  Configure GitLab to *require* 2FA/MFA for all users, or at least for users with elevated GitLab roles (Maintainer, Owner, Admin). This is a setting within GitLab.
    3.  **Select 2FA Methods:**  Choose the 2FA methods (TOTP, U2F) supported by GitLab that you want to allow.
    4.  **Group-Level Enforcement:** Use GitLab's group settings to enforce 2FA at the group level.
    5.  **Monitor Compliance:** Use GitLab's user management interface to track which users have enabled 2FA.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):**  GitLab's 2FA directly mitigates the risk of stolen passwords being used to access the GitLab instance.
    *   **Phishing Attacks (High Severity):**  2FA within GitLab prevents access even if credentials are phished.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  GitLab's 2FA renders brute-force attacks ineffective.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** GitLab's 2FA prevents the use of stolen credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Theft:**  Significantly reduced (e.g., 90% risk reduction).
    *   **Phishing Attacks:**  Significantly reduced (e.g., 90% risk reduction).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Eliminated (100% risk reduction).
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Significantly reduced (e.g., 90% risk reduction).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   2FA is enabled in GitLab's settings.
