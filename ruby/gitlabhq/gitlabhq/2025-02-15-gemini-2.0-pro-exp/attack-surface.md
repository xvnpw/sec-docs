# Attack Surface Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Repository Access/Modification (via GitLab Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_repository_accessmodification__via_gitlab_vulnerabilities_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *within GitLab's code* to gain unauthorized read, write, or delete access to Git repositories, bypassing intended access controls.
*GitLab Contribution:* This is entirely due to GitLab's code, as it handles all repository access logic, authentication, authorization, and interaction with the underlying Git server.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a newly discovered vulnerability in GitLab's branch protection logic (a bug in the `gitlabhq` codebase) to push code to a protected branch without approval.  *This is distinct from a misconfiguration.* Another example: a path traversal vulnerability in GitLab's file handling allows reading arbitrary files from the repository.
*Impact:* Code theft, malicious code injection, data loss, disruption of development, potential compromise of downstream systems.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   Keep GitLab updated to the *absolute latest* version, applying security patches immediately. This is the *primary* defense against code-level vulnerabilities.
        *   Participate in GitLab's bug bounty program (if applicable) to incentivize vulnerability reporting.
        *   Monitor GitLab's security advisories and release notes *very closely*.
        *   Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) configured to detect GitLab-specific attack patterns.
    *   **Developers (of GitLab itself):**
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews with a security focus.
        *   Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Perform regular penetration testing, specifically targeting repository access controls.
        *   Follow secure coding practices (input validation, output encoding, etc.).
        *   Implement robust unit and integration tests to cover security-critical code paths.

## Attack Surface: [CI/CD Pipeline Exploitation (Runner Software Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/cicd_pipeline_exploitation__runner_software_vulnerability_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *in the GitLab Runner software itself* to gain control over the CI/CD execution environment.
*GitLab Contribution:* While runners can be configured insecurely, this focuses on vulnerabilities *within the runner's code*, which is part of the GitLab project.
*Example:* A buffer overflow vulnerability in the GitLab Runner executable allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the runner machine by sending a specially crafted request.
*Impact:* Access to sensitive data, arbitrary code execution, potential compromise of build artifacts and downstream systems.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   Keep GitLab Runner updated to the *absolute latest* version.
        *   Monitor GitLab's security advisories for runner-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers (of GitLab itself):**
        *   Same as above: code reviews, static analysis, penetration testing, secure coding practices, robust testing.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` Exploitation (GitLab Parsing Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/malicious___gitlab-ci_yml__exploitation__gitlab_parsing_vulnerability_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in GitLab's *parsing or execution* of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to achieve unintended code execution, *even if the file itself is not directly modified by the attacker*.
*GitLab Contribution:* This focuses on how GitLab *interprets* the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.  A vulnerability here is a bug in GitLab's code, not a misconfiguration.
*Example:* A vulnerability in GitLab's YAML parser allows an attacker to craft a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that, while seemingly valid, triggers unexpected behavior and executes arbitrary code on the runner due to a flaw in how GitLab handles the YAML structure.
*Impact:* Similar to runner compromise: access to secrets, arbitrary code execution, potential compromise of build artifacts.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   Keep GitLab updated to the latest version.
    *   **Developers (of GitLab itself):**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the YAML parsing and execution logic in GitLab.
        *   Use a secure YAML parser and avoid custom parsing logic where possible.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all values read from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
        *   Consider sandboxing the execution of CI/CD jobs to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (within GitLab's Code)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__within_gitlab's_code_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *in the implementation of GitLab's API endpoints* to bypass security controls, access data, or perform unauthorized actions.
*GitLab Contribution:* This is entirely due to bugs in GitLab's API code.
*Example:* A SQL injection vulnerability in a GitLab API endpoint allows an attacker to extract data from the GitLab database.  Or, an authentication bypass vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate another user via the API.  These are flaws *in the API code itself*.
*Impact:* Wide-ranging, depending on the vulnerability. Could include unauthorized data access, code modification, account takeover, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   Keep GitLab updated to the latest version.
    *   **Developers (of GitLab itself):**
        *   Follow secure coding practices for API development (input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries, etc.).
        *   Use an API framework that provides built-in security features.
        *   Thoroughly test all API endpoints for security vulnerabilities, including authentication, authorization, and input validation.
        *   Implement robust error handling and logging for API calls.

## Attack Surface: [Container Registry Vulnerabilities (within GitLab's Code)](./attack_surfaces/container_registry_vulnerabilities__within_gitlab's_code_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *in GitLab's implementation of the Container Registry* to push malicious images, pull sensitive images, or disrupt the service.
*GitLab Contribution:* This focuses on bugs within GitLab's registry code, not misconfigurations of the registry itself.
*Example:* A vulnerability in GitLab's registry code allows an attacker to bypass authentication and push an image without proper credentials *due to a flaw in the authentication logic*. Or, a directory traversal vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files from the registry's storage.
*Impact:* Deployment of malicious containers, data breaches, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Administrators:**
        * Keep GitLab updated to the latest version.
    * **Developers (of GitLab itself):**
        *   Follow secure coding practices for registry development.
        *   Thoroughly test all registry endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Use secure storage mechanisms for registry data.
