# Threat Model Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Threat: [Compromised GitLab Administrator Account via GitLab-Specific Authentication Bypass](./threats/compromised_gitlab_administrator_account_via_gitlab-specific_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *specific to GitLab's authentication logic* (not a generic web vulnerability) to bypass authentication and gain administrative access. This could involve a flaw in how GitLab handles sessions, tokens, or external authentication integrations (e.g., a misconfigured OAuth flow unique to GitLab's implementation). The attacker would then impersonate an administrator.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the GitLab instance. The attacker can modify any setting, access all repositories, create/delete users, and potentially compromise the underlying server.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `lib/gitlab/auth.rb` (and related authentication modules)
    *   `app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb` (and related controllers handling login/logout)
    *   OmniAuth integration components (if used, e.g., `lib/gitlab/auth/o_auth.rb`)
    *   Two-factor authentication components (if a bypass is found, e.g., `app/models/user.rb` related to 2FA)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thorough security code reviews of authentication-related code, focusing on GitLab-specific logic.
        *   Penetration testing targeting GitLab's authentication mechanisms.
        *   Stay up-to-date with GitLab security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within authentication flows.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for session management and token handling.
    *   **User/Admin:**
        *   Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* administrator accounts.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for administrator accounts.
        *   Regularly review administrator account activity.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Maintainer Account and Unprotected Branch (Focus on GitLab Enforcement)](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised_maintainer_account_and_unprotected_branch__focus_on_gitlab__0eb4b2d1.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user account with "Maintainer" privileges. They push malicious code to an unprotected branch. *This threat focuses on a failure of GitLab to enforce branch protection rules, even if configured.* This implies a bug in the enforcement logic.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the codebase.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `app/models/project.rb` (branch protection logic *enforcement*)
    *   `lib/gitlab/git_access.rb` (access control checks for Git operations - *enforcement*)
    *   `app/services/projects/update_service.rb` (handling project settings updates - *potential bypass*)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure branch protection rules are *correctly and reliably enforced* in the code, with comprehensive testing.
        *   Implement robust access control checks for Git operations, with unit and integration tests.
        *   Investigate and fix any potential bypasses of project settings updates.
    *   **User/Admin:** While user actions are important, this threat highlights a *code-level* failure, so admin actions are secondary mitigation.

## Threat: [Forged Commits via GPG Signature Bypass (GitLab Implementation Flaw)](./threats/forged_commits_via_gpg_signature_bypass__gitlab_implementation_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Git commit with a forged identity.  If GPG signature verification is enabled, *but a vulnerability exists in GitLab's implementation of signature verification*, the attacker bypasses this check. This is *not* about users not using GPG signing, but about GitLab failing to properly verify.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, undermining trust.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `lib/gitlab/gpg.rb` (GPG signature verification *logic*)
    *   `app/models/commit.rb` (commit data handling)
    *   `lib/gitlab/git/commit.rb` (Git commit parsing)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thorough security code reviews of the GPG signature verification code, including edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in the underlying GPG library interaction.
        *   Ensure the GPG library used by GitLab is up-to-date and securely configured.
        *   Penetration testing specifically targeting GPG signature verification *implementation flaws*.
    *   **User/Admin:** User actions are secondary; the core issue is a GitLab code vulnerability.

## Threat: [Unauthorized GitLab Configuration Modification via Server Access (Through a GitLab Vulnerability)](./threats/unauthorized_gitlab_configuration_modification_via_server_access__through_a_gitlab_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to modify GitLab's configuration *through a vulnerability within GitLab itself*. This is *not* about general server access (e.g., SSH compromise), but a flaw in GitLab that allows for unauthorized configuration changes.  For example, a vulnerability in a GitLab API endpoint that allows writing to configuration files.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the GitLab instance.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Any GitLab component that handles configuration updates, particularly via API endpoints.  This could include:
        *   `app/controllers/admin/*` (Admin area controllers)
        *   `lib/api/*` (API endpoints)
        *   `app/services/projects/update_service.rb` (if a vulnerability allows bypassing intended restrictions)
        *   Any component interacting with `config/gitlab.rb`, `config/database.yml`, `config/secrets.yml`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement *extremely* strict input validation and authorization checks for *all* API endpoints and controllers that handle configuration changes.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent file inclusion or path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the admin area and API.
        *   Ensure that configuration changes are properly logged and auditable.
    *   **User/Admin:**  Admin actions are secondary; the core issue is a GitLab code vulnerability.

## Threat: [Malicious Runner Exploitation via Unsandboxed Execution (GitLab Runner Vulnerability)](./threats/malicious_runner_exploitation_via_unsandboxed_execution__gitlab_runner_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a CI/CD job that exploits a vulnerability *in the GitLab Runner itself* (or a vulnerability in a GitLab-provided executor configuration) to escape the intended execution environment and gain access to the Runner host. This focuses on a flaw *within the Runner code or its default configuration*, not just general container escape techniques.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Runner host.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   GitLab Runner itself (e.g., `executor/*` directories in the Runner codebase)
    *   The specific executor being used (Docker, shell, Kubernetes) *if the vulnerability is in GitLab's implementation or default configuration of that executor*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thorough security code reviews of the Runner codebase, particularly the executor implementations.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the Runner.
        *   Stay up-to-date with security advisories for the Runner and any underlying technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
        *   Ensure that the Runner is configured to use secure executors by default, with appropriate security settings.
        *   Implement robust sandboxing mechanisms to prevent escape from the execution environment.
    *   **User/Admin:** User actions are important for secure configuration, but this threat highlights a potential *code-level* vulnerability in the Runner.
