# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Source Code Management: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of source code is paramount. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to significant business disruption and security breaches.
 - CI/CD Pipeline: Ensuring the security and integrity of the CI/CD pipeline is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure secure software delivery.
 - User Authentication and Authorization: Securely managing user identities and access rights is essential to protect sensitive data and resources.
 - Security Scanning and Vulnerability Management: Effectively identifying, tracking, and remediating security vulnerabilities is critical to maintain a secure platform.
 - Issue Tracking and Project Management: While less critical from a direct security perspective, the availability and integrity of project management data are important for business continuity and operational efficiency.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - Source Code: Highly Confidential. Source code is the intellectual property of the organization and its compromise can lead to significant competitive disadvantage and security risks.
 - Credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens): Highly Confidential. Compromise of credentials can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data.
 - User Data (personal information, profiles): Sensitive. User data needs to be protected to comply with privacy regulations and maintain user trust.
 - CI/CD Pipeline Configurations: Sensitive. Misconfiguration or compromise can lead to security breaches and supply chain attacks.
 - Security Scan Results: Sensitive. Vulnerability information needs to be protected to prevent exploitation before remediation.
 - Audit Logs: Sensitive. Audit logs are crucial for security monitoring and incident response and need to be protected from tampering.
 - Project Management Data (issues, merge requests, discussions): Confidential. Project data may contain sensitive business information and should be protected from unauthorized access.
