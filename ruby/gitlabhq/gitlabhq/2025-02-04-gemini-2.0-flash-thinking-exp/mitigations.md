# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Branch Protection](./mitigation_strategies/branch_protection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Within your GitLab project, navigate to **Settings > Repository**.
    *   Step 2: Expand the **Protected branches** section.
    *   Step 3: Use the **Branch** dropdown to select branches requiring protection (e.g., `main`, `develop`). GitLabHQ provides this dropdown to list available branches.
    *   Step 4: Configure GitLabHQ's protection settings:
        *   **Allowed to push:** Restrict direct pushes using GitLabHQ's role-based permissions (e.g., "No one", "Maintainers").
        *   **Allowed to merge:** Control merge access via GitLabHQ roles ("Developers", "Maintainers").
        *   **Require merge requests before merging:** Enforce code review using GitLabHQ's merge request workflow.
        *   **Code owner approval required:** (Optional) Enable GitLabHQ's code owner feature for stricter reviews.
        *   **Prevent force pushes:** Activate GitLabHQ's setting to disallow history rewriting on protected branches.
        *   **Prevent deletion of protected branches:** (Optional) Use GitLabHQ's setting to prevent accidental or malicious branch deletion.
    *   Step 5: Click **Protect** in GitLabHQ to apply the settings. Repeat for other critical branches within GitLabHQ.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Direct pushes to protected branches (High severity) - GitLabHQ's branch protection prevents bypassing code review and direct modification of important branches.
        *   Accidental force pushes (Medium severity) - GitLabHQ prevents accidental history corruption on protected branches.
        *   Malicious force pushes (High severity) - GitLabHQ's protection hinders malicious history rewriting attempts.
        *   Unreviewed code merges (Medium severity) - GitLabHQ's merge request requirement ensures code review before integration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Direct pushes: High reduction - GitLabHQ effectively blocks direct pushes to protected branches.
        *   Force pushes: Medium reduction - GitLabHQ prevents force pushes on protected branches.
        *   Unreviewed merges: Medium reduction - GitLabHQ enforces merge requests for protected branches.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented within GitLabHQ. Branch protection is configured for `main` and `develop` branches in the `core-application` repository within GitLabHQ.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** In GitLabHQ, branch protection is not fully implemented across all repositories. Consider extending it to release and critical feature branches within GitLabHQ projects.  "Code owner approval required" in GitLabHQ is not consistently enabled on all protected branches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via GitLabHQ](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__via_gitlabhq.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Access GitLabHQ's Admin Area (if self-managed) or Group/Instance settings (GitLab.com) through the GitLabHQ interface.
    *   Step 2: Navigate to **Settings > General > Visibility and access controls** (or similar section depending on GitLabHQ version) within GitLabHQ.
    *   Step 3: Locate the **Multi-factor authentication** section in GitLabHQ's settings.
    *   Step 4: Enable GitLabHQ's "Require two-factor authentication for all users" or "Require two-factor authentication for subgroups and projects" to enforce MFA across GitLabHQ.
    *   Step 5: Inform all GitLabHQ users about the MFA requirement and provide GitLabHQ's documentation on setting up MFA (using authenticator apps, SMS, etc. supported by GitLabHQ).
    *   Step 6: Monitor GitLabHQ user MFA adoption and assist users with setup within GitLabHQ.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Account takeover due to compromised passwords (High severity) - GitLabHQ's MFA significantly reduces risk even if GitLabHQ user passwords are compromised.
        *   Brute-force attacks on user accounts (Medium severity) - GitLabHQ's MFA makes brute-forcing GitLabHQ accounts much harder.
        *   Phishing attacks leading to account compromise (Medium severity) - GitLabHQ's MFA adds security even if users enter passwords on fake GitLabHQ login pages.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Account takeover: High reduction - GitLabHQ MFA makes account takeover substantially more difficult.
        *   Brute-force attacks: Medium reduction - GitLabHQ MFA increases effort for successful brute-force.
        *   Phishing attacks: Medium reduction - GitLabHQ MFA adds a layer beyond passwords.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented within GitLabHQ. MFA is enforced for administrators and maintainers in the GitLabHQ instance.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** GitLabHQ MFA is not mandatory for all developers and users. Extend GitLabHQ MFA enforcement to all users for comprehensive protection within GitLabHQ.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CI/CD Variable Management within GitLabHQ](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cicd_variable_management_within_gitlabhq.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When defining CI/CD variables in `.gitlab-ci.yml` or GitLabHQ UI settings, identify sensitive variables (API keys, passwords, tokens) within GitLabHQ.
    *   Step 2: **Never** hardcode sensitive values directly in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files managed by GitLabHQ.
    *   Step 3: Utilize GitLabHQ's "Masked" variables feature for sensitive variables in project/group/instance settings within GitLabHQ. Enable "Masked" to prevent variable values from appearing in GitLabHQ job logs.
    *   Step 4: For highly sensitive secrets, use GitLabHQ's "Protected" variables and restrict access to specific branches or environments within GitLabHQ.
    *   Step 5: For enterprise secret management, integrate with external solutions like HashiCorp Vault using GitLabHQ's integrations.
    *   Step 6: Regularly review and rotate sensitive GitLabHQ CI/CD variables to minimize leak impact.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exposure of secrets in CI/CD logs (High severity) - GitLabHQ's masked variables prevent sensitive credentials from being logged and exposed via GitLabHQ.
        *   Hardcoded secrets in repository (High severity) - Avoids storing secrets directly in GitLabHQ repositories.
        *   Unauthorized access to secrets (Medium severity) - GitLabHQ's "Protected" variables and external secret management control access within GitLabHQ.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Secret exposure in logs: High reduction - GitLabHQ's "Masked" variables effectively prevent logging.
        *   Hardcoded secrets: High reduction - GitLabHQ promotes secure variable management.
        *   Unauthorized access: Medium reduction - GitLabHQ's "Protected" variables and external solutions improve control.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented within GitLabHQ. Masked variables are used for some sensitive CI/CD variables in the `core-application` project in GitLabHQ.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of masked variables across all GitLabHQ projects and CI/CD pipelines. Protected variables in GitLabHQ are not widely used. External secret management (like Vault) integration with GitLabHQ is not yet implemented.
