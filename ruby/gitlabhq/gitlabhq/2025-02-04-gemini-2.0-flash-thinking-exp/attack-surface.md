# Attack Surface Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Attack Surface: [Insecure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cicd_pipeline_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from poorly configured GitLab CI/CD pipelines (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), allowing attackers to inject malicious code or exfiltrate sensitive information during automated builds, tests, and deployments orchestrated by GitLab.
*   **GitLabhq Contribution:** GitLab's core CI/CD functionality, driven by user-defined `.gitlab-ci.yml` files within repositories, directly executes pipeline scripts on GitLab Runners.  The flexibility and powerful scripting capabilities within GitLab CI/CD increase the potential for misconfiguration and exploitation.
*   **Example:** A `.gitlab-ci.yml` file uses `eval` on a variable derived from a merge request title. An attacker crafts a malicious merge request title containing shell commands, leading to command execution on the GitLab Runner when the pipeline runs.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on GitLab Runner infrastructure, exposure of CI/CD secrets (GitLab CI/CD variables), supply chain compromise through manipulated build artifacts, data breaches by accessing repository data or connected systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Avoid `eval` and similar dangerous functions in `.gitlab-ci.yml` scripts.** Use safer alternatives for variable substitution and command execution.
    *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-controlled data used in pipeline scripts.** Treat all external data (e.g., from merge requests, external APIs) as potentially malicious.
    *   **Apply the principle of least privilege to CI/CD jobs.** Limit the permissions and access tokens granted to pipeline jobs to the absolute minimum required. Utilize GitLab's protected branches and environments features.
    *   **Leverage GitLab's secure CI/CD variables for managing secrets.** Avoid hardcoding secrets in `.gitlab-ci.yml` or repository files. Utilize masked variables and protected environments for sensitive credentials.
    *   **Regularly audit and review `.gitlab-ci.yml` configurations for security vulnerabilities.** Implement code review processes for pipeline configurations, focusing on security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [GitLab Runner Compromise](./attack_surfaces/gitlab_runner_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gaining unauthorized control of GitLab Runner instances, which are responsible for executing CI/CD jobs defined in GitLab. Compromised Runners can be used to execute arbitrary code within pipelines and access sensitive resources managed by GitLab.
*   **GitLabhq Contribution:** GitLab Runners are integral to GitLab's CI/CD system. Their security directly impacts the overall security of GitLab and the projects it manages. Misconfigured or vulnerable Runners become a direct entry point into the GitLab ecosystem.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system or container runtime on a self-hosted GitLab Runner. Once compromised, the attacker can intercept and modify CI/CD jobs, steal secrets stored as GitLab CI/CD variables, or pivot to access other systems within the network accessible from the Runner.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise through manipulated builds, data breaches by exfiltrating repository data or secrets, unauthorized access to infrastructure connected to Runners, potential for lateral movement within the network from the compromised Runner.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Isolate GitLab Runners in secure environments.** Run Runners in dedicated virtual machines or containers with restricted network access and strong security configurations.
    *   **Maintain GitLab Runners with regular updates and security patching.** Keep the Runner software, operating system, and container runtime up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Secure GitLab Runner registration and token management.** Protect Runner registration tokens and restrict who can register new Runners. Utilize GitLab's features for managing and revoking Runner tokens.
    *   **Implement robust monitoring and logging for GitLab Runner activity.** Monitor Runner logs for suspicious behavior and security incidents.
    *   **Consider using ephemeral GitLab Runners.** Utilize autoscaling and ephemeral Runner configurations that are destroyed after each job execution to minimize the window of opportunity for persistent compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Git Hook Exploitation for Server-Side Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/git_hook_exploitation_for_server-side_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Abuse of server-side Git hooks within GitLab to execute malicious code directly on the GitLab server. While GitLab discourages direct server-side hook modifications, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities could allow their exploitation.
*   **GitLabhq Contribution:** GitLab supports server-side Git hooks for repository events. Although GitLab emphasizes CI/CD pipelines as the preferred automation method, the presence of Git hooks introduces a potential attack surface if not properly secured and managed within the GitLab environment.
*   **Example:** An attacker with administrative privileges (or through exploiting a vulnerability) modifies a server-side `pre-receive` hook for a repository. This hook is crafted to execute arbitrary commands when a user pushes code to that repository, leading to remote code execution on the GitLab server itself.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the GitLab server, full compromise of the GitLab instance, data breaches, denial of service, and potential cascading failures affecting all GitLab-managed projects.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict access to server-side Git hook modification to only highly trusted administrators.** Implement strict access controls and audit trails for any changes to server-side hooks.
    *   **Thoroughly review and audit all server-side Git hook scripts for security vulnerabilities before deployment.** Implement a rigorous code review process for any server-side hook scripts.
    *   **Apply strong input sanitization within Git hook scripts.** Sanitize any input received by hooks to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Run Git hooks with the principle of least privilege.** Ensure hooks execute with the minimum necessary permissions to reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prioritize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automation over server-side Git hooks.** Encourage users to leverage GitLab's CI/CD system for automation tasks, as it offers more robust security controls and management compared to direct server-side hook modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of SSO and External Authentication Leading to Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_sso_and_external_authentication_leading_to_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure configuration of Single Sign-On (SSO) and external authentication providers within GitLab. Misconfigurations can lead to authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to GitLab instances and projects.
*   **GitLabhq Contribution:** GitLab's integration with various SSO providers (LDAP, SAML, OAuth, etc.) simplifies user authentication but introduces complexity in configuration. Misconfigurations in these integrations can directly undermine GitLab's authentication mechanisms.
*   **Example:** An administrator incorrectly configures SAML integration, failing to properly validate the signature of SAML responses from the Identity Provider (IdP). This allows an attacker to potentially forge SAML responses and bypass GitLab's authentication, gaining unauthorized access as any user.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to GitLab and all projects, account takeover, data breaches, and potential for malicious actions performed under compromised accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Meticulously review and test SSO configurations to ensure correct implementation and security.** Follow GitLab's documentation and SSO provider best practices for secure configuration.
    *   **Regularly audit SSO integrations for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.** Implement periodic security audits specifically focusing on SSO and external authentication setups.
    *   **Enforce the principle of least privilege for SSO permissions and roles.** Grant only necessary permissions to SSO applications and users within GitLab.
    *   **Securely manage keys and secrets used for SAML signing and OAuth client authentication.** Protect private keys and client secrets used for SSO integrations.
    *   **Utilize strong and modern authentication protocols.** Prefer SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0 over older or less secure protocols for SSO integrations.
