### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Code into Repository -> Via Compromised Account

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Path

This attack path describes a two-stage process:

1. **Compromise an Account:** An attacker first gains unauthorized access to a legitimate GitLab user account that possesses write access to a target repository.
2. **Inject Malicious Code:**  Once the account is compromised, the attacker uses their access to inject malicious code into the repository.

The "Why High-Risk" statement highlights the severity because once an account with write access is compromised, the second stage (code injection) becomes relatively straightforward and can have immediate and significant consequences.  Bypassing initial access controls and gaining write permissions is the most challenging part for the attacker.

#### 4.2. Stage 1: Compromise an Account

**Methods of Account Compromise:**

* **Phishing:**  Crafting deceptive emails or websites to trick users into revealing their GitLab credentials (username and password, or even 2FA codes). This is a common and effective method targeting human vulnerabilities.
* **Credential Stuffing/Password Reuse:**  Leveraging leaked credentials from other breaches. If users reuse passwords across multiple services, compromised credentials from another site can be used to access their GitLab account.
* **Brute-Force Attacks (Less Likely with Rate Limiting):**  Attempting to guess passwords through automated trials. GitLab likely has rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to mitigate this, but weak passwords can still be vulnerable.
* **Software Vulnerabilities on User Machines:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in a user's operating system, browser, or other software to install malware (e.g., keyloggers, spyware) that steals GitLab credentials.
* **Session Hijacking:**  Intercepting and stealing valid GitLab session cookies, potentially through network attacks (Man-in-the-Middle) or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (less likely in GitLab itself, but possible in related systems).
* **Insider Threat:**  Malicious actions by disgruntled or compromised employees or contractors with legitimate GitLab access.
* **Social Engineering:**  Manipulating users into divulging their credentials or performing actions that lead to account compromise through non-technical means.

**GitLab Security Controls to Mitigate Account Compromise:**

* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforcing password complexity requirements and regular password changes.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Requiring a second factor of authentication (e.g., TOTP, security key) in addition to passwords, significantly increasing account security. GitLab strongly supports and encourages 2FA.
* **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:**  Limiting login attempts and locking accounts after multiple failed attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **Session Management:**  Secure session handling, including HTTP-only and Secure flags for cookies, session timeouts, and mechanisms to invalidate sessions.
* **Audit Logging:**  Logging login attempts, account changes, and other security-relevant events for monitoring and incident response.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educating users about phishing, password security, and other social engineering tactics to reduce human error.
* **Security Keys (WebAuthn):**  Supporting WebAuthn based security keys for phishing-resistant authentication.
* **IP Address Restrictions (for self-managed instances):**  Restricting access to GitLab from specific IP ranges or networks.

#### 4.3. Stage 2: Inject Malicious Code

Once an attacker has compromised an account with write access, injecting malicious code into a GitLab repository becomes relatively straightforward.

**Methods of Malicious Code Injection in GitLab:**

* **Direct Commit:** The attacker can directly commit malicious code to a branch they have write access to. This is the most direct and simplest method.
* **Merge Request Manipulation:**  The attacker can create a malicious branch and submit a merge request. If code review processes are weak or bypassed, the malicious code can be merged into the main branch.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Exploitation:**
    * **Modifying `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**  The attacker can modify the CI/CD configuration file to inject malicious steps into the pipeline. This code will be executed on GitLab CI runners.
    * **Injecting Malicious Dependencies:**  If the project uses dependency management (e.g., npm, pip, Maven), the attacker could introduce malicious dependencies or modify dependency resolution to pull in compromised packages.
    * **Manipulating Build Scripts:**  Injecting malicious code into build scripts or scripts executed during the CI/CD process.
* **Web IDE:**  Using GitLab's Web IDE to directly edit files and inject malicious code through the browser interface.
* **Repository Mirroring (Less Direct):**  If repository mirroring is enabled and misconfigured, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code into a mirrored repository that is then pulled into the main GitLab instance (less common for direct injection but a potential supply chain risk).

**Types of Malicious Code and Potential Impact:**

* **Backdoors:**  Code that allows the attacker to regain access to the system or application later, bypassing normal authentication.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Code designed to steal sensitive data from the application, database, or server and transmit it to the attacker.
* **Cryptominers:**  Code that utilizes system resources to mine cryptocurrencies for the attacker, impacting performance and potentially causing instability.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Malicious code injected into libraries or components that are used by other projects, potentially compromising a wider range of systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Code that causes the application or system to become unavailable, disrupting services.
* **Ransomware:**  Code that encrypts data and demands a ransom for its release.
* **Defacement/Reputational Damage:**  Code that modifies the application's appearance or behavior to cause reputational harm.

**GitLab Security Controls to Mitigate Malicious Code Injection:**

* **Branch Protection Rules:**  Restricting direct pushes to protected branches (e.g., `main`, `master`) and requiring merge requests and code reviews.
* **Merge Request Approvals:**  Enforcing code review and approval processes before merge requests can be accepted, ensuring that changes are reviewed by authorized personnel.
* **Code Review Practices:**  Implementing thorough code review processes to identify and prevent malicious or vulnerable code from being merged.
* **CI/CD Security Scanning:**
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Analyzing source code for potential vulnerabilities before deployment. GitLab offers SAST integration.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Testing running applications for vulnerabilities. GitLab offers DAST integration.
    * **Dependency Scanning:**  Identifying vulnerabilities in project dependencies. GitLab offers Dependency Scanning.
    * **Container Scanning:**  Scanning container images for vulnerabilities. GitLab offers Container Scanning.
* **Vulnerability Management:**  Regularly scanning for and patching vulnerabilities in GitLab itself and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Implementing secure coding practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and injection flaws that could be exploited to inject malicious code indirectly.
* **Least Privilege Principle:**  Granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting the potential impact of a compromised account.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identifying security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the GitLab environment.

#### 4.4. Risk Assessment

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack path is considered **Medium to High**.

* **Account Compromise:** Account compromise is a common attack vector, especially with the prevalence of phishing and password reuse. While GitLab offers strong security features like 2FA, user security practices can be weak, and social engineering attacks remain effective.
* **Code Injection:** Once an account is compromised, code injection within GitLab is technically straightforward, making the second stage highly likely if the first stage is successful.

**Impact:**

The impact of this attack path is considered **High to Critical**.

* **Data Breach:** Malicious code can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the repository or accessible by the application.
* **System Compromise:**  Injected code can compromise the GitLab server itself or deployed systems, leading to further attacks and control.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If malicious code is injected into shared libraries or components, it can propagate to downstream users and projects, causing widespread damage.
* **Service Disruption:**  DoS attacks or ransomware can disrupt GitLab services and development workflows.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization using GitLab and erode trust in their software.

**Overall Risk:**  Given the medium to high likelihood and high to critical impact, the overall risk of "Inject Malicious Code into Repository -> Via Compromised Account" is **High**. This attack path should be considered a priority for mitigation.
