    * **Regular Penetration Testing:**  Include injection attack testing in penetration testing activities.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):**  Grant database users only the necessary privileges to minimize the impact of SQL Injection.

#### 4.4. Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. When a user visits a page containing the malicious script, the script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website. In GitLab, XSS vulnerabilities could exist in various user-generated content areas, such as issue descriptions, comments, project names, etc.
* **Impact:** XSS attacks can lead to:
    * **Account Hijacking:**  Stealing session cookies or credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
