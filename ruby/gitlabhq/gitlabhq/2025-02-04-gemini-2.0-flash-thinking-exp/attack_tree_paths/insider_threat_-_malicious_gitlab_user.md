### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Insider Threat - Malicious GitLab User

**Attack Tree Path:** Insider Threat - Malicious GitLab User

*   **Why Critical:** Insiders with legitimate access can bypass many perimeter security controls (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc.) designed to protect against external attackers. They are already authenticated and authorized within the system, making their malicious actions harder to detect and prevent.  The trust placed in insiders allows them to operate with less scrutiny and potentially cause significant damage before detection.

*   **Attack Vectors:** Legitimate access abused for malicious purposes, including data theft, code injection, and sabotage.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

Here's a deeper dive into each attack vector, considering specific GitLab features and potential impacts:

#### 4.1. Data Theft

*   **Description:** A malicious insider with legitimate access aims to exfiltrate sensitive data stored within GitLab. This data could include source code, intellectual property, customer data (if managed within GitLab), secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials), project configurations, and user information.

*   **Specific GitLab Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Repository Cloning/Downloading:**
        *   **Method:**  Using Git commands (e.g., `git clone`, `git pull`) or GitLab's web interface to download repositories they have access to.
        *   **Access Required:**  Read access to the repository. This is often granted to developers, testers, and project managers.
        *   **Impact:**  Loss of confidentiality of source code, intellectual property, and potentially sensitive data embedded within repositories.
    *   **Downloading Artifacts from CI/CD Pipelines:**
        *   **Method:** Accessing and downloading artifacts generated by CI/CD pipelines, which may contain build outputs, reports, or even sensitive data if not properly secured.
        *   **Access Required:**  Access to CI/CD pipelines and artifacts, often granted to developers and operations teams.
        *   **Impact:**  Exposure of build outputs, potentially including compiled code, configuration files, or inadvertently included sensitive data.
    *   **Exporting Projects:**
        *   **Method:** Using GitLab's project export functionality to download a project as an archive, including repositories, issues, merge requests, and other project data.
        *   **Access Required:**  Maintainer or Owner role within the project.
        *   **Impact:**  Bulk data exfiltration of entire projects, including sensitive project metadata and discussions.
