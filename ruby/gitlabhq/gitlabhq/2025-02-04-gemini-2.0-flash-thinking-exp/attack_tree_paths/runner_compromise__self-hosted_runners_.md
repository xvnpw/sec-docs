### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Runner Compromise (Self-Hosted Runners)

#### 4.1. Why Critical:

As highlighted in the attack tree path description, runners are critical components in the CI/CD pipeline. They are responsible for executing jobs defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. This inherently grants them significant privileges and access:

* **Access to Secrets:** Runners often need access to credentials, API keys, and other secrets to deploy applications, interact with cloud providers, or access databases. These secrets are typically defined as CI/CD variables.
* **Access to Internal Networks:** Self-hosted runners are frequently deployed within internal networks to build and deploy applications in private environments. This provides them with network access that external attackers typically lack.
* **Pipeline Manipulation:**  A compromised runner can be used to manipulate the CI/CD pipeline itself. Attackers could inject malicious code into builds, alter deployment processes, or exfiltrate sensitive data from the pipeline.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Due to their network access and potential access to credentials, compromised runners can serve as a pivot point for lateral movement within the internal network, allowing attackers to reach other systems and resources.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors Deep Dive:

##### 4.2.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Runner Software/OS

* **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the GitLab Runner application itself or the underlying operating system on which the runner is running.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **GitLab Runner Application Vulnerabilities:**  Like any software, GitLab Runner can have vulnerabilities. These could include:
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities:** Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the runner host.
        * **Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities:** Allowing attackers to gain elevated privileges on the runner host.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities:** Disrupting the runner's availability.
        * **Authentication/Authorization bypass vulnerabilities:** Allowing unauthorized access to runner functionalities or data.
    * **Operating System Vulnerabilities:** The OS running the runner (e.g., Linux, Windows) is also a potential attack surface. Unpatched OS vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain control of the runner host.
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** GitLab Runner relies on various libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could also be exploited.
* **Exploitation Scenarios:**
    * **Publicly Exposed Runner API:** If the runner API is exposed to the internet (which is generally not recommended but can happen due to misconfiguration), vulnerabilities in the API could be directly exploited.
    * **Job Script Exploitation:**  Malicious actors could attempt to craft malicious job scripts that exploit vulnerabilities in the runner's job execution environment or the underlying OS. This could be achieved through:
        * **Dependency Confusion:** Introducing malicious dependencies that are inadvertently used during job execution.
        * **Exploiting insecure job commands:** Injecting commands that exploit shell vulnerabilities or OS weaknesses.
    * **Network-based Attacks:** If the runner is accessible on the network, attackers could attempt to exploit network-based vulnerabilities in the runner software or OS.
* **Consequences:**
    * **Full Runner Control:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the runner host.
    * **Secret Theft:** Attackers can access secrets stored on the runner or in the runner's environment variables.
    * **Pipeline Manipulation:** Attackers can modify CI/CD pipelines, inject malicious code, or disrupt deployments.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised runner can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the internal network.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular Patching and Updates:**  Keep GitLab Runner and the underlying OS patched with the latest security updates. Subscribe to security advisories for GitLab Runner and the OS.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the runner host and GitLab Runner application for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
    * **Security Hardening:** Harden the runner OS and GitLab Runner installation by following security best practices (e.g., disable unnecessary services, restrict permissions, use firewalls).
    * **Containerized Runners:** Using containerized runners (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) can provide isolation and limit the impact of vulnerabilities. Ensure the container images are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the runner only the necessary permissions and access rights. Avoid running runners with overly permissive accounts.

##### 4.2.2. Misconfiguration of Runner Security Settings

* **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting insecure configurations of the GitLab Runner itself, leading to unauthorized access or control.
* **Common Misconfigurations:**
    * **Insecure Runner Registration Token:** If the runner registration token is compromised or easily guessable, unauthorized runners can be registered, potentially under the attacker's control.
    * **Overly Permissive Runner Configuration (`config.toml`):**  Misconfigurations in the `config.toml` file, such as allowing insecure executors (e.g., `shell` executor without proper isolation), disabling security features, or exposing sensitive information.
    * **Insecure Executor Configuration:**  Even with executors like Docker or Kubernetes, misconfigurations can lead to breakouts or insecure job execution environments. For example, running Docker containers in privileged mode or without proper resource limits.
    * **Exposed Runner API without Authentication:**  If the runner API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, attackers can interact with the runner and potentially execute commands or access sensitive information.
    * **Weak or Default Credentials:** Using default or weak credentials for runner administration or related services.
    * **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:** Lack of adequate logging and monitoring can make it difficult to detect and respond to malicious activity targeting runners.
* **Exploitation Scenarios:**
    * **Unauthorized Runner Registration:** Attackers obtaining a valid registration token can register rogue runners that they control. These runners can then be used to intercept jobs, steal secrets, or inject malicious code.
    * **Runner API Abuse:** If the runner API is exposed and insecurely configured, attackers can directly interact with it to execute commands, access runner status, or potentially manipulate jobs.
    * **Executor Breakouts:** Misconfigured executors, particularly `shell` or Docker executors without proper isolation, can allow attackers to break out of the job execution environment and gain access to the runner host.
    * **Configuration File Manipulation:** If attackers gain access to the runner host (e.g., through OS vulnerabilities), they could modify the `config.toml` file to change runner behavior, disable security features, or steal secrets.
* **Consequences:**
    * **Unauthorized Access and Control:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the runner and potentially control its actions.
    * **Secret Exposure:** Misconfigurations can lead to the exposure of sensitive information stored in the runner configuration or environment.
    * **Pipeline Manipulation:** Compromised runners can be used to manipulate CI/CD pipelines.
    * **Resource Abuse:** Attackers can use compromised runners for resource abuse, such as cryptocurrency mining or launching attacks on other systems.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Runner Registration:** Implement a secure runner registration process. Use strong, randomly generated registration tokens and rotate them regularly. Consider using instance-level or group-level runners to limit scope.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege Configuration:** Configure runners with the principle of least privilege. Only grant necessary permissions and access rights.
    * **Secure Executor Configuration:** Choose secure executors like Docker or Kubernetes and configure them securely. Avoid using `shell` executor in production environments unless absolutely necessary and with strong isolation measures.  Use security profiles (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux) for container executors.
    * **Secure Runner API Access:** If the runner API needs to be accessed, ensure it is properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms. Restrict access to authorized users or systems.
    * **Regular Configuration Review:** Regularly review the runner configuration (`config.toml`) and executor configurations to identify and remediate any misconfigurations.
    * **Robust Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for runners. Monitor runner activity for suspicious behavior and security events.
    * **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to consistently and securely manage runner configurations across multiple runners.

##### 4.2.3. Network Access from Runner to Internal Resources (SSRF potential)

* **Description:** This attack vector exploits the network access that runners often have to internal resources. If not properly controlled, this access can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks or gain unauthorized access to internal systems.
* **Context:** Self-hosted runners are frequently placed within internal networks to build and deploy applications in private environments. This necessitates network connectivity to internal services, databases, and other resources required for CI/CD tasks.
* **SSRF Potential:**
    * **Job Scripts Initiating Outbound Requests:** Job scripts can instruct the runner to make HTTP requests or interact with other network services. If these requests are not properly validated and controlled, attackers can manipulate job scripts to make the runner send requests to internal resources that it should not be able to access directly.
    * **Misconfigured Network Policies:** Overly permissive network policies or firewall rules can allow runners to access a wider range of internal resources than necessary, increasing the potential attack surface for SSRF.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Runner or Job Execution Environment:** Vulnerabilities in the runner software or the job execution environment could be exploited to bypass intended network access controls and perform SSRF attacks.
* **Exploitation Scenarios:**
    * **Accessing Internal Services:** Attackers can use SSRF to access internal web applications, APIs, databases, or other services that are not directly accessible from the internet.
    * **Port Scanning and Service Discovery:** SSRF can be used to scan internal networks and discover open ports and running services, providing valuable reconnaissance information for further attacks.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** SSRF can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from internal systems by making the runner send data to attacker-controlled external servers.
    * **Exploiting Internal Vulnerabilities:** SSRF can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in internal services that are not directly reachable from the internet.
* **Consequences:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive internal systems and data.
    * **Data Breaches:** SSRF can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data from internal networks.
    * **Lateral Movement:** SSRF can be a stepping stone for lateral movement within the internal network, allowing attackers to reach other systems.
    * **Compromise of Internal Services:** SSRF can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in internal services, potentially leading to their compromise.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Network Segmentation and Micro-segmentation:** Segment the network and restrict network access for runners to only the necessary resources. Implement micro-segmentation to further limit the blast radius of a potential compromise.
    * **Least Privilege Network Access:** Grant runners only the minimum necessary network access required for their CI/CD tasks. Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to enforce these restrictions.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization in Job Scripts:**  Carefully validate and sanitize any user-provided input in job scripts that could be used to construct network requests. Prevent job scripts from directly controlling the destination of network requests.
    * **Secure Configuration of Runner Network Settings:** Configure runner network settings to restrict outbound access and prevent unintended connections to internal resources.
    * **Output Validation and Filtering:**  If job scripts need to interact with external services, validate and filter the responses to prevent information leakage or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the runner or job execution environment.
    * **Regular Security Audits of Network Configurations:** Regularly audit network configurations and firewall rules to ensure they are properly configured and enforced for runners.
    * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for Internal Applications:** Deploy WAFs in front of critical internal web applications to protect against SSRF and other web-based attacks, even if they are not directly exposed to the internet.
    * **Monitoring Network Traffic from Runners:** Monitor network traffic originating from runners for suspicious patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
