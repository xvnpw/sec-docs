*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update GitLab to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce strict branch protection rules, requiring code reviews and approvals for sensitive branches.
    *   Carefully configure group and project permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of GitLab configurations and permission settings.
