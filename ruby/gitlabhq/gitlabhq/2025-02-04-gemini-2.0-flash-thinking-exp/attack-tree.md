## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via GitLab Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_gitlab_weaknesses.md)

* **Why Critical:** This is the root goal. Success here means full compromise of the application.
* **Attack Vectors:** All sub-nodes represent attack vectors leading to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Source Code Repository Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_source_code_repository_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Why Critical:** Source code is the blueprint of the application. Access allows attackers to understand vulnerabilities, inject backdoors, and steal sensitive information.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Compromise Git Repository Access Controls
    * Inject Malicious Code into Repository

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Git Repository Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_git_repository_access_controls.md)

* **Why Critical:** Controls access to the source code. Bypassing these controls grants unauthorized access to sensitive code and project history.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Brute-force/Credential Stuffing GitLab User Accounts
    * Social Engineering GitLab Users for Credentials
    * Insider Threat - Malicious GitLab User

## Attack Tree Path: [Insider Threat - Malicious GitLab User](./attack_tree_paths/insider_threat_-_malicious_gitlab_user.md)

* **Why Critical:** Insiders with legitimate access can bypass many security controls and cause significant damage.
* **Attack Vectors:** Legitimate access abused for malicious purposes, including data theft, code injection, and sabotage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Repository](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_repository.md)

* **Why Critical:** Direct injection of malicious code can lead to immediate application compromise, backdoors, and data breaches.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Via Compromised Account
    * Supply Chain Attack via Dependencies (less direct GitLab control, but managed within GitLab projects)
    * Backdoor via Merge Request Manipulation (more subtle code injection)
    * Exploit Git Submodule/Subtree Vulnerabilities (dependency-related injection)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Why Critical:** CI/CD pipelines automate deployment. Compromise allows attackers to inject malicious code into builds and deployments, bypassing traditional security checkpoints.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Pipeline Configuration Manipulation
    * Secrets Exposure in CI/CD
    * Runner Compromise (Self-Hosted Runners)

## Attack Tree Path: [Secrets Exposure in CI/CD](./attack_tree_paths/secrets_exposure_in_cicd.md)

* **Why Critical:** CI/CD pipelines often handle sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords). Exposure of these secrets allows attackers to access external systems, databases, and potentially escalate privileges.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Extract Secrets from CI/CD Variables/Settings
    * Secrets Logging or Accidental Exposure in Pipeline Output
    * Steal Secrets from CI/CD Runner Environment

## Attack Tree Path: [Runner Compromise (Self-Hosted Runners)](./attack_tree_paths/runner_compromise__self-hosted_runners_.md)

* **Why Critical:** Runners execute CI/CD jobs and often have access to internal networks and secrets. Compromising a runner can lead to broader network access, secret theft, and pipeline manipulation.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Runner Software/OS
    * Misconfiguration of Runner Security Settings
    * Network Access from Runner to Internal Resources (SSRF potential)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab User and Access Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_user_and_access_management.md)

* **Why Critical:** User and access management controls who can do what within GitLab. Bypassing or abusing these controls can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and data breaches.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * Privilege Escalation within GitLab
    * Abuse Misconfigured Project/Group Permissions
    * Account Takeover (Beyond Credential Compromise)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Why Critical:** The GitLab API provides programmatic access to GitLab functionality. Exploiting API vulnerabilities can bypass UI-based security and allow for automated attacks and data extraction.
* **Attack Vectors**:
    * API Authentication/Authorization Bypass
    * API Injection Vulnerabilities
    * Information Disclosure via API Endpoints

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Git Repository Access Controls -> Brute-force/Credential Stuffing GitLab User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_git_repository_access_controls_-_brute-forcecredential_stuffing_gitlab_user_accounts.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Brute-force and credential stuffing are common attacks, especially if users have weak passwords or MFA is not enforced. Success grants direct access to the source code repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Git Repository Access Controls -> Social Engineering GitLab Users for Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_git_repository_access_controls_-_social_engineering_gitlab_users_for_credentials.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** Social engineering exploits human vulnerabilities, often bypassing technical security controls. Phishing and pretexting can be effective in obtaining GitLab credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Git Repository Access Controls -> Insider Threat - Malicious GitLab User](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_git_repository_access_controls_-_insider_threat_-_malicious_gitlab_user.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** Insider threats are difficult to prevent and detect. Malicious insiders already have legitimate access and can cause significant damage with minimal effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Repository -> Via Compromised Account](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_repository_-_via_compromised_account.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Once an account with write access is compromised, injecting malicious code is straightforward and can have immediate and severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Pipeline Configuration Manipulation -> Modify `.gitlab-ci.yml` via Compromised Account](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_pipeline_configuration_manipulation_-_modify___gitlab-ci_yml_c812b047.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Compromised accounts can be used to modify pipeline configurations, injecting malicious steps into the deployment process. This can lead to backdoored applications being deployed automatically.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Pipeline Configuration Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Stages/Jobs into Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_pipeline_configuration_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_stage_cdd76bb5.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** Directly manipulating the pipeline configuration to inject malicious stages or jobs is a powerful attack vector, allowing for code execution and deployment control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Secrets Exposure in CI/CD -> Extract Secrets from CI/CD Variables/Settings -> Insufficient Access Control to CI/CD Settings](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_secrets_exposure_in_cicd_-_extract_secrets_from_cicd_variabl_b61a45ed.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Insufficient access controls to CI/CD settings are a common misconfiguration. If secrets are stored in CI/CD variables and access is not properly restricted, attackers can easily extract them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Secrets Exposure in CI/CD -> Secrets Logging or Accidental Exposure in Pipeline Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_secrets_exposure_in_cicd_-_secrets_logging_or_accidental_exp_0c6ba4ca.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Developers often accidentally log secrets or expose them in pipeline output during debugging or misconfiguration. This makes secrets readily available to anyone who can access pipeline logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Runner Compromise (Self-Hosted Runners) -> Misconfiguration of Runner Security Settings](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_runner_compromise__self-hosted_runners__-_misconfiguration_o_c27ab1f7.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** Self-hosted runners, if misconfigured, can be vulnerable to compromise. Weak security settings can allow attackers to gain control of the runner and the CI/CD environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities -> Runner Compromise (Self-Hosted Runners) -> Network Access from Runner to Internal Resources (SSRF potential)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities_-_runner_compromise__self-hosted_runners__-_network_access_fro_eb368e1a.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** Runners with excessive network access can be exploited to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, potentially gaining access to internal resources and services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab Issue Tracking/Project Management -> Information Disclosure via Issue Visibility/Access Controls -> Accessing Sensitive Information in Publicly Accessible Issues (Misconfiguration)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_issue_trackingproject_management_-_information_disclosure_via_issue_visibilityaccess__179ff7dc.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Misconfigured issue visibility settings can accidentally expose sensitive information in publicly accessible issues. This is a common misconfiguration, especially in large projects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab Issue Tracking/Project Management -> Information Disclosure via Issue Visibility/Access Controls -> Leaking Sensitive Data via Issue Descriptions/Attachments](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_issue_trackingproject_management_-_information_disclosure_via_issue_visibilityaccess__c52ac9b7.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** User error in pasting sensitive data into issue descriptions or attaching sensitive files is a common cause of data leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab User and Access Management -> Abuse Misconfigured Project/Group Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_user_and_access_management_-_abuse_misconfigured_projectgroup_permissions.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Misconfigured project or group permissions can grant unintended access to sensitive repositories and project resources. This is a common issue in organizations with complex permission structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab API Vulnerabilities -> Information Disclosure via API Endpoints -> Accessing Sensitive Data via Unprotected API Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_api_vulnerabilities_-_information_disclosure_via_api_endpoints_-_accessing_sensitive__fcd599d6.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Unprotected or poorly secured API endpoints can expose sensitive data without proper authentication or authorization. API exploration can reveal these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab Integrations (If Used) -> Misconfiguration of GitLab Integrations -> Overly Permissive Integration Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_integrations__if_used__-_misconfiguration_of_gitlab_integrations_-_overly_permissive__5370bddb.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Overly permissive integration configurations can grant external systems excessive access to GitLab resources, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GitLab Integrations (If Used) -> Data Leakage via Integrations -> Sensitive Data Exposed through Integration Channels (e.g., Slack notifications)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitlab_integrations__if_used__-_data_leakage_via_integrations_-_sensitive_data_exposed_throu_7f2abb28.md)

* **Why High-Risk:**  Sensitive data can be inadvertently leaked through integration channels like Slack notifications if proper data handling and filtering are not implemented.
