# Threat Model Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Threat: [Unauthorized Code Modification](./threats/unauthorized_code_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a GitLab repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in GitLab itself) and modifies the source code. This could involve introducing backdoors, vulnerabilities, or malicious logic.

**Impact:**  Compromised application functionality, introduction of security vulnerabilities, potential data breaches, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Git repository (managed by GitLab), branches (managed by GitLab), commits (managed by GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong access controls and permissions on repositories within GitLab.
*   Utilize branch protection rules within GitLab to restrict direct pushes to critical branches.
*   Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all GitLab users.
*   Regularly audit user permissions and access within GitLab.
*   Monitor repository activity within GitLab for suspicious changes.

## Threat: [Secret Exposure in Repository](./threats/secret_exposure_in_repository.md)

**Description:** Developers accidentally commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials) directly into a Git repository hosted on GitLab. Attackers can scan public or private GitLab repositories for these secrets.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, infrastructure compromise.

**Affected Component:** Git repository (managed by GitLab), commits (managed by GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of committing secrets to GitLab.
*   Implement pre-commit hooks or Git hooks to prevent committing secrets to GitLab.
*   Utilize GitLab's Secret Detection feature to identify and prevent secret leaks.
*   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) instead of storing secrets in GitLab repositories.
*   Regularly scan GitLab repository history for accidentally committed secrets and revoke them.

## Threat: [Malicious Pipeline Execution](./threats/malicious_pipeline_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., through a compromised account or a vulnerability in GitLab) and injects malicious steps into the build or deployment process. This could involve deploying backdoors, exfiltrating data, or compromising infrastructure.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised application versions, infrastructure compromise, data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration (managed by GitLab), CI/CD pipelines (executed by GitLab), CI/CD jobs (executed by GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with strict access controls within GitLab.
*   Implement code review for changes to the CI/CD configuration within GitLab.
*   Use templating and include files for CI/CD configurations within GitLab to enforce consistency and security.
*   Restrict access to CI/CD variables and secrets within GitLab.

## Threat: [Compromised CI/CD Runner](./threats/compromised_cicd_runner.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a GitLab CI/CD runner machine. This allows them to intercept secrets managed by GitLab, modify build artifacts managed by GitLab, or gain access to the environment where the runner operates.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, deployment of malicious code, potential access to infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** CI/CD runners (managed by GitLab), runner configuration (managed by GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden GitLab CI/CD runner machines and keep them updated with security patches.
*   Isolate GitLab CI/CD runners in secure network segments.
*   Use ephemeral runners (e.g., using Docker or Kubernetes) that are destroyed after each job initiated by GitLab.
*   Regularly audit runner configurations and access within GitLab.
*   Securely manage runner registration tokens within GitLab.

## Threat: [Account Takeover](./threats/account_takeover.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a GitLab user account through weak passwords, phishing, or credential stuffing targeting GitLab accounts.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized code modifications, access to sensitive information within GitLab, manipulation of CI/CD pipelines, potential for further lateral movement within the GitLab instance.

**Affected Component:** User accounts (managed by GitLab), authentication module (within GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration) within GitLab.
*   Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all GitLab users.
*   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts to GitLab.
*   Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks targeting GitLab.
*   Monitor login activity to GitLab for suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Compromised Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](./threats/compromised_personal_access_tokens__pats_.md)

**Description:** Attackers obtain valid Personal Access Tokens (PATs) issued by GitLab users or applications to interact with the GitLab API.

**Impact:**  Ability to perform actions on behalf of the token owner within GitLab, potentially including code access, CI/CD manipulation, and data retrieval from GitLab.

**Affected Component:** Personal Access Tokens (managed by GitLab), API authentication (within GitLab).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Educate users about the importance of securely storing and managing GitLab PATs.
*   Implement short expiration times for GitLab PATs.
*   Scope GitLab PATs to the minimum necessary permissions.
*   Regularly audit and revoke unused or suspicious GitLab PATs.
*   Consider using more secure authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 with GitLab where appropriate.

## Threat: [Exploitation of GitLab Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_gitlab_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the GitLab application itself (e.g., through unpatched versions).

**Impact:**  Full compromise of the GitLab instance, access to all data and resources managed by GitLab, potential for further attacks on connected systems.

**Affected Component:** GitLab application (various modules and functions depending on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the GitLab instance up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
*   Subscribe to GitLab security announcements and advisories.
*   Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address GitLab vulnerabilities promptly.
*   Harden the GitLab server infrastructure according to security best practices.
