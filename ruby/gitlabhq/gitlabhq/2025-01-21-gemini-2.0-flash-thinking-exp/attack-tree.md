## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Compromised Commit](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_compromised_commit.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Account
    *   Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's GitLab account.
    *   Methods:
        *   Phishing Attack Targeting Developer Credentials: Deceiving the developer into revealing their username and password through fake login pages or emails.
        *   Exploiting Weak Developer Password: Guessing or cracking a developer's easily guessable password.
        *   Social Engineering Developer: Manipulating a developer into revealing their credentials or granting access.
*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code via Compromised Commit
    *   Description: Using the compromised developer account, the attacker commits malicious code directly into the repository.
    *   Methods:
        *   Modifying existing files to include backdoors or vulnerabilities.
        *   Adding new files containing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Backdoor via Merge Request Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_backdoor_via_merge_request_manipulation.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise Approver Account
    *   Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user account with merge request approval privileges.
    *   Methods:
        *   Phishing Attack Targeting Approver Credentials: Similar to phishing developers, but targeting users with approval rights.
        *   Exploiting Weak Approver Password: Guessing or cracking the password of an approver.
        *   Social Engineering Approver: Manipulating an approver into approving a malicious merge request without proper scrutiny.
*   Attack Vector: Introduce Backdoor via Merge Request Manipulation
    *   Description: The attacker submits a merge request containing malicious code and, using the compromised approver account, approves and merges it into the main branch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into CI/CD Configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_cicd_configuration___gitlab-ci_yml_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise Account with CI/CD Configuration Write Access
    *   Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to an account with permissions to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
    *   Methods:
        *   Phishing Attack Targeting Relevant Credentials: Targeting users responsible for managing the CI/CD configuration.
        *   Exploiting Weak Password: Guessing or cracking the password of a user with CI/CD write access.
        *   Social Engineering: Manipulating a user with CI/CD write access into making malicious changes.
*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code into CI/CD Configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml)
    *   Description: The attacker modifies the CI/CD configuration file to introduce malicious steps into the build or deployment process.
    *   Methods:
        *   Adding scripts that download and execute malicious code.
        *   Modifying build steps to include vulnerable dependencies or malicious components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Runner](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_runner.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise CI/CD Runner
    *   Description: An attacker gains control over a CI/CD runner instance.
    *   Methods:
        *   Exploiting Vulnerability in Runner Software: Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the GitLab Runner software.
        *   Gain Unauthorized Access to Runner Infrastructure: Compromising the underlying infrastructure where the runner is hosted (e.g., virtual machine, container).

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate CI/CD Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_cicd_artifacts.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code into Build Artifacts
    *   Description: The attacker modifies the build artifacts generated by the CI/CD pipeline to include malicious code.
    *   Methods:
        *   Injecting code into compiled binaries or scripts.
        *   Adding malicious libraries or dependencies to the artifact.
*   Attack Vector: Replace Legitimate Artifacts with Malicious Ones
    *   Description: The attacker replaces the legitimate build artifacts with pre-built malicious artifacts.
    *   Methods:
        *   Gaining access to the artifact storage location and overwriting files.
