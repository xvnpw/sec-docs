#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Compromise Account with CI/CD Configuration Write Access

**Description:** This initial stage of the attack focuses on gaining unauthorized access to a GitLab account that possesses the necessary permissions to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This is a critical prerequisite for the subsequent injection of malicious code.

**Methods:**

*   **Phishing Attack Targeting Relevant Credentials:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages designed to trick users with CI/CD write access into revealing their login credentials (username and password). These emails often mimic legitimate GitLab communications or target specific roles like DevOps engineers or release managers.
    *   **Technical Details:** Phishing emails might contain links to fake login pages that steal credentials, or attachments containing malware that can compromise the user's machine and steal stored credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Successful phishing grants the attacker direct access to the targeted GitLab account.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about phishing tactics and how to identify suspicious emails.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all GitLab accounts, especially those with elevated privileges. This adds an extra layer of security even if credentials are compromised.
        *   **Email Security Solutions:** Implement email filtering and anti-phishing tools to detect and block malicious emails.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review user permissions and access levels to ensure only necessary individuals have CI/CD write access.

*   **Exploiting Weak Password:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess or crack the password of a user with CI/CD write access. This can be done through brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or by leveraging known password leaks.
    *   **Technical Details:** Attackers might use automated tools to try common passwords or variations of usernames. They might also obtain password hashes from compromised databases and attempt to crack them offline.
    *   **Impact:** Successful password cracking grants the attacker direct access to the targeted GitLab account.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity, character types) and regularly prompt users to change passwords.
        *   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Password Monitoring Tools:** Utilize tools that monitor for compromised credentials and alert users to change their passwords if their information is found in a data breach.
        *   **MFA (as mentioned above):** Significantly reduces the risk even with a weak password.

*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate individuals with CI/CD write access into performing actions that compromise their accounts or directly modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This could involve impersonating a colleague, a system administrator, or a trusted third party.
    *   **Technical Details:** This attack relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits. Attackers might request password resets under false pretenses or convince users to execute malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to credential disclosure or direct modification of CI/CD configurations.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Security Awareness Training (specifically on social engineering):** Educate users about common social engineering tactics and how to verify the identity of individuals making requests.
        *   **Clear Communication Channels:** Establish clear procedures for making changes to CI/CD configurations and emphasize the importance of verifying requests through official channels.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users. Avoid granting broad CI/CD write access unless absolutely required.
        *   **Code Review Processes:** Implement mandatory code reviews for changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to catch suspicious modifications.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code into CI/CD Configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml)

**Description:** Once the attacker has gained access to an account with the necessary permissions, the next step is to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to introduce malicious code. This code will be executed during the CI/CD pipeline, potentially compromising the build environment, deployment targets, or sensitive data.

**Methods:**

*   **Adding scripts that download and execute malicious code:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker inserts commands into the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that instruct the CI/CD runner to download a malicious script from an external source and execute it. This script can perform various malicious actions.
    *   **Technical Details:** The added script might use commands like `wget`, `curl`, or `powershell` to download the malicious payload. The payload could be a reverse shell, a data exfiltration tool, or ransomware.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CI/CD runner environment, potential compromise of deployment targets, data breaches, and supply chain attacks.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation on any external URLs or commands used within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
        *   **Restricting External Network Access:** Limit the CI/CD runner's ability to access external networks. If external access is necessary, use a whitelist of allowed domains.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for CI/CD:** If applicable, implement CSP-like mechanisms to restrict the sources from which the CI/CD runner can load resources.
        *   **Regular Review of `.gitlab-ci.yml` Changes:** Implement a process for reviewing all changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, ideally through code review and version control.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure for CI/CD Runners:** Use ephemeral CI/CD runners that are destroyed after each job, limiting the persistence of any injected malware.

*   **Modifying build steps to include vulnerable dependencies or malicious components:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker alters the build process defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to introduce vulnerable dependencies or directly include malicious components in the application build.
    *   **Technical Details:** This could involve changing dependency versions to known vulnerable ones, adding malicious packages to dependency management files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`), or injecting malicious code directly into build scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application, potential backdoors, and supply chain compromise affecting users of the application.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement tools that automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and alert developers.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Utilize SCA tools to identify and manage open-source components and their associated risks.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin specific versions of dependencies in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and dependency management files to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure Supply Chain Practices:** Implement measures to verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Build Processes:** Review the build steps defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to identify any suspicious or unnecessary actions.
