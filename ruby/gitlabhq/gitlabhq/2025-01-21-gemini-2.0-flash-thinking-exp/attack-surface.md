# Attack Surface Analysis for gitlabhq/gitlabhq

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in User Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_user_content.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab renders user-generated content (issues, merge requests, comments, wiki pages) which can contain unsanitized HTML or JavaScript.

**Example:** A user crafts a comment in a merge request containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views the comment, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content. Utilize GitLab's built-in features for Markdown and HTML rendering with security in mind. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. Regularly update GitLab to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_webhooks.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external services.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab allows users to configure webhooks that trigger HTTP requests to specified URLs upon certain events. If not properly validated, these URLs can be manipulated.

**Example:** An attacker configures a webhook for a project that, upon a push event, sends a request to an internal network resource (e.g., `http://internal-server/admin`).

**Impact:** Access to internal services, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of webhook URLs. Restrict the schemes and ports allowed for webhook targets. Consider using a dedicated service for handling outbound requests from GitLab.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how GitLab authenticates API requests or authorizes access to resources.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab provides a comprehensive API for interacting with its features. Flaws in the API's authentication mechanisms (e.g., personal access tokens, OAuth) or authorization logic can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API that allows them to access or modify resources belonging to another user without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to repositories, modification of project settings, account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Enforce strong API key management practices, including regular rotation and secure storage. Utilize GitLab's built-in permission system for granular access control to API endpoints. Implement proper input validation and rate limiting for API requests. Regularly review and audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [CI/CD Pipeline Manipulation and Secrets Exposure](./attack_surfaces/cicd_pipeline_manipulation_and_secrets_exposure.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify CI/CD configurations to execute malicious code or gain access to sensitive information stored as secrets.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab's CI/CD feature allows users to define automated workflows in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. If these files are not properly secured or secrets are mishandled, vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a repository and modifies the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to exfiltrate environment variables containing database credentials.

**Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of infrastructure, supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement protected branches to restrict who can modify `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. Utilize GitLab's CI/CD features for secret variable masking and secure file handling. Regularly review CI/CD configurations for potential vulnerabilities. Employ secure coding practices in CI/CD scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Git Protocol Exploits (SSH and HTTP(S))](./attack_surfaces/git_protocol_exploits__ssh_and_http_s__.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying Git protocol or its implementation within GitLab.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab handles Git operations (push, pull, clone) over SSH and HTTP(S). Exploits in the `git-upload-pack` or `git-receive-pack` processes, or in the handling of large objects, can be targeted.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in `git-upload-pack` during a `git clone` operation, leading to remote code execution on the GitLab server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the GitLab server, denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Keep GitLab and its underlying Git binaries up-to-date with the latest security patches. Implement resource limits and security hardening for Git operations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization in Background Jobs (Sidekiq)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_in_background_jobs__sidekiq_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the application, leads to arbitrary code execution.

**How GitLab Contributes:** GitLab uses Sidekiq for processing background jobs. If job arguments contain serialized data from untrusted sources without proper validation, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when processed by a Sidekiq job, executes arbitrary commands on the GitLab server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the GitLab server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of serialized data before deserialization. Use secure serialization formats. Regularly update GitLab and its dependencies.
