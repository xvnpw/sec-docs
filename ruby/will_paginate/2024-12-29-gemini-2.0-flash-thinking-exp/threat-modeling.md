*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in `per_page` Parameter
    *   **Description:** An attacker could supply an excessively large integer value for the `per_page` parameter. This would cause `will_paginate` to instruct the underlying data retrieval mechanism (e.g., database query) to fetch an extremely large number of records. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating URL parameters.
    *   **Impact:**  Significant performance degradation on the server due to the large data retrieval initiated by `will_paginate`. Potential for memory exhaustion on the application server, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `will_paginate`'s logic for determining the number of items to fetch based on the `per_page` parameter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on the `per_page` parameter *before* it reaches `will_paginate`, enforcing a reasonable maximum value.
        *   Configure `will_paginate` with a maximum allowed `per_page` value if such an option exists (check the gem's documentation).

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Large `per_page`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could repeatedly request pages with the maximum allowed `per_page` value. This could strain the database and application server resources over time, even if individual requests don't cause immediate crashes. `will_paginate` would facilitate these large data retrieval requests. The attacker might use automated scripts to send numerous such requests.
    *   **Impact:**  Gradual degradation of application performance, potential for temporary service unavailability, and increased infrastructure costs due to resource consumption caused by `will_paginate`'s handling of large `per_page` values.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The interaction between `will_paginate` and the data retrieval mechanism, specifically the retrieval of a large number of records as dictated by `will_paginate`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on pagination requests *before* they are processed by `will_paginate`.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity related to pagination requests.
        *   Consider implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the data source for frequently accessed pages.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Link Parameters
    *   **Description:** If `will_paginate`'s default link generation or customization options are used in a way that embeds sensitive information directly into the pagination links (e.g., internal IDs, user-specific tokens), an attacker could potentially extract this information by inspecting the URLs generated by the gem.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `will_paginate`'s link generation logic and customization options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review how `will_paginate` generates links and avoid embedding sensitive information directly.
        *   Use opaque identifiers or indirect references instead of exposing internal details in the URLs generated by `will_paginate`.
        *   If sensitive data must be included in pagination-related data, ensure it's handled securely outside of the direct link parameters.
