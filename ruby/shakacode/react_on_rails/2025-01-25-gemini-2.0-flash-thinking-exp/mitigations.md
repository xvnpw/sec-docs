# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Data Rendered on the Server](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_data_rendered_on_the_server.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Content in SSR:**  Locate all instances in your server-rendered React components (within Rails views or controllers) where dynamic data is passed as props.
    2.  **Choose Rails Sanitization:** Utilize Rails' built-in sanitization helpers like `ERB::Util.html_escape` or `sanitize` method.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization in Rails Views/Controllers:**  Sanitize dynamic data *before* passing it to React components during server-side rendering in your Rails views or controllers.
    4.  **Test SSR Output:** Inspect the HTML output of server-rendered components to ensure dynamic data is properly sanitized and escaped, preventing potential XSS.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Side Rendering - High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious scripts through server-rendered content, a risk specifically heightened by SSR in `react_on_rails`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via SSR - High Reduction:** Effectively mitigates server-side XSS vulnerabilities arising from dynamic content in SSR components.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Partially implemented in Rails views where server-side rendering occurs (e.g., `app/views/pages/index.html.erb`).
    *   **Status:** Sanitization is used for some user-generated content, but may not be consistently applied to all dynamic data sources in SSR components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Consistent application of sanitization to *all* dynamic data rendered server-side, especially data fetched from APIs and used in SSR components. Need to review all SSR rendering points.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Manage Server-Side Secrets and Credentials (SSR Context)](./mitigation_strategies/securely_manage_server-side_secrets_and_credentials__ssr_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify SSR Secret Exposure Points:** Recognize that secrets could be inadvertently exposed in the initial HTML payload during server-side rendering if not handled carefully.
    2.  **Avoid Embedding Secrets in SSR Components:**  Do not directly embed sensitive server-side secrets or API keys within React components that are rendered on the server.
    3.  **Client-Side Fetching for Secrets:**  Fetch sensitive data client-side *after* initial rendering, or use secure server-side session management and authorization to control access.
    4.  **Environment Variables for Secrets:**  Store secrets as environment variables and access them securely in your Rails backend, avoiding hardcoding in the application code, especially SSR components.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Server-Side Secrets in Initial HTML Payload - High Severity:** Prevents accidental leakage of secrets within the HTML source code generated by SSR, a specific risk in `react_on_rails` SSR.
