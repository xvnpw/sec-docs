# Attack Surface Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SSR](./attack_surfaces/server-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into server-rendered HTML, leading to script execution on the server during the rendering process.
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` enables Server-Side Rendering (SSR) of React components. If user-provided or untrusted data is directly embedded into React components during SSR without proper sanitization, it creates a **direct** entry point for server-side XSS due to the SSR mechanism facilitated by `react_on_rails`.
*   **Example:** A blog application using `react_on_rails` renders user comments server-side. If a comment contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and is not sanitized before being rendered by the React component on the server, this script could execute on the server during the SSR process. This might lead to server-side information leakage or manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, information disclosure, denial of service, potential for further attacks on backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data and data from untrusted sources *before* rendering it in React components on the server.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Employ context-aware output encoding when rendering data in React components server-side.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit script sources.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion during SSR](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_during_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious requests designed to consume excessive server resources during Server-Side Rendering, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails`'s architecture relies on Node.js for SSR.  Complex React components or inefficient data handling during SSR, *within the `react_on_rails` context*, can be resource-intensive and exploitable for DoS.
*   **Example:** An e-commerce application using `react_on_rails` renders product pages server-side. If a product page component is poorly optimized and involves heavy computations during SSR, an attacker could send a flood of requests for such pages, overwhelming the Node.js SSR server.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Optimize React Components for SSR Performance:** Profile and optimize React components to minimize SSR resource usage.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit incoming requests to prevent overwhelming the SSR server.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching for server-rendered HTML.
    *   **Resource Limits for Node.js SSR Process:** Configure resource limits for the Node.js SSR process.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via SSR Errors](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_ssr_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is exposed through error messages, logs, or debugging outputs generated during Server-Side Rendering.
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** The integration of Node.js and Rails by `react_on_rails` for SSR creates a specific context where errors during SSR, or data transfer between Rails and Node.js, can expose sensitive details if error handling is not carefully managed *within the `react_on_rails` setup*.
*   **Example:** During SSR, a database connection error occurs in the Rails backend, and this error message, including database connection strings, is propagated to the Node.js SSR process and inadvertently logged or displayed in a generic error page.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration details, internal paths, code snippets.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in React components and the Node.js SSR environment. Avoid displaying detailed errors in production.
    *   **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:** Use secure centralized logging, redact sensitive information in logs.
    *   **Custom Error Pages:** Implement user-friendly custom error pages without technical details.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side XSS Amplified by Hydration](./attack_surfaces/client-side_xss_amplified_by_hydration.md)

*   **Description:** Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the hydration process if server-rendered HTML contains unsanitized data.
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` utilizes hydration. If server-rendered HTML, intended for initial display, contains unsanitized data, the hydration process, *a core feature of `react_on_rails`*, can trigger malicious script execution when React takes over client-side control.
*   **Example:** A user profile page rendered with `react_on_rails` displays a user's "bio" field. Flawed server-side sanitization allows `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` in the HTML. Hydration might execute this script when React mounts.
*   **Impact:** Client-side account compromise, session hijacking, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consistent Sanitization:** Ensure consistent and robust sanitization both server-side and client-side.
    *   **Strict Client-Side Sanitization:** Implement strong client-side sanitization in React components.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct security testing for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Initial Props/State](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_initial_propsstate.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is inadvertently included in the initial props or Redux state passed from Rails backend to React frontend during SSR.
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails`'s data passing mechanism from Rails to React for SSR and hydration is the direct context. Unintentional inclusion of sensitive data in this transfer, *facilitated by `react_on_rails`*, creates exposure.
*   **Example:** An application passes user profile data, including sensitive fields like email address, as initial props to a React component during SSR. This data becomes visible in the page source.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations, potential account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Data Transfer:** Only transfer necessary data from backend to frontend for initial rendering.
    *   **Data Filtering and Transformation:** Filter and transform backend data to remove or mask sensitive information before frontend transfer.
    *   **Secure Data Handling in Frontend:** Handle sensitive data securely in the frontend, avoid unnecessary logging or display.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `react_on_rails` Gem and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__react_on_rails__gem_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the `react_on_rails` gem itself or its dependencies (Ruby gems and JavaScript packages).
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:**  Using `react_on_rails` introduces dependencies on the `react_on_rails` gem and its ecosystem. Vulnerabilities in these *specific* dependencies directly impact applications using `react_on_rails`.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the `react_on_rails` gem or a core dependency like `webpacker`. Applications using the vulnerable version are at risk.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep `react_on_rails` and all dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Periodically audit dependencies for security.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Node.js SSR Environment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_node_js_ssr_environment.md)

*   **Description:** The Node.js environment used for SSR is not securely configured.
*   **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` *requires* a Node.js environment for SSR. The security of this *specific* Node.js environment, integral to `react_on_rails` functionality, is crucial and directly impacts the application's security.
*   **Example:** The Node.js SSR process runs with excessive privileges, or unnecessary services are enabled on the SSR server, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Node.js Security Hardening:** Apply security hardening practices to the Node.js SSR environment (least privilege, disable unnecessary services, updates, etc.).
    *   **Regular Security Audits of SSR Environment:** Audit the security configuration of the Node.js SSR environment.
    *   **Monitoring and Intrusion Detection:** Implement monitoring for suspicious activity in the SSR environment.
