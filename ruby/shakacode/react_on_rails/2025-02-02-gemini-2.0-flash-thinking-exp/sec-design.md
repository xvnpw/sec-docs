# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the 'react_on_rails' GitHub repository, aims to facilitate the integration of React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with Ruby on Rails, a widely-used web application framework. The primary business goal is to enhance the user experience and development efficiency of web applications built with Ruby on Rails by leveraging the component-based architecture and rich ecosystem of React.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): React enables building dynamic, interactive, and responsive user interfaces, leading to improved user engagement and satisfaction.
- Increase Development Velocity and Efficiency: React's component reusability and vibrant community can accelerate front-end development and reduce development costs.
- Modernize Technology Stack: Adopting React allows organizations to modernize their Rails applications with a contemporary front-end technology, attracting and retaining skilled developers.
- Maintainability and Scalability: Component-based architecture of React promotes code modularity, making applications easier to maintain and scale.

Business Risks:
- Integration Complexity: Integrating two distinct frameworks (Rails and React) can introduce complexity in development, deployment, and maintenance.
- Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies: Relying on external JavaScript packages (npm ecosystem) can introduce supply chain risks and potential security vulnerabilities.
- Skill Gap: Developers need to be proficient in both Ruby on Rails and React, potentially requiring training or hiring new talent.
- Performance Overhead: Incorrect integration or inefficient React code can lead to performance bottlenecks in the application.
- Increased Attack Surface: Introducing a JavaScript-heavy frontend might expose new attack vectors if not properly secured.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Ruby on Rails framework incorporates several built-in security features, including protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection. These are documented in the official Rails Security Guide.
- security control: Dependency management using Bundler for Ruby gems and npm/yarn for JavaScript packages helps in tracking and managing dependencies, although vulnerability scanning might not be automatically enabled.
- security control: Web application firewalls (WAFs) might be in place at the infrastructure level to protect against common web attacks.
- security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing might be conducted on the overall infrastructure and applications, but specific focus on 'react_on_rails' integration might be lacking.
- security control: Secure coding practices are generally followed by development teams, including input validation and output encoding, but might not be consistently applied across both Rails and React codebases.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript libraries used in the React frontend, with reliance on community-driven updates and manual vulnerability scanning.
- accepted risk: Complexity of managing security configurations across both Rails backend and React frontend, potentially leading to misconfigurations.
- accepted risk:  Performance impact of certain security measures on the React frontend, potentially leading to trade-offs between security and user experience.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning for both Ruby gems and npm/yarn packages in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to analyze both Rails and React code for security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks in the React frontend.
- security control: Regularly update both Ruby gems and npm/yarn packages to patch security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct specific security reviews and penetration testing focused on the 'react_on_rails' integration points and potential attack vectors introduced by the React frontend.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing the application, leveraging Rails authentication mechanisms like Devise or similar.
    - requirement: Ensure consistent authentication context is maintained between the Rails backend and the React frontend, especially for API interactions.
    - requirement: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged user accounts.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict user access to specific features and data based on roles and permissions, enforced in the Rails backend.
    - requirement: Ensure authorization checks are consistently applied to API endpoints accessed by the React frontend.
    - requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to users and applications.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs on both the React frontend and the Rails backend to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.).
    - requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them on the frontend to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Implement robust error handling and input validation error messages that do not reveal sensitive information.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Securely store sensitive data at rest, such as user credentials and personal information, using appropriate encryption techniques in the database.
    - requirement: Implement secure session management and cookie handling to prevent session hijacking and other session-related attacks.
    - requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for all cryptographic operations.

2. Code commit triggers a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.
3. Dependency Scan step analyzes project dependencies (Ruby gems and npm/yarn packages) for known vulnerabilities using tools like Bundler Audit and npm audit.
4. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) step analyzes the source code (both Rails and React) for potential security vulnerabilities using SAST tools.
5. Build Backend step builds the Rails backend application, including asset compilation and dependency management using Bundler.
6. Build Frontend step builds the React frontend application, including bundling JavaScript, CSS, and other assets using tools like Webpack and Yarn/npm.
7. Containerize step packages the built application and its dependencies into a Docker container image.
8. Artifact Store step pushes the Docker container image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
9. Deployment step deploys the container image from the artifact store to the target deployment environment (e.g., cloud platform).
