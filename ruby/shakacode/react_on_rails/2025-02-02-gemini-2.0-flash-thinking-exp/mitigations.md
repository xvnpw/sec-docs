# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Server-Side Rendered Data](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_server-side_rendered_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify SSR Data Points:**  Focus on data passed from your Rails backend to React components specifically for server-side rendering via `react_on_rails`. This includes props passed during initial rendering and data injected into the HTML.
    2.  **Sanitize in Rails Backend:** Implement sanitization logic *within your Rails application* before data is passed to `react_on_rails` for rendering. This ensures data is safe *before* it even reaches the React rendering process.
        *   Use Rails' built-in sanitization helpers or dedicated libraries like `rails-html-sanitizer` for HTML content.
        *   For simple text, ensure proper encoding to prevent XSS.
    3.  **React Component Awareness:**  While React inherently escapes text in JSX, be extra cautious when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in components that receive server-rendered data. Server-side sanitization is crucial in these cases.
    4.  **Test SSR Sanitization:**  Write tests in your Rails backend to verify that data passed to `react_on_rails` is correctly sanitized before rendering. These tests should simulate various types of potentially malicious input.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High (Specifically related to server-rendered content in React on Rails)
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS Mitigation: High - Directly prevents XSS vulnerabilities that can arise from unsanitized data being rendered server-side by `react_on_rails` and injected into the initial HTML.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in: Project X - Rails backend controllers and serializers used with `react_on_rails`.
    *   Location: Sanitization logic is applied in Rails controllers and serializer methods that prepare data for `react_on_rails` rendering.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Some older Rails serializers used with legacy `react_on_rails` components might lack proper sanitization. These need to be audited and updated to ensure consistent server-side sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request Timeouts for SSR (React on Rails Context)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_timeouts_for_ssr__react_on_rails_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Node.js SSR Server:**  `react_on_rails` relies on a Node.js server (or similar environment) to perform server-side rendering. Configure request timeouts within this Node.js server setup.
    2.  **Set Timeout Value:** Determine an appropriate timeout duration for SSR requests. This should account for typical rendering times of your React components within the `react_on_rails` context, but also be short enough to prevent resource exhaustion.
    3.  **Handle Timeouts Gracefully:**  Implement error handling in your Node.js server to catch timeout events during SSR. When a timeout occurs, ensure the server responds with an error (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable) and logs the event. This prevents the server from hanging indefinitely.
    4.  **Monitor SSR Performance:**  Monitor the frequency of SSR timeouts.  An increase in timeouts could indicate performance issues in your React components or potential DoS attempts targeting the `react_on_rails` SSR process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: High (Resource exhaustion specifically during `react_on_rails` server-side rendering)
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS Mitigation: Medium - Prevents resource exhaustion on the server caused by excessively long `react_on_rails` SSR requests. Limits the impact of DoS attempts targeting SSR.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in: Project X - Node.js server configured for `react_on_rails` SSR.
    *   Location: Request timeout is set in the Node.js server's configuration for handling `react_on_rails` SSR requests.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Timeout value is currently static.  Consider implementing dynamic timeout adjustments based on server load or the complexity of the React component being rendered by `react_on_rails`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Token Inclusion in AJAX Requests (React on Rails Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_token_inclusion_in_ajax_requests__react_on_rails_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify React on Rails CSRF Setup:** Confirm that `react_on_rails` is correctly configured to pass the Rails CSRF token to the client-side React application. This typically involves `react_on_rails` rendering a meta tag containing the CSRF token in the initial HTML.
    2.  **Access Token in React:**  Ensure your React application has a mechanism to reliably access the CSRF token from the meta tag rendered by `react_on_rails`. Create a utility function or hook for this purpose.
    3.  **AJAX Configuration for CSRF:** Configure your chosen AJAX library (e.g., `axios`, `fetch`) within your React application to automatically include the CSRF token in the `X-CSRF-Token` header for all requests made to your Rails backend.
    4.  **Rails Backend CSRF Verification:**  Ensure that CSRF protection is enabled and correctly configured in your Rails application. Rails should automatically verify the `X-CSRF-Token` header on incoming requests.
    5.  **Integration Testing:**  Write integration tests that specifically verify that AJAX requests originating from your `react_on_rails` application to the Rails backend are correctly protected by CSRF tokens and that requests without valid tokens are rejected by Rails.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Severity: High (Specifically in the context of React frontend interacting with Rails backend in `react_on_rails`)
*   **Impact:**
    *   CSRF Mitigation: High - Effectively prevents CSRF attacks against actions performed via AJAX requests from the React frontend to the Rails backend within the `react_on_rails` application.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in: Project X - React frontend, `react_on_rails` configuration, and Rails backend.
    *   Location: `react_on_rails` handles initial token passing. React application uses a utility function to access the token and `axios` is configured to include it in headers. Rails CSRF protection is active.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: No known missing implementation. However, regular audits should be performed to ensure that CSRF protection remains correctly configured and functional as the `react_on_rails` application evolves and new features are added. Specifically, when new AJAX request patterns are introduced, CSRF protection should be re-verified.
