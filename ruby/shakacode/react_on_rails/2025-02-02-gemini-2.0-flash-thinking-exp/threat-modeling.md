# Threat Model Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SS-XSS) via SSR](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ss-xss__via_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled data. When this data is rendered by React components on the server during SSR, the injected script executes on the server. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on the server's behalf, such as accessing internal resources, making requests to other services (SSRF), or disclosing sensitive server-side information.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure.
*   **Affected React on Rails Component:** React components used in server-side rendering, specifically the data passed to these components from Rails controllers or helpers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data on the server-side *before* passing it to React components for SSR.
    *   Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for escaping and sanitizing output within components.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS.
    *   Regularly audit React components used in SSR for potential injection points and data handling vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets during SSR](./threats/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_during_ssr.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers accidentally pass sensitive server-side information, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal paths, to React components during SSR. This information becomes embedded in the HTML source code sent to the client, making it accessible to anyone viewing the page source.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of backend systems, unauthorized access to APIs or databases.
*   **Affected React on Rails Component:**  Rails controllers, helpers, or initializers that pass data to React components for SSR, specifically the data structures and variables used to transfer data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review all data passed from Rails to React for SSR, ensuring no sensitive information is included unintentionally.
    *   Avoid directly passing environment variables or sensitive configuration to React components during SSR.
    *   Use secure configuration management practices and avoid hardcoding secrets in the application code.
    *   Implement mechanisms to filter or redact sensitive data before passing it to the frontend.

## Threat: [Compromised Node.js Dependencies in Build Pipeline](./threats/compromised_node_js_dependencies_in_build_pipeline.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers compromise a Node.js package used as a dependency in the JavaScript build pipeline (e.g., Webpack, Babel, npm modules). This compromised dependency can inject malicious code into the application's JavaScript assets during the build process.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain attack, malicious code injection into frontend assets, potential compromise of user browsers, data theft, defacement.
*   **Affected React on Rails Component:**  Node.js build pipeline (Webpack configuration, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`/`package-lock.json`), and the resulting JavaScript assets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Node.js dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Node.js packages.
    *   Utilize dependency lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates.
    *   Minimize the number of dependencies and carefully evaluate the trustworthiness and maintainability of each dependency before adding it.
    *   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager to control and vet dependencies.
