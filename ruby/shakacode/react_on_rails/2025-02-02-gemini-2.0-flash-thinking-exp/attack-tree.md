## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (JSX Injection) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious JSX/JS Code during SSR [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker aims to inject malicious JavaScript or JSX code that gets executed on the server during the SSR process.
            *   **Unsanitized User Input Rendered in JSX on Server [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The primary attack vector is through user-controlled data that is directly embedded into JSX templates without proper sanitization.
                *   **User-controlled data directly embedded into JSX templates without proper escaping during SSR [CRITICAL NODE]:**  This is the most granular attack step. Attackers manipulate inputs like query parameters or form data to inject malicious code into the JSX rendered on the server. When the server renders this JSX, the injected code is executed server-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Passing Mechanisms between Rails and React [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_passing_mechanisms_between_rails_and_react__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Client-Side Injection via Server-Rendered Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious Client-Side Code through Server Data [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker aims to inject malicious client-side code by manipulating data that is passed from the server to the client-side React application during SSR.
            *   **Unsanitized Server-Rendered Props/Data Attributes [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attack vector is through server-rendered data (props or data attributes) that is not properly sanitized before being sent to the client.
                *   **Data passed from Rails to React as props or data attributes during SSR is not properly sanitized, leading to client-side XSS when React renders it [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the core vulnerability. If server-side data is not correctly escaped or encoded before being rendered as React props or data attributes, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript. When React renders this data on the client-side, the injected code will be executed in the user's browser, leading to client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in React on Rails Gem/Ecosystem [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_react_on_rails_gemecosystem__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the React on Rails application.
        *   **Outdated React on Rails Gem [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Using an outdated version of the `react_on_rails` gem with known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**  If the application uses an old version of the `react_on_rails` gem that has known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities directly.
        *   **Vulnerable JavaScript/Node.js Dependencies (via npm/yarn) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Vulnerabilities in JavaScript packages used by React on Rails for SSR or asset management (e.g., Node.js modules used in build process) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  React on Rails relies on JavaScript dependencies for SSR and asset management. If these JavaScript packages have vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them. This can lead to various issues, including code execution on the server or client, and supply chain attacks if compromised packages are distributed.

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown highlight the most critical security concerns specific to React on Rails applications. Addressing these high-risk paths and critical nodes should be the top priority for securing applications built with this framework.
