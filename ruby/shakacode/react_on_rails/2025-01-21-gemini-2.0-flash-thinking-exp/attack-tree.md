## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via React on Rails Weaknesses (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_react_on_rails_weaknesses__critical_.md)

Attacker's overarching goal to exploit vulnerabilities specifically introduced by the `react_on_rails` gem to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Attacker targets weaknesses in the process where the Rails backend renders React components on the server. Successful exploitation here can lead to direct code execution or information leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Code via SSR (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_code_via_ssr__critical_.md)

Attacker aims to inject malicious code (typically JavaScript) into the HTML generated during server-side rendering. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized Props Passed to React Components (OR) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_props_passed_to_react_components__or___critical_.md)

Attacker manipulates data passed from the Rails backend to React components as props. If this data isn't properly sanitized on the server-side, malicious HTML or JavaScript code can be injected. When the server renders the component, this malicious code will be included in the initial HTML response, leading to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerabilities in SSR Dependencies (OR) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__vulnerabilities_in_ssr_dependencies__or___critical_.md)

The server-side rendering process might rely on specific JavaScript runtimes or libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them during the rendering process to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JavaScript Asset Management (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_javascript_asset_management__critical_.md)

Attacker targets the mechanisms used to manage and serve JavaScript files required by the React frontend. Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of malicious code on the client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious JavaScript Assets (OR) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_javascript_assets__or___critical_.md)

Attacker finds a way to introduce malicious JavaScript files into the application's asset pipeline. These files are then served to users and executed in their browsers, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. This often requires compromising the deployment pipeline or gaining unauthorized server access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise the Asset Pipeline (OR) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_the_asset_pipeline__or___critical_.md)

Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Rails asset pipeline configuration or storage. This allows them to directly modify or replace legitimate JavaScript files with malicious ones, leading to persistent client-side compromise for all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependencies of JavaScript Assets (OR) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependencies_of_javascript_assets__or___critical_.md)

React applications rely on numerous third-party JavaScript libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code within the user's browser. This is a common attack vector if dependencies are not regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities.
