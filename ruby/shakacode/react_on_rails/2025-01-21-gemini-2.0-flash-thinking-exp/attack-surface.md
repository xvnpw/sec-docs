# Attack Surface Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side JavaScript Injection (SSJS)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_javascript_injection__ssjs_.md)

**Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the server-side rendering process, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` enables server-side rendering of React components using Node.js. If user-provided data is directly incorporated into the props passed to the server-side rendering function without proper sanitization, it can be interpreted as executable JavaScript.

**Example:**  A user provides input like `<img src=x onerror=alert('hacked')>` which is then passed as a prop and rendered server-side using a method like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This could execute the `alert('hacked')` code on the server during the rendering process.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data before passing it as props to server-rendered components. Use libraries specifically designed for sanitizing HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on Server:**  Minimize or avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for server-side rendering, especially with user-provided data. If necessary, ensure extremely rigorous sanitization.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the server can load scripts, mitigating the impact of successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets via Props](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_via_props.md)

**Description:** Sensitive server-side configuration or secrets are inadvertently passed as props to React components during server-side rendering, making them visible in the initial HTML source code.

**How `react_on_rails` Contributes:**  The mechanism of passing props from the Rails backend to the React frontend during server-side rendering can lead to accidental exposure if developers are not careful about what data they include.

**Example:**  An API key or database password is mistakenly included in the props passed to a component rendered on the server. This key will be present in the HTML source sent to the client.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, and potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only pass the necessary data to the frontend. Avoid passing sensitive information through props intended for client-side use.
*   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables and access them securely on the server. Do not directly pass them as props.
*   **Careful Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code where props are being passed during server-side rendering to ensure no sensitive data is included.

## Attack Surface: [Node.js Dependencies and Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/node_js_dependencies_and_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Node.js environment or its dependencies used for server-side rendering can be exploited to compromise the server.

**How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` relies on Node.js for its server-side rendering functionality, inheriting the security risks associated with the Node.js ecosystem and its dependencies.

**Example:**  A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a Node.js package used by the application for server-side rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Server compromise, denial of service, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Node.js and all its dependencies (including those managed by `npm` or `yarn`) up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for Node.js and its ecosystem.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Rendered Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-rendered_data.md)

**Description:**  Even with server-side rendering, if data passed from the Rails backend to the React components is not properly sanitized before being rendered on the client-side, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**How `react_on_rails` Contributes:**  While `react_on_rails` handles the initial rendering on the server, the final output is still interpreted by the client's browser. If unsanitized data is included in the server-rendered HTML, it can execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.

**Example:** User-generated content from the database is passed as a prop and rendered server-side. If this content contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed when the browser interprets the HTML.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Encode data based on the context in which it will be used (HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL encoding, etc.).
*   **Use React's Built-in Escaping:** React automatically escapes values rendered within JSX, which helps prevent many XSS vulnerabilities. However, be cautious with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
*   **Sanitize User Input on the Server:** Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in the database to prevent persistent XSS.
