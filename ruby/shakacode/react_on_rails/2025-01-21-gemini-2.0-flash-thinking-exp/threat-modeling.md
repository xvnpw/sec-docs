# Threat Model Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-side_rendering__ssr_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is passed from the Rails backend to React components for server-side rendering. If this data is not properly sanitized or escaped by `react_on_rails` or the developer using it, the malicious script will be rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.

**Affected Component:** `react_on_rails`'s `server_render` helper and the React components rendered server-side, particularly where user-provided or external data is involved and not correctly handled by `react_on_rails`'s rendering process or developer implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust output encoding on the server-side *within the Rails application before passing data to `react_on_rails` for rendering*.
*   Ensure that the React components used in server-side rendering are designed to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, even if they receive unsanitized data (though relying solely on this is not recommended).
*   Sanitize user-provided data on the backend *before* passing it to the frontend via `react_on_rails`.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Prop Handling](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_prop_handling.md)

**Description:** If data passed as props from the Rails backend to React components *via `react_on_rails`'s `react_component` helper* is not properly handled on the client-side, particularly when rendering dynamic content, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. This is especially relevant when using functions like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized prop data originating from the Rails backend.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Affected Component:** React components receiving props from `react_component` and the way these props are used in rendering. The vulnerability arises from how the developer uses the data passed by `react_on_rails`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize or escape data received as props *within the React component* before rendering it, especially when using functions like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
*   Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS.
*   Enforce secure coding practices within React components that receive data passed by `react_on_rails`.

## Threat: [Security Misconfiguration by Exposing Sensitive Rails Helpers to JavaScript](./threats/security_misconfiguration_by_exposing_sensitive_rails_helpers_to_javascript.md)

**Description:** `react_on_rails` allows exposing Rails helpers to the JavaScript environment. If sensitive or powerful helpers are exposed without careful consideration in the `react_on_rails` configuration, they could be misused by malicious client-side code (e.g., through an XSS vulnerability) or by a compromised frontend, allowing attackers to perform actions they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized actions on the server-side, information disclosure, or other security breaches depending on the functionality of the exposed helper. This directly stems from a configuration option provided by `react_on_rails`.

**Affected Component:** The `react_on_rails` configuration for exposing Rails helpers.

**Risk Severity:** High (if powerful or sensitive helpers are exposed).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review the security implications before exposing any Rails helpers to the JavaScript environment using `react_on_rails`'s configuration.
*   Only expose helpers that are absolutely necessary for the frontend functionality.
*   Ensure that exposed helpers do not perform sensitive actions without proper authorization checks on the server-side, regardless of how they are called from the frontend.
