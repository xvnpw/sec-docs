# Attack Surface Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) JavaScript Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__javascript_injection.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that gets executed on the server during the rendering process.
* **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` facilitates server-side rendering of React components. If data passed from Rails to the React component for SSR is not properly sanitized, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript on the server.
* **Example:** A user provides input like `<img src="x" onerror="require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /')">` which is passed to a React component for server-side rendering without sanitization. This could lead to command execution on the server.
* **Impact:** Critical. Allows for remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Server-Side Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data on the Rails backend before passing it to React components for server-side rendering. Use libraries specifically designed for sanitization.
    * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Ensure data is properly encoded based on the context where it's being used in the React component during SSR.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Node.js process used for SSR with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection leading to Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_leading_to_client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:** Malicious data injected from the Rails backend into the React frontend, which is then rendered without proper escaping, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
* **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** `react_on_rails` is the bridge for passing data from the Rails backend to the React frontend (e.g., through props or initial data). If this data is not sanitized on the server-side, it can be exploited on the client-side.
* **Example:** A blog post title containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` is fetched from the Rails backend and passed as a prop to a React component. The component renders this title directly, causing the script to execute in the user's browser.
* **Impact:** High. Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Server-Side Output Encoding:** Encode data on the Rails backend before sending it to the React frontend. This ensures that special characters are rendered safely in the browser.
    * **Contextual Escaping in React:** Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS, such as using JSX correctly and avoiding direct rendering of unsanitized HTML.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets during SSR](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_during_ssr.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, environment variables) intended for server-side use is inadvertently exposed in the HTML rendered by the server.
* **How `react_on_rails` Contributes:** If React components used for SSR are not carefully designed, they might accidentally include or log sensitive information that ends up in the rendered HTML.
* **Example:** A React component logs an API key during its server-side rendering lifecycle, and this log message is included in the HTML response.
* **Impact:** High. Exposed secrets can be used to compromise other systems or gain unauthorized access.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Careful Component Design:** Ensure React components used for SSR do not directly access or log sensitive information that should remain server-side.
    * **Environment Variable Management:** Use secure methods for managing and accessing environment variables, ensuring they are not inadvertently exposed during rendering.
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and prevent the accidental inclusion of sensitive information in server-rendered output.
