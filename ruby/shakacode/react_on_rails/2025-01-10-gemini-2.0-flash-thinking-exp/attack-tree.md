## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application (react_on_rails Specific) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application__react_on_rails_specific___critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes contributes to achieving this goal.
* **Attack Vectors:** All the attack vectors detailed below represent ways to compromise the application specifically due to its use of `react_on_rails`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how `react_on_rails` handles server-side rendering of React components.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious Code via Server-Rendered Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** The Rails backend fails to properly sanitize or escape data before passing it as props or data to React components for server-side rendering.
        * **Mechanism:** An attacker provides malicious input that, when rendered on the server, injects script tags or malicious attributes into the HTML sent to the client.
        * **Impact:** Leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement strict output encoding and sanitization of all dynamic data within the Rails backend before it's passed to React for SSR. Use secure templating practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Client-Side Rendering (CSR) & Hydration Issues Introduced by react_on_rails](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_client-side_rendering__csr__&_hydration_issues_introduced_by_react_on_rails.md)

* This path targets vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between server-rendered HTML and the client-side React application during hydration.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Inconsistencies Between Server and Client Rendering [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
        * **Description:** Differences in how data is interpreted or rendered on the server versus the client-side React application after hydration.
        * **Mechanism:** An attacker crafts input that renders harmlessly on the server but, due to different parsing or rendering logic on the client, results in the execution of malicious JavaScript after hydration.
        * **Impact:** Leads to client-side XSS vulnerabilities, similar to the SSR attack vector, allowing for malicious script execution in the user's browser.
        * **Mitigation:** Ensure consistent data handling, escaping, and rendering logic between the server-side rendering process and the client-side React application. Thoroughly test rendering with various input types.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Weaknesses in the react_on_rails Configuration or Setup [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_weaknesses_in_the_react_on_rails_configuration_or_setup__high-risk_path_start___critical__a3e109e5.md)

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities stemming from insecure configuration or setup of the `react_on_rails` integration.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Leverage Insecure Defaults or Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** Developers fail to configure `react_on_rails` securely, leaving default settings or making common misconfiguration mistakes.
        * **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit known insecure default settings or common misconfigurations that expose sensitive information, allow unauthorized access, or create pathways for other attacks. Examples include exposing debugging endpoints or using insecure data passing methods.
        * **Impact:** Can lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or create stepping stones for more severe attacks.
        * **Mitigation:** Carefully review the `react_on_rails` documentation and follow security best practices during setup and configuration. Regularly audit the configuration for potential weaknesses.
    * **Exploit Dependencies of react_on_rails [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the Ruby gems or Node.js packages that `react_on_rails` depends on.
        * **Mechanism:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by `react_on_rails`. This can be done through automated tools or by researching known vulnerabilities.
        * **Impact:** Can lead to a wide range of security issues, including arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement a robust dependency management strategy. Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
