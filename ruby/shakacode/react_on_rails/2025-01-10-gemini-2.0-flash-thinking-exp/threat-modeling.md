# Threat Model Analysis for shakacode/react_on_rails

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Rendered Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-rendered_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is then rendered server-side by React through `react_on_rails`. This code executes in the victim's browser when the initial HTML is loaded. The attacker might manipulate input fields or exploit vulnerabilities in data sources.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and other client-side attacks.

**Affected react_on_rails Component:** `react_component` helper, server-rendering process. Specifically, the way props are passed to the React component for server-side rendering.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize all user-provided data before passing it as props to `react_component`.
- Use a templating engine or library that automatically escapes HTML entities.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Component Injection](./threats/server-side_component_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the parameters or logic that determine which React component is rendered server-side by `react_on_rails`. This could involve influencing the arguments passed to the `react_component` helper.

**Impact:** Rendering of unintended components, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing unexpected application behavior. In severe cases, it could lead to remote code execution if the injected component has vulnerabilities.

**Affected react_on_rails Component:** `react_component` helper, the application's routing logic that determines which component to render.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Strictly control and validate the input used to determine which component to render.
- Avoid relying on user-provided data to directly select components.
- Implement robust authorization checks before rendering specific components.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Server State through Props](./threats/exposure_of_internal_server_state_through_props.md)

**Description:** `react_on_rails` inadvertently exposes internal server-side state or configuration details by including them in the props passed to React components.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially revealing database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive internal information.

**Affected react_on_rails Component:** `react_component` helper, the logic that prepares and serializes props on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Carefully review the data being passed as props to React components.
- Implement strict filtering to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive server-side information.
- Avoid passing configuration details directly as props.

## Threat: [Webpack Configuration Vulnerabilities Leading to Code Injection](./threats/webpack_configuration_vulnerabilities_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Description:** Insecure Webpack configurations used in conjunction with `react_on_rails` allow attackers to inject malicious code during the build process. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in loaders or plugins.

**Impact:** Code injection, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server or client. Supply chain attacks by compromising build dependencies.

**Affected react_on_rails Component:** The integration with the asset pipeline and Webpack configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Thoroughly review and secure the Webpack configuration.
- Use trusted and well-maintained Webpack loaders and plugins.
- Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for assets.
- Regularly audit and update Webpack dependencies.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Injection Amplified by Server-Side Rendering](./threats/client-side_logic_injection_amplified_by_server-side_rendering.md)

**Description:** While the core vulnerability is client-side, the server-side rendering provided by `react_on_rails` can amplify the impact. If server-rendered components include unsanitized user-controlled data that is later used in client-side JavaScript logic, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Client-side XSS, manipulation of application behavior after the initial render.

**Affected react_on_rails Component:** `react_component` helper, the process of hydrating the client-side React application with server-rendered markup.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize user-provided data before rendering it on the server and before using it in client-side logic.
- Ensure consistent sanitization practices across both server and client.
