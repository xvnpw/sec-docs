## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

This entire path is considered high-risk due to the inherent dangers of executing JavaScript on the server, a core feature of SSR.

*   **Node.js Vulnerabilities in ExecJS Context {CRITICAL}**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Node.js runtime environment used by ExecJS for server-side rendering.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in specific Node.js versions.
        *   These vulnerabilities can allow for arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   Often, exploits are publicly available, making this a low-effort attack.
    *   **Specific Attack:**
        *   **Outdated Node.js Version {CRITICAL}**:
            *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated Node.js version with known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
            *   **Mitigation:** *Crucially*, keep the Node.js version up-to-date. Use a version manager (nvm, asdf) and regularly check for security updates. Use dependency checkers (npm audit, yarn audit).

*   **React Component Injection [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into React components during the server-side rendering process.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Attackers manipulate input data to inject malicious JavaScript.
        *   If this data is not properly sanitized *before* being used in SSR, the injected code will execute on the server.
    *   **Specific Attack:**
        *   **XSS via Server-Rendered Content {CRITICAL}**:
            *   **Description:** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being passed to React components for server-side rendering, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
            *   **Impact:** Server-side code execution, leading to potential data exfiltration, server compromise, and further attacks.
            *   **Mitigation:** *Strictly* sanitize all user-supplied data *before* it is used in server-side rendering. Use a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify on the server, if possible, or a Rails-specific sanitization helper). *Never* trust user input. Consider a Content Security Policy (CSP). Sanitize *before* data hits the React component on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues.md)

* **Specific Attack:**
    *   **Leaked API Keys in Config Files {CRITICAL}**:
        *   **Description:** Sensitive API keys or other credentials are hardcoded in `react_on_rails` configuration files, which are then accidentally exposed (e.g., committed to a public repository).
        *   **Impact:** Direct access to the services protected by those API keys, potentially leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
        *   **Mitigation:** *Never* hardcode sensitive credentials in configuration files. Use environment variables. Use a gem like `dotenv-rails` in development. In production, use your hosting provider's mechanism for setting environment variables (Heroku config vars, AWS Parameter Store, etc.).
