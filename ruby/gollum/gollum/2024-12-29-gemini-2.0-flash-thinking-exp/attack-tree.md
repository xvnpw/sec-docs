**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Content Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

*   **Inject Malicious Content:** Attackers aim to insert harmful code or scripts into the wiki content.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown/HTML (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code within the Markdown or HTML content of a Gollum page. When a user views this page, their browser executes the malicious script.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, defacing the wiki.
    *   **Abuse File Upload Functionality (if enabled/integrated) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If Gollum or the application allows file uploads, an attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a web shell, an executable). They then attempt to access this file directly or through another vulnerability to execute it on the server.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control.

**Exploit Git Repository Access (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

*   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Git Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers attempt to gain direct access to the underlying Git repository that stores the wiki content.
    *   **Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization on Git Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weak or default credentials (usernames and passwords) configured for the Git repository. They might also exploit misconfigured access controls that grant unauthorized users read or write access.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Access to all wiki content, including potentially sensitive information. If write access is gained, attackers can modify content or inject malicious code.
*   **Inject Malicious Content via Git (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers with write access to the Git repository directly manipulate the repository content.
    *   **Commit Malicious Code/Files (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with write access commits malicious code or files directly to the Git repository. This could include backdoors, scripts designed to exploit other vulnerabilities, or modified application code if the repository is used for more than just wiki content.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution when the application pulls or uses the malicious content from the repository.

**Exploit Gollum-Specific Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

*   **Exploit Known Gollum Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers target publicly known security flaws within the Gollum application itself.
    *   **Utilize Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly available information about vulnerabilities in specific versions of Gollum (often documented with CVE identifiers). They use exploits or techniques to trigger these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or other forms of compromise.

*   **Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:** Attackers target insecure settings or configurations within Gollum.
    *   **Insecure Gollum Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigured Gollum settings, such as allowing unsafe markup languages (e.g., allowing raw HTML without proper sanitization), disabling security features, or using default or weak administrative credentials for Gollum itself (if applicable).
        *   **Potential Impact:** Increased attack surface, enabling other vulnerabilities like XSS or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Exploit Integration Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

*   **Abuse Application's Interaction with Gollum:** Attackers target vulnerabilities arising from how the main application interacts with the Gollum instance.
    *   **Session Hijacking/Fixation in Gollum Context (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application doesn't properly manage user sessions when interacting with Gollum, attackers might be able to steal a valid user's session cookie or force a user to use a session ID controlled by the attacker.
        *   **Potential Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate user and perform actions on their behalf within the Gollum wiki.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) against Gollum Actions (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks an authenticated user into making unintended requests to the Gollum application. This is typically done by embedding malicious links or scripts on other websites or through email.
        *   **Potential Impact:** The attacker can perform actions within the Gollum wiki as the authenticated user, such as modifying or deleting pages.
