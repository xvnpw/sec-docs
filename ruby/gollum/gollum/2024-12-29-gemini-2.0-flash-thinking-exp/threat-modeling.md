Here is the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving Gollum:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection via Markdown/Markup
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to a Gollum page injects malicious Markdown or other supported markup (e.g., HTML if enabled). This directly leverages Gollum's rendering capabilities to embed `<script>` tags for arbitrary JavaScript execution in other users' browsers, inject iframes for redirection, or manipulate the page's appearance for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or actions performed on behalf of the victim. Defacement of the wiki. Redirection of users to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rendering Engine (specifically the Markdown or other markup parser and renderer within Gollum).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization within Gollum's rendering pipeline for all user-provided content. Use context-aware escaping techniques specific to the output format (HTML).
        *   Disable or strictly control features within Gollum's configuration that allow embedding raw HTML or JavaScript (if supported by the chosen markup engine).
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web application hosting Gollum to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks originating from Gollum content.

*   **Threat:** Git Repository Manipulation leading to Content Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains write access to the underlying Git repository (either through compromised credentials *or vulnerabilities in Gollum's Git interaction logic*) directly modifies the Git history. This exploits Gollum's reliance on Git for content storage and versioning, allowing attackers to alter existing content, delete pages, or introduce malicious content that will be rendered by Gollum.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity within the Gollum wiki, introduction of misinformation, potential for serving malicious content to users through the compromised wiki, disruption of the wiki's intended purpose.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gollum's Git Interaction Logic (the core modules within Gollum responsible for reading and writing to the Git repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on the Git repository, ensuring only authorized users and the Gollum application (with minimal necessary permissions) have write access. Secure the credentials used by Gollum to access the repository.
        *   Regularly back up the Git repository to allow for recovery from malicious modifications introduced through or bypassing Gollum.
        *   Implement auditing and logging of Git operations performed *by Gollum* to detect unauthorized changes originating from the application.
        *   Consider using signed commits to verify the authenticity of changes, although this requires infrastructure beyond Gollum itself.

*   **Threat:** Git Command Injection (if Gollum improperly handles Git commands)
    *   **Description:** If Gollum's codebase constructs and executes Git commands based on user input or internal state without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to inject arbitrary Git commands. This directly exploits Gollum's interaction with the Git command-line interface. This is more likely in custom extensions or if Gollum's core logic has vulnerabilities in how it calls Git.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Git repository managed by Gollum, potential for arbitrary code execution on the server if the Gollum process has sufficient privileges to execute the injected commands with elevated permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gollum's Git Interaction Logic (specifically the functions within Gollum that execute Git commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing Git commands directly from user input within Gollum's code. Use parameterized commands or Git libraries that provide safe abstractions to interact with Git.
        *   If direct command execution is absolutely necessary within Gollum, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious commands.
        *   Run the Gollum process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.

*   **Threat:** Access Control Bypass in Gollum's Authorization Logic
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Gollum's own access control mechanisms could allow unauthorized users to view or edit pages they should not have access to. This directly involves flaws in how Gollum manages and enforces permissions for wiki pages.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the Gollum wiki, potential for unauthorized modification or deletion of content by users who should not have the necessary privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gollum's Authorization Module (the components within Gollum responsible for managing and enforcing access permissions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test Gollum's access control implementation, paying close attention to how permissions are checked and enforced for different actions (viewing, editing, etc.).
        *   Ensure that access controls are consistently enforced across all functionalities provided by Gollum.
        *   Regularly update Gollum to benefit from security patches that address potential access control vulnerabilities within the application itself.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Includes/Code Execution via Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If Gollum is configured to use a markup engine (beyond basic Markdown) with known vulnerabilities related to server-side includes or code execution, an attacker could inject malicious markup that gets executed on the server when Gollum renders the page. This directly exploits vulnerabilities in the rendering engine integrated with Gollum.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches affecting the server hosting Gollum, denial of service by crashing the Gollum process or the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rendering Engine (specifically the parser and interpreter for the chosen markup language integrated within Gollum).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and regularly updated markup engines with Gollum. Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in the chosen engine.
        *   Disable or carefully control features within the rendering engine's configuration that allow embedding server-side code or includes.
        *   Implement strong security practices for the server environment hosting Gollum as a defense-in-depth measure.
