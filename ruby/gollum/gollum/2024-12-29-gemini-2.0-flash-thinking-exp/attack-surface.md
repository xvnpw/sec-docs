Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Gollum, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Wiki Markup
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript or other client-side scripts are injected into wiki pages and executed by other users' browsers when they view those pages.
    *   **How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum renders user-provided content in various markup languages (Markdown, Textile, etc.). If these are not properly sanitized during rendering, injected scripts can be executed.
    *   **Example:** A user edits a page and includes `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the Markdown content. When another user views this page, the alert box pops up, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. More malicious scripts could steal cookies or redirect users.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of wiki pages, redirection to malicious websites, potentially gaining access to sensitive information within the user's browser context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Sanitization/Output Encoding: Implement robust server-side sanitization of user-provided markup before rendering it. Use libraries specifically designed for this purpose for each supported markup language. Encode output appropriately for the HTML context.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious File Upload
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., executable files, web shells) through the Gollum interface, which can then be executed on the server or used to compromise user systems.
    *   **How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum allows users to upload files as attachments or images within wiki pages. If file type and content are not properly validated, malicious files can be uploaded.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the server allows execution of PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can access this shell and execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, server compromise, data breach, defacement of the wiki, potential compromise of other systems on the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict File Type Validation: Implement server-side validation to ensure only allowed file types are accepted. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
        *   Content Verification: Go beyond file extensions and use techniques like magic number verification to identify the true file type.
        *   Antivirus/Malware Scanning: Integrate antivirus or malware scanning tools to scan uploaded files for malicious content.
        *   Secure File Storage: Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server for execution. Consider using a separate storage service.
        *   Restrict Execution Permissions: Ensure that the directory where uploaded files are stored does not have execute permissions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Information via Git History
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, internal configurations) is accidentally committed to the underlying Git repository and becomes accessible through Gollum's interface.
    *   **How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum directly interacts with a Git repository. If sensitive data is present in the repository's history, Gollum can potentially expose this information when displaying page history or diffs.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a file containing database credentials to the Git repository. This information becomes visible in the page history within Gollum.
    *   **Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized access to systems and services, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Git Practices: Educate developers on secure Git practices, including avoiding committing sensitive information.
        *   .gitignore: Utilize `.gitignore` files to prevent sensitive files from being added to the repository in the first place.
        *   Credential Management: Use secure credential management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables) instead of hardcoding secrets.
        *   History Rewriting (with caution): If sensitive information is accidentally committed, use tools like `git filter-branch` or `git rebase` to rewrite the repository history and remove the sensitive data. This should be done with extreme caution and proper planning as it can have significant consequences for collaborators.
        *   Access Control: Implement appropriate access controls on the Git repository itself to limit who can view the history.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** Gollum's default configuration settings might be less secure than recommended, leaving the application vulnerable to known exploits or misconfigurations.
    *   **How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum has various configuration options that, if not set correctly, can introduce security risks.
    *   **Example:** Leaving default administrative credentials unchanged or having overly permissive access controls enabled by default.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, potential compromise of the Gollum instance and the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Default Configuration: Ensure that the default configuration settings are as secure as possible.
        *   Configuration Hardening Guide: Provide a clear and comprehensive guide for users on how to securely configure their Gollum instance, including recommendations for strong passwords, access controls, and other security-related settings.
        *   Regular Configuration Review: Periodically review the Gollum configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.
