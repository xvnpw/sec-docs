## Deep Analysis of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown/Markup in Gollum

This document provides a deep analysis of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack surface within applications utilizing the Gollum wiki system, specifically focusing on the injection of malicious scripts through Markdown and other supported markup languages.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the mechanisms by which Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be introduced and exploited within a Gollum-based application through the use of malicious Markdown or other markup. This includes:

*   Understanding the specific ways Gollum's rendering process can be leveraged for XSS attacks.
*   Identifying the key areas within Gollum's architecture and code that contribute to this vulnerability.
*   Providing a comprehensive overview of potential attack vectors and their impact.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and suggesting further improvements.
*   Equipping the development team with the knowledge necessary to implement robust defenses against this attack surface.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on the following aspects of the XSS vulnerability via malicious Markdown/Markup in Gollum:

*   **Gollum's Rendering Engine:**  We will analyze how Gollum processes and renders different markup formats (Markdown, Textile, etc.) and how this process can lead to the execution of injected scripts.
*   **User-Provided Content:** The analysis will concentrate on the risks associated with rendering content directly provided by users, including wiki page content, comments (if enabled), and potentially other user-generated data that is processed by Gollum's rendering engine.
*   **Client-Side Execution:** The focus is on XSS attacks that execute malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser when they view a page containing the injected script.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested mitigation strategies (server-side sanitization, output encoding, CSP) and explore additional preventative measures.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Other potential attack vectors against the Gollum application (e.g., SQL injection, authentication bypass, CSRF) unless they are directly related to the XSS vulnerability being analyzed.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying Ruby environment or web server hosting Gollum, unless they directly impact the XSS vulnerability.
*   Third-party plugins or extensions for Gollum, unless explicitly mentioned and relevant to the core rendering process.

### 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed for this deep analysis:

*   **Code Review:**  We will review the relevant sections of the Gollum codebase, particularly the rendering pipeline for different markup languages. This includes examining how user input is processed, sanitized (or not), and ultimately rendered into HTML.
*   **Attack Simulation:** We will simulate various XSS attack scenarios by crafting malicious Markdown/Markup payloads and observing how Gollum handles them. This will involve testing different markup formats and injection points.
*   **Documentation Analysis:** We will review the official Gollum documentation and any relevant security advisories to understand the intended behavior and any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Best Practices Review:** We will compare Gollum's current handling of user input and output with established security best practices for XSS prevention, such as those outlined by OWASP.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will critically assess the proposed mitigation strategies, considering their effectiveness, potential drawbacks, and ease of implementation.
*   **Tooling:** We may utilize security testing tools and browser developer consoles to analyze the rendered HTML and identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis of XSS via Malicious Markdown/Markup

Gollum's core strength lies in its ability to render various markup languages into HTML for display. However, this functionality becomes a significant attack surface when user-provided content is not properly sanitized before rendering. The fundamental issue is that markup languages like Markdown allow for the embedding of raw HTML, and if this HTML is not treated with suspicion, it can be used to inject malicious scripts.

**4.1. Vulnerability Breakdown:**

*   **Direct HTML Embedding:** Markdown, by design, allows for the inclusion of raw HTML tags. This means an attacker can directly insert `<script>` tags or other HTML elements with JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) into a wiki page.
*   **Inadequate Sanitization:** The core of the vulnerability lies in the lack of robust server-side sanitization of user-provided markup before it is rendered. If Gollum directly passes the user's Markdown to the rendering engine without stripping potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes, XSS becomes possible.
*   **Contextual Rendering:**  The browser interprets the rendered HTML within the context of the Gollum application's domain. This means any JavaScript injected through XSS has access to cookies, session storage, and other sensitive information associated with the user's session on the Gollum application.

**4.2. Attack Vectors and Examples (Expanded):**

Beyond the simple `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` example, attackers can employ various techniques:

*   **`<script>` Tag Injection:** The most straightforward method is injecting a `<script>` tag containing malicious JavaScript:
    ```markdown
    <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>
    ```
*   **Event Handler Injection:**  Injecting HTML elements with malicious JavaScript within event handlers:
    ```markdown
    <a href="#" onclick="alert('XSS from link');">Click Me</a>
    <div onmouseover="alert('XSS on hover');">Hover Over Me</div>
    ```
*   **`<iframe>` Injection:** Embedding malicious content from external sources:
    ```markdown
    <iframe src="https://evil.com/steal_cookies.html"></iframe>
    ```
*   **`<svg>` Injection:** Utilizing SVG tags, which can also execute JavaScript:
    ```markdown
    <svg onload="alert('XSS in SVG')"></svg>
    ```
*   **Data URIs:** Embedding JavaScript within data URIs:
    ```markdown
    <a href="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTIGZyb20gRGF0YSBVUkknKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=">Click Me</a>
    ```
*   **Markdown Link Manipulation:** While less direct, attackers might try to manipulate Markdown links to execute JavaScript (though this is often browser-dependent and less reliable with modern browsers):
    ```markdown
    [Link](javascript:alert('XSS via link'))
    ```

**4.3. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

A successful XSS attack via malicious Markdown in Gollum can have severe consequences:

*   **Account Compromise (Session Hijacking):** Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to the Gollum application. This can lead to data breaches, modification of wiki content, and other malicious activities performed under the victim's identity.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Injected scripts can redirect users to phishing sites or websites hosting malware, potentially compromising their devices.
*   **Defacement of Wiki Pages:** Attackers can modify the content and appearance of wiki pages, spreading misinformation or damaging the reputation of the Gollum instance.
*   **Theft of Sensitive Information:**  JavaScript can be used to extract sensitive information displayed on the page or interact with other web services using the user's credentials.
*   **Keylogging and Credential Harvesting:** More sophisticated attacks can involve injecting scripts that log keystrokes or attempt to steal login credentials.
*   **Propagation of Attacks:**  Malicious content can be spread through the wiki, affecting multiple users who view the compromised pages.

**4.4. Gollum-Specific Considerations:**

*   **Multiple Markup Engines:** Gollum supports various markup engines (e.g., Redcarpet for Markdown, RDiscount, etc.). Each engine might have its own nuances in how it handles HTML and potential vulnerabilities. Ensuring consistent and robust sanitization across all supported engines is crucial.
*   **Plugins and Extensions:** If Gollum has plugins or extensions that process user input or modify the rendering process, these could introduce additional XSS vulnerabilities if not properly secured.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:** The impact of an XSS attack can vary depending on the permissions of the compromised user. An attacker compromising an administrator account could have significantly more impact than compromising a regular user.

**4.5. Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies:**

The suggested mitigation strategies are essential for preventing XSS:

*   **Server-Side Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** This is the most critical defense.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Before rendering, all user-provided markup content must be sanitized to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes. Libraries like [OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/) (if using JRuby) or equivalent libraries in Ruby should be employed. A whitelist approach, where only known safe tags and attributes are allowed, is generally more secure than a blacklist approach.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  When rendering content, ensure that output encoding is applied to prevent the browser from interpreting HTML entities as executable code. This typically involves escaping characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strong CSP is a crucial defense-in-depth measure. CSP allows the server to control the resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page. This can significantly reduce the impact of successful XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   **Implementation:** CSP is implemented via HTTP headers. A well-configured CSP should, at a minimum, restrict `script-src` to `'self'` or specific trusted domains and disallow `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.

**4.6. Recommendations and Further Improvements:**

*   **Prioritize Server-Side Sanitization:**  Focus on implementing robust server-side sanitization as the primary defense against XSS. Regularly update sanitization libraries to address newly discovered bypasses.
*   **Context-Aware Encoding:** Ensure that output encoding is applied correctly based on the context where the data is being rendered (e.g., HTML context, JavaScript context, URL context).
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities, to identify and address potential weaknesses.
*   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on common XSS attack vectors and secure coding practices for preventing them.
*   **Consider a Security-Focused Markup Parser:** Explore using markup parsers that have built-in security features or are designed with security in mind.
*   **Input Validation:** While not a direct solution to XSS, input validation can help prevent unexpected or malformed input that might be easier to exploit.
*   **Regularly Update Gollum:** Keep the Gollum installation up-to-date with the latest security patches and releases.
