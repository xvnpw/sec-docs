### 4. Deep Analysis of File Upload Vulnerabilities

#### 4.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Surface

The core of this attack surface lies in the functionality that allows users to upload files to the Gollum wiki. While this feature enhances the wiki's usability by enabling the inclusion of images, documents, and other media, it introduces significant security risks if not implemented with robust security measures.

**Key Components Contributing to the Attack Surface:**

* **Upload Mechanism:** The interface or method through which users submit files to the server. This could be a form element in the web interface, an API endpoint, or another method.
* **File Processing:** The steps Gollum takes to receive, validate, and process the uploaded file. This includes checks on file type, size, and content.
* **Storage Location:** The directory or system where uploaded files are stored on the server. The location and permissions of this storage are critical.
* **File Serving:** The mechanism by which uploaded files are served to users who request them. This often involves the web server directly accessing the storage location.
* **Filename Handling:** How Gollum names and stores the uploaded files. This includes potential sanitization or modification of the original filename.

#### 4.2 Potential Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

Building upon the provided example, here's a more detailed breakdown of potential attack vectors:

* **Malicious Executable Upload:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., PHP, Python, Perl, shell scripts) disguised as a seemingly harmless file (e.g., by using a double extension like `image.jpg.php`).
    * **Exploitation:** If the web server is configured to execute these file types within the storage directory, accessing the uploaded file via a direct URL will execute the malicious code, granting the attacker remote code execution on the server.
    * **Gollum's Role:** Gollum's configuration determines if uploads are allowed and potentially influences where these files are stored. If it stores files within the web server's document root without proper safeguards, it directly contributes to this vulnerability.

* **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker manipulates the filename during upload (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd` or `important_file.txt`) to overwrite or access sensitive files outside the intended upload directory.
    * **Exploitation:** If Gollum doesn't properly sanitize filenames, the web server might store the file in the attacker-specified location, leading to information disclosure or system compromise.
    * **Gollum's Role:** Gollum's filename handling logic is crucial here. Lack of proper sanitization makes the application vulnerable.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via File Upload:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a file (e.g., an HTML file or an SVG image) containing malicious JavaScript code.
    * **Exploitation:** When another user views or interacts with the uploaded file, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
    * **Gollum's Role:** If Gollum serves uploaded files with incorrect `Content-Type` headers or allows direct rendering of user-uploaded HTML, it can facilitate XSS attacks.

* **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a large number of files or excessively large files to consume server resources (disk space, bandwidth, processing power).
    * **Exploitation:** This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing, disrupting the wiki's availability.
    * **Gollum's Role:** Lack of file size limits or rate limiting on uploads can make the application susceptible to DoS attacks.

* **Content Spoofing and Defacement:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads files that replace legitimate content or display misleading information, potentially damaging the wiki's reputation or spreading misinformation.
    * **Exploitation:** If Gollum doesn't have proper access controls or versioning for uploaded files, attackers can easily modify the wiki's appearance.
    * **Gollum's Role:** Gollum's access control mechanisms and file management features play a role in preventing this.

#### 4.3 Gollum-Specific Considerations

* **Configuration Options:**  The extent to which Gollum allows file uploads and the available configuration options for controlling this functionality are critical. Understanding these settings is essential for assessing the attack surface.
* **Storage Mechanism:** How Gollum stores uploaded files (e.g., directly on the filesystem, in a database, or using a cloud storage service) impacts the potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
* **Integration with Web Server:** Gollum's interaction with the underlying web server (e.g., how it handles requests for uploaded files) is a key factor. Misconfigurations in the web server can exacerbate file upload vulnerabilities.
* **Markdown Rendering:** If Gollum allows embedding uploaded files within Markdown content, the rendering process needs to be secure to prevent issues like XSS.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment (Expanded)

The impact of successful exploitation of file upload vulnerabilities can be severe:

* **Server Compromise and Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As highlighted in the example, this is the most critical impact, allowing attackers to gain complete control over the server, install malware, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
* **Unauthorized Access to the File System:** Attackers could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive files and directories on the server.
* **Data Breach:**  Uploaded files might contain sensitive information that could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.
* **Wiki Defacement and Content Manipulation:** Attackers can alter the wiki's content, spread misinformation, or damage its reputation.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:**  Compromising user accounts and potentially leading to further attacks on other systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Rendering the wiki unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Reputational Damage:** Security breaches can severely damage the trust and reputation of the organization hosting the wiki.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the data stored in the wiki, breaches could lead to legal and regulatory penalties.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Categorized)

Based on the identified risks, here are comprehensive mitigation strategies categorized by the responsible parties:

**For Developers:**

* **Strict File Type Validation (Content-Based):**
    * **Implementation:** Validate file types based on their content (magic numbers or file signatures) rather than relying solely on file extensions. Use libraries or functions specifically designed for this purpose.
    * **Rationale:** Prevents attackers from disguising malicious files with innocent-looking extensions.
* **Secure File Storage:**
    * **Implementation:** Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root. Use a separate directory with restricted access permissions.
    * **Rationale:** Prevents direct execution of uploaded scripts by the web server.
* **Serving Files Through a Secure Mechanism:**
    * **Implementation:** Serve uploaded files through a dedicated script or mechanism that enforces access controls and prevents direct execution. Use `Content-Disposition: attachment` header to force downloads instead of rendering in the browser where appropriate.
    * **Rationale:** Adds a layer of indirection and control over file access.
