### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Content via Git

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Malicious Content via Git **(Critical Node)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

As highlighted, this attack vector focuses on directly introducing harmful content into the Git repository that Gollum uses to render its pages. This bypasses typical web input sanitization and validation mechanisms. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

* **Direct Commit with Malicious Content:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker with write access to the Git repository (either legitimate access that has been compromised or unauthorized access gained through other means) directly commits a file containing malicious content.
    * **Malicious Content Examples:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads:**  JavaScript code embedded within Markdown or other supported formats that will execute in a user's browser when the page is rendered by Gollum. This could steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.
        * **Malicious iframes:** Embedding iframes that load content from external, attacker-controlled websites. This could lead to phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, or other malicious activities.
        * **HTML injection:** Injecting arbitrary HTML tags that could alter the page's appearance or behavior in unintended and potentially harmful ways.
        * **Server-Side Includes (SSI) or similar directives (if enabled and vulnerable):**  While less common in modern setups, if Gollum or the underlying web server processes these, attackers could inject commands to be executed on the server.
    * **Impact:** When Gollum renders the page containing this malicious content, the user's browser will execute the injected code, leading to the aforementioned consequences.

* **Compromised Contributor Account:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate contributor's Git account (username and password). This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or malware.
    * **Action:** The attacker uses the compromised account to commit and push malicious content to the repository, effectively disguising the attack as a legitimate contribution.
    * **Impact:** Similar to direct commit, but with the added difficulty of identifying the source of the attack initially.

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Git Workflow or Hosting Platform:**
    * **Scenario:**  While less direct, vulnerabilities in the Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or the Git workflow itself could be exploited to inject malicious content. This is less about directly crafting malicious content and more about manipulating the system to introduce it.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in pull request merging:**  If the merging process doesn't properly sanitize or review changes, a malicious pull request could introduce harmful content.
        * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in Git hooks:**  If custom Git hooks are used and are vulnerable, an attacker might be able to manipulate them to inject content during a commit or push.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability exploited, but could lead to the introduction of malicious content without direct access to a contributor's account.

**Why this is a Critical Node:**

This attack path is considered critical because:

* **Bypasses Traditional Web Security:** It circumvents standard web application security measures like input validation and output encoding that are typically applied to user-generated content submitted through web forms.
* **Direct Impact on Rendered Content:** The malicious content is directly incorporated into the pages served by Gollum, making it immediately effective upon rendering.
* **Difficulty in Detection:**  Identifying malicious content within Git commits can be challenging, especially if the attacker is sophisticated in their obfuscation techniques.
* **Potential for Widespread Impact:**  Once malicious content is in the repository, it will affect all users who view the affected pages.

**Potential Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Account Takeover:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing pages or sites hosting malware.
    * **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the Gollum pages.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Revealing sensitive information through injected HTML or scripts.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Using iframes or other techniques to serve malware to users.
* **Loss of Trust:**  Damaging the reputation of the application and the organization.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Regular Code Reviews of Git Commits:**  Manually reviewing changes for suspicious patterns or potentially harmful code. This can be time-consuming but is crucial for critical projects.
* **Automated Static Analysis of Git Repository:**  Using tools that can scan Git history for potential security vulnerabilities or malicious code patterns.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implementing a strict CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodic assessments of the Gollum application and its underlying infrastructure, including the Git repository.
* **Monitoring Git Activity:**  Tracking commits, pushes, and other Git actions for unusual or suspicious behavior.
* **User Behavior Analytics:**  Identifying unusual patterns in user access and contributions to the Git repository.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Access Control for Git Repository:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Granting only necessary write access to the Git repository.
    * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enforcing 2FA for all contributors to prevent unauthorized access.
    * **Regular Review of Access Permissions:** Periodically reviewing and revoking unnecessary access.
* **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding (Even in Git Context):**
    * **Pre-receive Hooks:** Implementing Git hooks that automatically scan commits for potentially malicious content before they are accepted into the repository. These hooks can perform static analysis or pattern matching.
    * **Post-receive Hooks:**  Similar to pre-receive hooks, but executed after commits are pushed. These can be used for further analysis or triggering alerts.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  As mentioned in detection, a strong CSP is crucial to limit the damage of any successfully injected XSS.
* **Regular Security Training for Contributors:** Educating contributors about the risks of injecting malicious content and best practices for secure coding and Git usage.
* **Code Review Process:** Implementing a mandatory code review process for all changes before they are merged into the main branch. This provides an opportunity to identify and prevent the introduction of malicious content.
* **Dependency Management:** Keeping Gollum and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Consider Signing Commits:** Using GPG or SSH keys to sign commits can help verify the identity of the committer and detect if a commit has been tampered with.
* **"Read-Only" Branches for Production:**  Consider having a production branch that is only updated through carefully reviewed and tested merges, limiting direct write access.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Content via Git" attack path represents a significant security risk for Gollum applications. By directly targeting the content source, attackers can bypass traditional web security measures. Implementing a combination of strict access controls, automated and manual code review processes, input sanitization (even at the Git level), and a strong Content Security Policy is crucial to mitigate this risk effectively. Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are also essential to detect and respond to potential attacks. This deep analysis provides a foundation for the development team to implement robust security measures and protect the application and its users.
