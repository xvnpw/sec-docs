**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Access Sensitive Files Outside the Wiki Directory:**  Successfully reading files that should not be accessible, leading to information disclosure.

    This high-level objective can be achieved through various attack vectors. Here's a deeper dive into potential methods:

    **4.1 Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:**

    * **Description:** Exploiting flaws in how Gollum or the underlying web server handles file paths provided in user requests. Attackers can manipulate these paths (e.g., using `../` sequences) to navigate outside the intended wiki directory and access arbitrary files on the server.
    * **Example Attack:** An attacker might craft a URL like `http://<gollum-server>/<wiki-path>/../../../../etc/passwd` hoping to access the system's password file.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially exposes sensitive system files (passwords, configuration files), application code, database credentials, and other confidential data.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided file paths. Reject requests containing suspicious characters or path traversal sequences.
        * **Canonicalization:** Ensure that file paths are canonicalized (converted to their simplest absolute form) before being used to access files. This prevents bypassing path traversal checks.
        * **Chroot Environment:** If feasible, run the Gollum application within a chroot jail or container to restrict its access to the file system.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running the Gollum process has the minimum necessary permissions to operate.

    **4.2 Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection:**

    * **Description:** If Gollum or the web server allows the inclusion of server-side code within wiki pages, an attacker might inject malicious SSI directives to read arbitrary files.
    * **Example Attack:** An attacker might inject `<!--#include virtual="/etc/passwd" -->` into a wiki page, hoping the server will process it and include the contents of the password file in the rendered output.
    * **Impact:** Similar to path traversal, can lead to the disclosure of sensitive system and application files.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable SSI:** If not required, disable SSI processing on the web server.
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize user input to prevent the injection of SSI directives.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, potentially mitigating the impact of successful SSI injection.

    **4.3 Symbolic Link Exploitation:**

    * **Description:** If the Gollum application or the underlying system mishandles symbolic links, an attacker might create a symbolic link within the wiki directory that points to a sensitive file outside of it. When Gollum attempts to access or serve content related to this link, it could inadvertently expose the target file.
    * **Example Attack:** An attacker with write access to the wiki directory could create a symbolic link named `sensitive_data` pointing to `/etc/shadow`. Accessing `http://<gollum-server>/<wiki-path>/sensitive_data` might then reveal the contents of the shadow file.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to sensitive files, potentially including system credentials.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable Symbolic Link Following:** Configure the web server and Gollum to not follow symbolic links when serving files.
        * **Regularly Audit Wiki Content:** Implement mechanisms to regularly scan the wiki directory for unexpected symbolic links.
        * **Restrict Write Access:** Limit write access to the wiki directory to trusted users or processes.

    **4.4 Configuration Errors and Exposed Backup Files:**

    * **Description:**  Misconfigurations in the web server or Gollum application might inadvertently expose sensitive files. This could include leaving backup files (e.g., `.bak`, `~`) in publicly accessible directories or misconfiguring virtual host settings.
    * **Example Attack:** An attacker might guess or discover the location of a backup file containing database credentials (e.g., `http://<gollum-server>/config/database.yml.bak`).
    * **Impact:** Disclosure of configuration details, credentials, and potentially sensitive application data.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Configuration Practices:** Follow secure configuration guidelines for the web server and Gollum.
        * **Remove Backup Files:** Ensure that backup files are stored outside the web root or are properly secured.
        * **Restrict Directory Listing:** Disable directory listing on the web server to prevent attackers from browsing the file system.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and rectify misconfigurations.

    **4.5 Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries or Frameworks:**

    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Ruby on Rails framework (if used indirectly), the Rack web server interface, or other dependencies used by Gollum could be exploited to gain unauthorized file access.
    * **Example Attack:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of Rack might allow an attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve arbitrary files.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could lead to full system compromise, including access to sensitive files.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Gollum and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses in the application and its dependencies.
        * **Security Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
