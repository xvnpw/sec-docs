### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Commit Malicious Markdown/HTML

**Attack Tree Path:**

**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Commit Malicious Markdown/HTML **(Critical Node)**

            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Commit Malicious Markdown/HTML **(Critical Node)**
**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Commit Malicious Markdown/HTML (Critical Node):** Attackers commit pages containing malicious Markdown or embedded HTML. This is high-risk due to the potential for XSS.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path centers around the ability of users to contribute content to the Gollum wiki through commits. The core vulnerability lies in how Gollum processes and renders user-supplied Markdown and embedded HTML. If Gollum doesn't properly sanitize or escape this content, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Technical Breakdown:**

1. **Attacker Action:** An attacker with commit access (either legitimate or compromised) crafts a wiki page containing malicious code. This code can be embedded within Markdown syntax or directly as HTML.

    * **Malicious Markdown Examples:** While Markdown itself is generally safe, certain extensions or the way Gollum interprets it might be exploitable. For instance, if custom Markdown extensions allow for the inclusion of arbitrary HTML attributes or if there are parsing vulnerabilities.
    * **Malicious HTML Examples:**  Directly embedding `<script>` tags containing JavaScript is the most common and direct way to inject malicious code. Other HTML elements with event handlers (e.g., `<img onerror="maliciousCode()">`) can also be used.

2. **Commit Process:** The attacker commits these changes to the Git repository backing the Gollum wiki.

3. **Gollum Processing:** When a user views the page containing the malicious commit, Gollum fetches the content from the Git repository.

4. **Rendering Vulnerability:**  Gollum's rendering engine processes the Markdown and embedded HTML. If the engine doesn't properly sanitize or escape the malicious code before rendering it in the user's browser, the injected script will be executed.

**Impact Assessment:**

The successful execution of malicious scripts through this attack path can have significant consequences:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary risk. XSS allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the malicious page. This can lead to:
    * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the wiki or other related applications.
    * **Credential Theft:**  Tricking the user into entering their credentials on a fake login form injected by the malicious script.
    * **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session.
    * **Account Takeover:**  Changing the user's password or other account details.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
    * **Defacement:**  Altering the content of the wiki page to display misleading or harmful information.
    * **Propagation of the Attack:**  Using the compromised user's session to inject more malicious content into other wiki pages.

**Underlying Vulnerabilities:**

* **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Gollum may not be adequately sanitizing user-supplied Markdown and HTML before rendering it. This means that potentially harmful characters or code structures are not being removed or escaped.
* **Lack of Output Encoding:** Even if input is sanitized to some extent, Gollum might not be properly encoding the output when rendering the page in the browser. This allows malicious scripts to be interpreted and executed by the browser.
* **Permissive HTML Handling:** Gollum might be too permissive in allowing the inclusion of HTML tags and attributes, including those that can be used for malicious purposes (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers).
* **Vulnerabilities in Markdown Parsers:**  While less common, vulnerabilities in the underlying Markdown parsing library used by Gollum could potentially be exploited to inject malicious code.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack path, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization for all user-supplied content, including Markdown and HTML. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful HTML tags, attributes, and JavaScript code. Libraries like DOMPurify can be used for this purpose.
* **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Ensure that all output rendered in the browser is properly encoded based on the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings). This prevents the browser from interpreting malicious code.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources.
* **Restrict HTML Tags and Attributes:**  Consider limiting the allowed HTML tags and attributes that can be used in wiki pages. This can reduce the attack surface by preventing the use of potentially dangerous elements.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the Gollum application.
* **Keep Gollum and Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Ensure that Gollum and all its dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Educate Users on Security Best Practices:**  If the wiki allows for public contributions, educate users about the risks of including untrusted content and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
* **Consider a Preview Mechanism:** Implement a preview mechanism that renders the content in a sandboxed environment before it is committed. This can help identify potentially malicious code before it goes live.
* **Code Review for Security:** Implement a rigorous code review process that includes a focus on security vulnerabilities, particularly related to input handling and output encoding.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

While prevention is key, implementing detection and monitoring mechanisms can help identify and respond to attacks:

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of user actions, including content commits. Monitor these logs for suspicious patterns or the presence of potentially malicious code.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement systems to detect unusual activity, such as the sudden appearance of `<script>` tags in wiki content.
* **Regular Security Scanning:** Use automated security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Gollum application.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Commit Malicious Markdown/HTML" attack path poses a significant risk to the security of the Gollum wiki due to the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By understanding the technical details of this attack vector, its potential impact, and the underlying vulnerabilities, the development team can implement effective mitigation strategies. Prioritizing robust input sanitization, context-aware output encoding, and a strong Content Security Policy are crucial steps in securing the Gollum application against this type of attack. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
