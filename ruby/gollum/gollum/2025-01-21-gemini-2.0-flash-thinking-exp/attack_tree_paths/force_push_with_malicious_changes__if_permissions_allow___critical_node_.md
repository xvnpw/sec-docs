### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Force Push with Malicious Changes (If Permissions Allow)

**Attack Tree Path:** Force Push with Malicious Changes (If Permissions Allow) **(Critical Node)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Manipulate Git History/Branches:**
    *   **Force Push with Malicious Changes (If Permissions Allow) (Critical Node):** If the attacker has sufficient Git permissions, they can overwrite history with malicious content. This is critical due to its potential for widespread and difficult-to-revert damage.

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack

This attack leverages the `git push --force` command (or similar force-pushing mechanisms) to overwrite the remote repository's history. For this to be successful, the attacker must possess the necessary write permissions to the remote Git repository used by Gollum.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Compromised Credentials or Elevated Permissions:** The attacker must have valid Git credentials with the ability to force push to the relevant branch(es) of the Gollum repository. This could be due to:
    * **Stolen credentials:**  Phishing, malware, or other credential theft methods.
    * **Insider threat:** A malicious actor with legitimate access.
    * **Misconfigured permissions:**  Accidental or intentional granting of excessive permissions.
    * **Exploitation of a vulnerability in the Git hosting platform:**  Although less likely, vulnerabilities in the platform hosting the Git repository could be exploited.
* **Knowledge of the Repository Structure:** The attacker needs to understand the repository structure to effectively inject malicious content or remove legitimate content.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Gain Access:** The attacker obtains the necessary Git credentials or exploits a vulnerability to gain write access with force-push capabilities.
2. **Clone the Repository:** The attacker clones the Gollum repository to their local machine.
3. **Make Malicious Changes:** The attacker modifies the wiki content locally. This could involve:
    * **Injecting malicious scripts:** Adding JavaScript or other code that could be executed in users' browsers.
    * **Defacing content:**  Altering or deleting important information.
    * **Inserting misinformation:**  Spreading false or misleading content.
    * **Adding backdoors:**  Introducing code that allows for future unauthorized access.
4. **Force Push Changes:** The attacker uses the `git push --force` command to overwrite the remote repository's history with their malicious changes. This effectively rewrites the shared history, making it difficult to revert without specific Git knowledge and potentially losing legitimate contributions.

#### 4.2. Potential Impact

The impact of a successful force push with malicious changes can be severe:

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** The wiki content is altered, potentially introducing inaccuracies, misinformation, or malicious code. This erodes trust in the information presented.
* **Availability Disruption:**  If critical pages are deleted or corrupted, the wiki's availability can be significantly impacted.
* **Security Risks:**  Injection of malicious scripts can lead to:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:**  Attacking users who browse the compromised wiki.
    * **Credential theft:**  Stealing user credentials through malicious scripts.
    * **Malware distribution:**  Using the wiki as a platform to distribute malware.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the reputation of the organization or project using the Gollum wiki.
* **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the platform if they perceive it as insecure or unreliable.
* **Difficulty in Recovery:** Reverting a force push can be complex and may lead to the loss of legitimate contributions if not handled carefully.

#### 4.3. Vulnerabilities Enabling the Attack

The primary vulnerability enabling this attack is **insufficient access control and lack of protection against force pushes**. Specifically:

* **Overly Permissive Git Permissions:**  Granting force-push permissions to a large number of users increases the attack surface.
* **Lack of Branch Protection:**  Not enabling branch protection rules on critical branches (e.g., `main`, `master`) allows users with write access to force push.
* **Weak Authentication and Authorization:**  Compromised credentials due to weak passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), or insecure storage of credentials.
* **Insufficient Monitoring and Auditing:**  Lack of monitoring for force push events and changes to Git history makes it difficult to detect and respond to attacks quickly.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of a force push with malicious changes, the following strategies should be implemented:

**Preventative Controls:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant Git write and force-push permissions only to users who absolutely require them. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions.
* **Implement Branch Protection Rules:**  Utilize the branch protection features of the Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to:
    * **Disable force pushing on protected branches:** This is the most effective way to prevent this attack.
    * **Require pull requests and code reviews:**  Mandate that changes are reviewed and approved before being merged into protected branches.
    * **Restrict who can merge pull requests:**  Limit merge permissions to trusted individuals or teams.
* **Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Mandate strong passwords:** Implement password complexity requirements and encourage the use of password managers.
    * **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require users to provide an additional verification factor beyond their password.
    * **Regularly rotate credentials:**  Implement a policy for periodic password changes.
* **Secure Credential Management:**  Avoid storing Git credentials in plain text. Utilize secure credential storage mechanisms.
* **Educate Users:**  Train users on Git security best practices, including the risks of force pushing and how to identify phishing attempts.

**Detective Controls:**

* **Monitor Git Logs and Events:**  Implement monitoring to detect force push events and changes to Git history. Alert administrators to suspicious activity.
* **Implement Content Integrity Checks:**  Regularly compare the current wiki content with a known good state to detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Audit Git Access and Permissions:**  Periodically review Git access logs and permissions to identify any anomalies or misconfigurations.
* **Version Control and Backup Strategy:**  Maintain regular backups of the Git repository to facilitate recovery in case of a successful attack.

**Response and Recovery:**

* **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop a clear incident response plan for handling security breaches, including steps for investigating, containing, and recovering from a force push attack.
* **Git History Rewriting (with Caution):**  In the event of a successful attack, carefully consider the implications of rewriting Git history to remove malicious changes. This should be done with caution as it can have unintended consequences for other collaborators.
* **Communication Plan:**  Have a plan for communicating with users and stakeholders in case of a security incident.

#### 4.5. Conclusion

The "Force Push with Malicious Changes (If Permissions Allow)" attack path represents a significant threat to the integrity and security of a Gollum wiki. Its potential for widespread and difficult-to-revert damage necessitates a strong focus on preventative measures, particularly around access control and branch protection. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this critical attack. Continuous monitoring and a robust incident response plan are also crucial for detecting and responding effectively to any security breaches.
