### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify Page Content to Deface or Misinform

**HIGH-RISK PATH: Modify Page Content to Deface or Misinform**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Modify Page Content to Deface or Misinform:** XSS alters the content of the wiki for malicious purposes.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This high-risk path centers around an attacker's ability to inject malicious scripts into wiki pages, which are then executed by other users viewing those pages. This is the core definition of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

XSS vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows untrusted data, provided by a user, to be included in a web page without proper validation or escaping. When another user views the page, the malicious script is executed by their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:

* **Modify Page Content:**  Inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to change the visual appearance and content of the page. This can range from simple defacement (e.g., replacing text or images) to more sophisticated misinformation campaigns (e.g., altering factual information, adding misleading links).
* **Steal Sensitive Information:** Access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data stored in the user's browser.
* **Redirect Users:** Redirect users to malicious websites.
* **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:**  If the user is authenticated, the attacker can perform actions as that user, such as editing other pages or changing settings.

**Potential Vulnerability Areas in Gollum:**

Given Gollum's functionality as a wiki, several areas could be susceptible to XSS if not properly secured:

* **Page Editing:**  The primary area of concern is the page editing functionality. If Gollum doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided Markdown or HTML input, attackers can inject malicious scripts.
    * **Markdown Rendering:** Gollum uses a Markdown parser to convert user input into HTML. Vulnerabilities could exist in the parser itself or in how Gollum handles specific Markdown elements that allow embedding HTML or JavaScript.
    * **HTML Input:** If Gollum allows users to directly input HTML (even if restricted), improper sanitization can lead to XSS.
* **Comments/Discussions:** If Gollum has a commenting or discussion feature, these areas can also be targets for XSS injection if user input is not properly handled.
* **File Uploads (Indirect):** While not directly modifying page content, if Gollum allows file uploads and those files are served without proper `Content-Type` headers or are rendered in the browser (e.g., SVG files), they could be used to deliver XSS payloads.
* **Wiki Configuration/Settings:** If administrative users can modify settings that are then rendered on the front-end without proper escaping, this could be an avenue for persistent XSS.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Attacker Identifies Vulnerable Input:** The attacker discovers a page editing field or comment section where they can inject malicious JavaScript.
2. **Malicious Payload Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious script, for example:
   ```html
   <script>
       // Example: Redirect to a malicious site
       window.location.href = "https://attacker.example.com/malicious_page";
   </script>
   ```
   Or, for defacement:
   ```html
   <script>
       document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>This wiki has been defaced!</h1>";
   </script>
   ```
3. **Saving the Malicious Content:** The attacker saves the page or submits the comment containing the malicious script.
4. **Victim Views the Page:** When another user views the compromised page, their browser executes the injected script.
5. **Malicious Action:** The script redirects the user, defaces the page, or performs other malicious actions as defined in the payload.

**Impact Assessment:**

A successful "Modify Page Content to Deface or Misinform" attack via XSS can have significant consequences:

* **Reputation Damage:** Defacement can severely damage the reputation and trustworthiness of the wiki and the organization hosting it.
* **Misinformation Spread:**  Altering factual information can lead to the spread of false or misleading content, potentially causing harm or confusion.
* **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the platform if they encounter defaced or manipulated content.
* **Further Attacks:**  Successful XSS can be a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks, such as session hijacking or credential theft.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack path, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all user input on the server-side to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths. Reject any input that doesn't meet the criteria.
    * **Contextual Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape user-provided data before rendering it in HTML. The encoding method should be appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for displaying text, JavaScript escaping for embedding in JavaScript). Gollum likely uses a templating engine; ensure proper escaping is used within the templates.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load for a given page. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws.
* **Keep Gollum and Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Ensure that Gollum and its underlying dependencies (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Markdown parsers) are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Educate Users:**  While not a direct technical mitigation, educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or running untrusted scripts can help reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.
* **Consider using a robust Markdown parser with built-in XSS protection:** Explore options for Markdown parsers that have strong security features and are actively maintained.
* **Implement a "Preview" feature for edits:** Allow users to preview their changes before saving them. This can help detect potentially malicious scripts before they are permanently added to the page.

**Conclusion:**

The "Modify Page Content to Deface or Misinform" attack path, primarily through XSS, poses a significant risk to the Gollum wiki application. By understanding the mechanics of XSS and implementing robust security measures, the development team can effectively mitigate this threat and ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the wiki content. Prioritizing input validation, output encoding, and the implementation of a strong CSP are crucial steps in securing the application against this type of attack.
