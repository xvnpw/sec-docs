### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Upload Web Shells

**HIGH-RISK PATH: Upload Web Shells**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Upload Vulnerability:**
    *   **Description:** If Gollum allows users to upload files (e.g., as attachments or media), and there are insufficient security checks on the uploaded file's content or type, an attacker could upload a malicious script disguised as a legitimate file.
    *   **Potential Weaknesses:**
        *   Lack of input validation on file extensions.
        *   Insufficient checks for executable code within uploaded files.
        *   Storing uploaded files in a publicly accessible directory without proper access controls.
        *   Using insecure file naming conventions that could allow overwriting existing files.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Attacker gains access to a user account with upload privileges (if required).
        2. Attacker crafts a web shell script (e.g., in PHP, Python, or other server-side languages).
        3. Attacker attempts to upload the web shell through the Gollum interface, potentially disguised with a seemingly innocuous file extension (e.g., `.jpg.php`, `.txt`).
        4. If the application doesn't properly validate the file, the web shell is stored on the server.
        5. Attacker accesses the uploaded web shell through a direct URL, triggering its execution on the server.

*   **Exploiting Content Editing Features:**
    *   **Description:** If Gollum allows users to embed or include external content (e.g., through iframes, script tags, or specific markup languages), an attacker might be able to inject malicious code that, when rendered by the server, executes a web shell.
    *   **Potential Weaknesses:**
        *   Insufficient sanitization of user-provided content.
        *   Lack of proper output encoding to prevent script execution.
        *   Vulnerabilities in the Markdown or other rendering engines used by Gollum.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Attacker gains access to a user account with content editing privileges.
        2. Attacker attempts to embed malicious code within a Gollum page. This could involve:
            *   Injecting a `<script>` tag pointing to an external web shell.
            *   Using a vulnerable Markdown feature to execute code.
            *   Embedding an iframe hosting a malicious page that exploits browser vulnerabilities to execute code on the server (less direct but possible).
        3. When another user (or the attacker) views the page, the malicious code is executed by the server or the user's browser, potentially leading to the download or execution of a web shell.

*   **Git Repository Manipulation (Less Direct but Possible):**
    *   **Description:** Since Gollum stores its content in a Git repository, an attacker with write access to the repository could potentially introduce a web shell directly into the file system.
    *   **Potential Weaknesses:**
        *   Compromised Git credentials.
        *   Lack of proper access controls on the Git repository.
        *   Vulnerabilities in the Git server itself.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Attacker gains write access to the underlying Git repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerable Git server).
        2. Attacker commits a new file containing the web shell or modifies an existing file to include malicious code.
        3. When Gollum updates its content from the repository, the web shell is deployed to the server's file system.
        4. Attacker accesses the uploaded web shell through a direct URL, triggering its execution.

**Preconditions for Successful Attack:**

*   **Vulnerable Gollum Instance:** The Gollum application must have vulnerabilities related to file handling, content sanitization, or access controls.
*   **Attacker Access:** The attacker needs some level of access to the Gollum application, either through a legitimate user account or by exploiting an authentication bypass vulnerability.
*   **Server-Side Execution Capability:** The server hosting Gollum must be configured to execute the type of script uploaded as the web shell (e.g., PHP interpreter for a PHP web shell).
*   **Writable File System:** The Gollum application needs write permissions to the directory where uploaded files are stored (for direct upload attacks).

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Gollum application.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored within the Gollum wiki or on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, leading to further attacks on other systems.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can disrupt the availability of the Gollum application by modifying or deleting critical files.
*   **Malware Deployment:** The attacker can use the web shell to upload and execute other malicious software on the server.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised server can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

**Detection Strategies:**

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF with rules to detect and block attempts to upload files with suspicious extensions or content.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity, such as attempts to access known web shell paths.
*   **Log Monitoring and Analysis:** Implement robust logging for web server access, application activity, and file system changes. Analyze these logs for suspicious patterns, such as access to unusual file paths or execution of unexpected scripts.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to monitor critical directories for unauthorized file modifications or additions.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**Mitigation and Prevention Strategies:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data, including file uploads and content entered into the wiki. Sanitize user-generated content to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
*   **File Type Restrictions and Validation:** Enforce strict file type restrictions for uploads. Validate the content of uploaded files to ensure they match the declared type and do not contain executable code.
*   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a directory with restricted execution permissions. Use unique and unpredictable file names to prevent direct access.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the risk of injected scripts.
*   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the Gollum application and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid granting unnecessary file upload or content editing privileges.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure the web server and underlying operating system are securely configured, following security best practices.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Gollum application's code.
*   **Git Repository Security:** Implement strong access controls and authentication for the Git repository. Regularly audit repository access logs. Consider using Git hooks to prevent the introduction of malicious content.

**Specific Considerations for Gollum:**

*   **Review Gollum's Attachment Handling:** Carefully examine how Gollum handles file attachments and ensure proper validation and security measures are in place.
*   **Sanitize Markdown/Markup:** If Gollum uses Markdown or another markup language, ensure that it is properly sanitized to prevent the execution of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
*   **Access Control for Editing:** Implement granular access controls for editing pages and uploading content.

**Conclusion:**

The "Upload Web Shells" attack path poses a significant risk to the security of a Gollum wiki application. By understanding the potential attack vectors, implementing robust security controls, and following security best practices, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful attack and protect their systems and data. This deep analysis provides a foundation for implementing targeted mitigation strategies and enhancing the overall security posture of the Gollum application.
