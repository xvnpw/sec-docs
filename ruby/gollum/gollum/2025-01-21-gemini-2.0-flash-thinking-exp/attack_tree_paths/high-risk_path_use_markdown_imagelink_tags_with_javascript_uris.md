### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Use Markdown Image/Link Tags with JavaScript URIs

**Attack Description:**

This attack leverages the functionality of Markdown to embed images and links. Markdown allows users to define images and links using specific syntax. The vulnerability arises when the application (Gollum in this case) renders this Markdown into HTML without properly sanitizing or escaping the URI provided within the image or link tag.

Specifically, an attacker can craft Markdown content like this:

*   **Image Tag:** `![Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS'))`
*   **Link Tag:** `[Click Here](javascript:alert('XSS'))`

When Gollum renders this Markdown, the Markdown parser will translate these lines into the following HTML:

*   **Image Tag:** `<img src="javascript:alert('XSS')" alt="Click Me">`
*   **Link Tag:** `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Here</a>`

Modern web browsers, upon encountering the `javascript:` URI in the `src` or `href` attribute, will execute the JavaScript code embedded within it.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Markdown Parsing:** Gollum uses a Markdown parsing library to convert user-provided Markdown syntax into HTML. The vulnerability lies in how this library or the subsequent rendering process handles URIs. If the library doesn't explicitly block or escape `javascript:` URIs, they will be passed through to the generated HTML.
*   **Browser Behavior:** Web browsers are designed to execute JavaScript found in `javascript:` URIs within `src` and `href` attributes. This is a standard browser feature, but it becomes a security risk when user-controlled input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The core issue is the absence of robust input sanitization or output escaping mechanisms within Gollum's Markdown rendering pipeline. Sanitization would involve removing or modifying potentially harmful content (like `javascript:` URIs). Escaping would involve converting special characters (like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`) into their HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting the URI as executable JavaScript.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to various security risks, primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject JavaScript to steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate logged-in users and gain unauthorized access to the Gollum wiki.
*   **Credential Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to create fake login forms or redirect users to phishing sites to steal their credentials.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of wiki pages, injecting malicious content or altering existing information.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  JavaScript can be used to redirect users to external websites hosting malware or phishing scams.
*   **Keylogging:**  Injected scripts can capture user keystrokes within the context of the Gollum application.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers might be able to access sensitive information displayed on the page or interact with other parts of the application on behalf of the victim.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack being successful is relatively **high** if the vulnerability exists:

*   **Ease of Exploitation:** Crafting the malicious Markdown is straightforward and requires minimal technical expertise.
*   **Common Vulnerability:**  XSS vulnerabilities are common in web applications that handle user-generated content.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user viewing the page containing the malicious Markdown. This is a common occurrence in a wiki environment.
*   **Potential for Automation:**  Attackers could potentially automate the process of injecting malicious Markdown across multiple pages.

**Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary vulnerability being exploited. Specifically, this is a form of **stored XSS** because the malicious payload is stored within the wiki content and executed when other users view the page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Output Escaping:** The root cause of the XSS vulnerability is the lack of proper handling of user-provided input during the Markdown rendering process.

**Affected Components:**

*   **Markdown Rendering Engine:** The component responsible for parsing and converting Markdown to HTML.
*   **User Interface (Browser):** The user's web browser that executes the malicious JavaScript.
*   **Gollum Application:** The overall application is vulnerable as it allows the injection and execution of malicious scripts.
*   **Users of the Gollum Application:** Users who view pages containing the malicious Markdown are at risk.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Input Sanitization/Output Escaping:**
    *   **Strict URI Filtering:** Implement a whitelist of allowed URI schemes (e.g., `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) and reject any URIs that do not match the whitelist. Specifically, block `javascript:` URIs.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Escaping:**  Ensure that all user-provided content, especially within Markdown tags, is properly escaped before being rendered as HTML. Use a robust escaping library that is aware of the HTML context.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a strong CSP header that restricts the sources from which scripts can be executed. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if a vulnerability exists. For example, `script-src 'self'` would only allow scripts from the same origin.
*   **Secure Markdown Rendering Libraries:**
    *   Ensure that the Markdown rendering library used by Gollum is up-to-date and has known vulnerabilities addressed. Consider using a library that provides built-in options for sanitizing or escaping potentially dangerous content.
    *   Configure the Markdown rendering library to disable or escape potentially dangerous features by default.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws.
*   **User Education:**
    *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or viewing content from untrusted sources. While this is a stored XSS issue, awareness can help prevent social engineering attacks that might leverage this vulnerability.
*   **Consider a "Safe Mode" or Preview Feature:**
    *   Implement a feature that allows users to preview rendered Markdown content before it is permanently saved. This can help identify potentially malicious code before it affects other users.

### 6. Conclusion

The ability to execute JavaScript through Markdown image and link tags poses a significant security risk to the Gollum application. This vulnerability, stemming from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, can lead to various forms of XSS attacks with potentially severe consequences, including session hijacking, credential theft, and data manipulation.

Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly strict URI filtering and context-aware output escaping, is crucial to protect the application and its users. Regular security assessments and staying updated with the latest security best practices are essential for maintaining a secure Gollum environment. Addressing this high-risk path should be a priority for the development team.
