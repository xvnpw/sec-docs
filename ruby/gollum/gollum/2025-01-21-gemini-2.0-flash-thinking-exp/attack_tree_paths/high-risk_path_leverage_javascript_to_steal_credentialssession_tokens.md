## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens" within the context of a Gollum wiki application (https://github.com/gollum/gollum).

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack path "Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens," specifically focusing on how an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the Gollum application to execute malicious JavaScript and compromise user credentials or session tokens. This includes identifying potential attack vectors, prerequisites for successful exploitation, the impact of such an attack, and relevant mitigation strategies.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the specific attack path: **Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens**, with the underlying mechanism being **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. We will focus on the technical aspects of the attack, potential entry points within the Gollum application, and the immediate consequences of successful exploitation. The analysis will consider both stored and reflected XSS scenarios. We will not delve into social engineering aspects or attacks targeting the underlying infrastructure beyond the Gollum application itself.

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodology:

* **Attack Vector Identification:**  We will identify the potential entry points within the Gollum application where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript. This includes examining user input fields, markdown rendering processes, and any other areas where user-controlled content is processed and displayed.
* **Prerequisite Analysis:** We will determine the conditions necessary for the attack to succeed. This includes identifying vulnerable code sections, lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, and the attacker's ability to inject and execute JavaScript.
* **Step-by-Step Attack Simulation (Conceptual):** We will outline the typical steps an attacker would take to exploit the identified vulnerabilities and achieve the objective of stealing credentials or session tokens.
* **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, focusing on the impact on individual users and the overall security of the Gollum application.
* **Mitigation Strategy Formulation:** Based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors, we will propose specific mitigation strategies that the development team can implement to prevent this type of attack.
* **Reference to Gollum Architecture:** We will consider the architecture of Gollum, particularly its reliance on Ruby and potentially its use of JavaScript libraries, to understand the context of potential vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens

**HIGH-RISK PATH: Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens:**  XSS is used to steal sensitive information, leading to account takeover.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This high-risk path centers around exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Gollum application. The core idea is that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed by other users' browsers. This malicious script can then be used to steal sensitive information, primarily user credentials or session tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored (Persistent) XSS:**
    *   **Vulnerable Markdown Rendering:** Gollum uses a markdown parser to render wiki content. If the parser doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided markdown, an attacker could embed malicious JavaScript within a wiki page. This script would then be executed every time another user views that page.
    *   **Vulnerable Comments/Discussions:** If Gollum has a commenting or discussion feature, and user input is not properly sanitized, attackers could inject malicious scripts within comments.
    *   **Vulnerable Page Titles/Metadata:**  Less likely but possible, if page titles or other metadata are rendered without proper escaping, they could be potential injection points.

*   **Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS:**
    *   **Vulnerable Search Functionality:** If the search functionality doesn't properly handle user input, an attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code. When a user clicks on this link, the script is reflected back by the server and executed in their browser.
    *   **Vulnerable Error Messages/Parameters:**  If error messages or URL parameters are displayed without proper encoding, they could be exploited for reflected XSS.

**Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**

*   **Presence of XSS Vulnerabilities:** The Gollum application must have exploitable XSS vulnerabilities in its code. This typically arises from a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Attacker's Ability to Inject Malicious Code:** The attacker needs a way to inject the malicious JavaScript. For stored XSS, this involves contributing to the wiki content. For reflected XSS, this involves crafting malicious URLs.
*   **Victim Interaction:** For reflected XSS, the victim needs to click on the malicious link. For stored XSS, the victim simply needs to view the compromised page.

**Step-by-Step Attack Simulation:**

1. **Injection:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** The attacker edits a wiki page and includes malicious JavaScript within the markdown content (e.g., using `<script>` tags or event handlers like `<img src="x" onerror="maliciousCode()">`).
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript in a parameter (e.g., `https://gollum.example.com/search?query=<script>maliciousCode()</script>`).

2. **Execution:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** When another user views the compromised wiki page, their browser parses the HTML and executes the embedded malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** When a user clicks the malicious link, the server reflects the injected script back in the response, and the browser executes it.

3. **Credential/Session Token Stealing:** The malicious JavaScript can perform the following actions:
    *   **Access `document.cookie`:** This allows the script to read session cookies, which are often used for authentication.
    *   **Access Local Storage/Session Storage:** If the application stores authentication tokens in local or session storage, the script can access this data.
    *   **Send Data to Attacker's Server:** The script can use `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` to send the stolen credentials or session tokens to a server controlled by the attacker. This can be done via a simple GET request with the stolen data in the URL or a POST request.

4. **Account Takeover:** Once the attacker has the user's session token or credentials, they can impersonate the user and gain access to their account. This allows them to:
    *   View and modify wiki content.
    *   Potentially access other resources or functionalities within the application.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges if the compromised user has administrative rights.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

*   **Account Takeover:** The most direct impact is the attacker gaining control of user accounts.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access and potentially modify sensitive information stored within the wiki.
*   **Reputation Damage:** If the application is publicly accessible, such attacks can severely damage the reputation of the organization hosting the wiki.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  Compromised accounts could be used to inject further malicious content or links, potentially spreading malware to other users.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In a more complex scenario, if the compromised user has access to other systems, the attacker could potentially use this as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Robust Input Sanitization:**  All user-provided input, especially in markdown content, comments, and search queries, must be thoroughly sanitized to remove or neutralize potentially malicious JavaScript code. Libraries specifically designed for markdown sanitization should be used.
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Data being displayed to the user should be encoded based on the context in which it is being displayed. For HTML output, HTML entities should be encoded. For JavaScript contexts, JavaScript encoding should be used.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can significantly limit the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts or scripts from untrusted domains.
*   **HTTPOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:** Set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing them. Set the `Secure` flag to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If using external JavaScript libraries, implement SRI to ensure that the browser only executes the expected code and not a compromised version.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links and the importance of reporting any unusual behavior.
*   **Consider using a secure markdown rendering library:** Explore and utilize markdown rendering libraries that are known for their security and actively maintained against XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Framework-Level Security Features:** Leverage any built-in security features provided by the underlying framework (e.g., Ruby on Rails) to prevent XSS.

**Conclusion:**

The "Leverage JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens" attack path, relying on XSS vulnerabilities, poses a significant risk to the Gollum application and its users. Successful exploitation can lead to account takeover, data breaches, and reputational damage. Implementing robust input sanitization, context-aware output encoding, and a strong Content Security Policy are crucial steps in mitigating this risk. Continuous security vigilance, including regular audits and penetration testing, is essential to ensure the ongoing security of the application. The development team should prioritize addressing potential XSS vulnerabilities to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the Gollum wiki.
