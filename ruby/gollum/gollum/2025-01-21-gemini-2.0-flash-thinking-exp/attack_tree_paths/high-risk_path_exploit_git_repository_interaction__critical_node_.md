### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Git Repository Interaction

**HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Git Repository Interaction (Critical Node)**

This critical node highlights the inherent risk associated with the tight coupling between the Gollum wiki and its underlying Git repository. Gaining unauthorized access or control over the Git repository can have severe consequences for the integrity and availability of the wiki.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

As stated in the provided information, this path focuses on leveraging the underlying Git repository to inject malicious content or manipulate the wiki's state. Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential attack vectors:

* **Direct Git Repository Manipulation (Requires Access):**

    * **Unauthorized Push Access:** If an attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Git repository (e.g., compromised credentials, misconfigured permissions), they can directly push malicious commits.
        * **Impact:**  This allows for the injection of arbitrary content, including malicious scripts (JavaScript, HTML), defacement of pages, or even complete replacement of the wiki content. Malicious code could be executed in users' browsers when they view the compromised pages.
        * **Example:** An attacker could push a commit that modifies a page to include a `<script>` tag that steals user cookies or redirects them to a phishing site.
    * **Branch Manipulation:** An attacker with write access could manipulate branches, potentially overwriting legitimate content with malicious versions or creating rogue branches with misleading information.
        * **Impact:**  Leads to data loss, content corruption, and confusion for users. Malicious branches could be presented as legitimate, leading users to access compromised content.
        * **Example:** An attacker could force-push to the `main` branch, overwriting the current content with a compromised version.
    * **Tag Manipulation:**  Attackers could create or modify Git tags to point to malicious commits, potentially tricking users or automated systems that rely on tags for versioning or deployment.
        * **Impact:**  Can lead to the deployment of compromised versions of the wiki or confusion about the current state of the content.
        * **Example:** An attacker could create a tag named `v1.0.1` pointing to a commit containing malicious content, while the legitimate `v1.0.1` points to a clean version.

* **Exploiting Git Hooks:**

    * **Malicious Pre-receive/Post-receive Hooks:** If the Git repository has server-side hooks configured, an attacker with write access could modify these hooks to execute arbitrary code on the server when commits are pushed.
        * **Impact:**  This allows for server-side compromise, potentially leading to data exfiltration, further system exploitation, or denial of service.
        * **Example:** An attacker could modify a `post-receive` hook to execute a script that installs a backdoor on the server.

* **Manipulation via Gollum's Git Interaction:**

    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Gollum's Git Operations:**  While not directly manipulating the Git repository, vulnerabilities in how Gollum interacts with Git could be exploited. For example, if Gollum doesn't properly sanitize commit messages or file names retrieved from Git, this could lead to injection vulnerabilities when rendering the wiki.
        * **Impact:**  Can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if unsanitized content from Git is displayed in the browser.
        * **Example:** A malicious user could create a page with a title containing a `<script>` tag, and if Gollum doesn't sanitize this title when displaying it, the script will execute in other users' browsers.
    * **Abuse of Collaboration Features:** If Gollum allows for collaborative editing through Git (e.g., pull requests), an attacker could introduce malicious content through a seemingly legitimate contribution.
        * **Impact:**  Injects malicious content into the wiki, potentially affecting other users.
        * **Example:** An attacker could submit a pull request that includes a seemingly innocuous change but also contains hidden malicious JavaScript.

* **Compromising the `.git` Directory (If Accessible):**

    * **Direct Modification of `.git` Contents:** If the `.git` directory is accessible through the web server (due to misconfiguration), an attacker could directly modify its contents to manipulate the repository's state.
        * **Impact:**  Can lead to severe repository corruption, data loss, and the ability to inject malicious content.
        * **Example:** An attacker could modify the `HEAD` file to point to a malicious commit or alter object files directly.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risks associated with exploiting Git repository interaction, the following strategies should be considered:

* **Strict Access Control for the Git Repository:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Git repository. Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and principle of least privilege.
* **Regular Security Audits of Git Repository Permissions:** Periodically review and verify the access permissions for the Git repository to ensure no unauthorized access exists.
* **Secure Server Configuration:** Ensure the web server hosting the Gollum wiki is configured to prevent direct access to the `.git` directory.
* **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**  Implement rigorous input sanitization for any data retrieved from the Git repository (commit messages, file names, content) before displaying it in the wiki. Use appropriate output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews for Gollum's Git Interaction:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of the Gollum application, focusing on the code that interacts with the Git repository, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Monitoring and Logging of Git Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging of Git repository activity to detect suspicious or unauthorized actions.
* **Consider Using Signed Commits:**  Implement signed commits to ensure the integrity and authenticity of commits.
* **Regular Backups of the Git Repository:**  Maintain regular backups of the Git repository to facilitate recovery in case of a successful attack.
* **Educate Users on Secure Collaboration Practices:** If collaborative editing is enabled, educate users on how to identify and avoid introducing malicious content.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected malicious scripts.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Git Repository Interaction" path represents a significant security risk for Gollum wikis. The potential impact of a successful attack through this path is high, ranging from content defacement to complete compromise of the wiki and potentially the underlying server. By implementing robust security measures focused on access control, input validation, secure server configuration, and regular monitoring, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of attacks targeting the Git repository interaction. Prioritizing the security of the underlying Git repository is crucial for maintaining the integrity, availability, and trustworthiness of the Gollum wiki.
