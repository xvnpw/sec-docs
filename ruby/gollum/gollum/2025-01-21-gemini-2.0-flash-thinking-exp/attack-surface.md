# Attack Surface Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown/Markup](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdownmarkup.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown/Markup
    *   **How Gollum Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gollum's core functionality involves rendering user-provided content in various markup formats (Markdown, Textile, etc.). This direct rendering of potentially untrusted input without proper sanitization creates the opportunity for attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a wiki page with Markdown containing `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When another user views this page, the JavaScript within the `onerror` attribute executes in their browser due to Gollum rendering the unsanitized HTML.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), redirection to malicious sites, defacement of wiki pages, theft of sensitive information by executing arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided markup content *before* rendering it. Utilize established libraries specifically designed for XSS prevention in the chosen rendering engine. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Git Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/git_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Git Command Injection
    *   **How Gollum Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gollum relies on interacting with the underlying Git repository to manage wiki pages (e.g., creating, editing, deleting). If user input (such as page names or commit messages) is incorporated into Git commands without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject arbitrary Git commands.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in how Gollum handles page renaming could allow an attacker to provide a malicious page name like `; rm -rf / #` which, if directly used in a `git mv` command, could lead to the deletion of files on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Git repository, leading to data loss, corruption of the wiki's history, and potentially server compromise if injected Git commands allow for arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid constructing Git commands by directly concatenating user input. Utilize Git libraries or APIs that provide safe abstractions and parameterization mechanisms to prevent command injection. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in Git operations. Run the Gollum process with the least privileges necessary to interact with the Git repository.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** File Upload Vulnerabilities (if enabled)
    *   **How Gollum Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Gollum's configuration allows users to upload files (e.g., for embedding images or attachments), this functionality introduces risks if not handled securely. Gollum's role is in providing the mechanism for these uploads and potentially how these files are stored and served.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image. If Gollum stores this file within the web server's document root and the server is configured to execute PHP files, the attacker could access this script via a web request and execute arbitrary code on the server. Another example is exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities by manipulating the filename during upload (e.g., naming a file `../../evil.php`) to overwrite sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, unauthorized access to the file system, defacement of the wiki.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers), not just the file extension. Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism that prevents direct execution. Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Implement file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a dedicated storage service with robust security features.
