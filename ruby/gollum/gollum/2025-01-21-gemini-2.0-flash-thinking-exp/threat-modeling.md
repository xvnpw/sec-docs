# Threat Model Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown content that, when rendered by Gollum, injects client-side scripts into the user's browser. This is due to vulnerabilities within Gollum's Markdown parsing or sanitization logic. The attacker might insert `<script>` tags or use other HTML features to execute JavaScript.

**Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's session, potentially stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the wiki page.

**Affected Component:** Gollum's Markdown rendering engine (likely a specific library or module responsible for converting Markdown to HTML).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Gollum and its dependencies (especially the Markdown parsing library) up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within Gollum when rendering Markdown content to HTML.
*   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Attachments or Includes (if enabled)](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_attachments_or_includes__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If Gollum allows file attachments or includes and doesn't properly sanitize file paths, an attacker could potentially access or include files outside of the intended directory structure. This is a vulnerability within Gollum's file handling logic, allowing manipulation of file paths with ".." sequences.

**Impact:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive files on the server's file system or include malicious code from unexpected locations, leading to potential remote code execution or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Gollum's file handling mechanisms for attachments or includes, specifically the logic that resolves file paths.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all file paths provided by users within Gollum's file handling components.
*   Use absolute paths or a whitelist of allowed directories for file attachments and includes within Gollum's configuration.
*   Ensure that the user running the Gollum process has the minimum necessary permissions to access files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Gollum's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_gollum's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Gollum relies on various third-party libraries and components (e.g., Ruby gems, Markdown parsers). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, when exploited, directly impact the Gollum application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from remote code execution to information disclosure or denial of service, directly compromising the Gollum application.

**Affected Component:** Any of Gollum's dependencies that have a security vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Gollum and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for known vulnerabilities in Gollum's dependencies.
*   Follow security best practices for managing dependencies in the development environment.
