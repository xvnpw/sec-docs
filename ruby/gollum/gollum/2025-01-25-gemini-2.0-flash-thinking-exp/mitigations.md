## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Markdown Output within Gollum](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_markdown_output_within_gollum.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Sanitize Markdown Output within Gollum

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Gollum's Markdown Renderer:** Determine which Markdown renderer Gollum is configured to use. Gollum supports various renderers (e.g., `kramdown`, `redcarpet`, `rdiscount`). Check Gollum's configuration files or settings to identify the active renderer.
    2.  **Configure Renderer Sanitization:**  Consult the documentation for the specific Markdown renderer used by Gollum. Look for configuration options related to HTML sanitization.
        *   **For `kramdown`:**  Kramdown has built-in sanitization. Ensure it's enabled and potentially configure the `html_use_syntax_highlighter` option carefully if syntax highlighting is used, as it might introduce complexities.
        *   **For `redcarpet`:** Redcarpet offers options like `escape_html` or requires using a separate sanitization library in conjunction. Configure Redcarpet or integrate a sanitization library (like `sanitize` gem) within Gollum's rendering pipeline if needed.
        *   **For other renderers:**  Refer to their respective documentation for sanitization capabilities.
    3.  **Verify Sanitization Effectiveness:** After configuring sanitization, test it by creating Gollum pages with potentially malicious Markdown content, such as:
        *   `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
        *   `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`
        *   Links with `javascript:` URLs.
        Inspect the rendered HTML output in the browser's developer tools to confirm that harmful HTML tags and attributes are properly escaped or removed.
    4.  **Regularly Review Renderer Configuration:** Periodically review the sanitization configuration of Gollum's Markdown renderer, especially after Gollum or renderer updates, to ensure it remains effective and aligned with security best practices.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown: Severity: High
    *   HTML Injection: Severity: Medium
    *   Content Spoofing/Defacement: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown: High reduction
    *   HTML Injection: Medium reduction
    *   Content Spoofing/Defacement: Medium reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Gollum likely uses a Markdown renderer with *some* default sanitization. However, the specific configuration and effectiveness are not explicitly verified or hardened.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit review and hardening of Gollum's Markdown renderer sanitization configuration.  Formal testing process to validate sanitization against known XSS vectors in Markdown within the Gollum context. Documentation of the specific sanitization settings used in Gollum.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Gollum's User Management](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_gollum's_user_management.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Gollum's User Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Gollum's Built-in RBAC (if any):** Investigate if Gollum provides any built-in mechanisms for user roles and permissions.  Refer to Gollum's documentation and configuration options to understand its user management capabilities.  Gollum's core might be quite basic in this area, potentially requiring plugins or custom code.
    2.  **Define Roles and Permissions for Gollum:** If Gollum supports RBAC, define the necessary roles (e.g., `viewer`, `editor`, `admin`) and the specific actions each role is allowed to perform within Gollum (e.g., view pages, edit pages, delete pages, manage wiki settings, manage users - if Gollum provides user management).
    3.  **Configure Gollum's RBAC:** Configure Gollum to enforce the defined roles and permissions. This might involve:
        *   **Configuration Files:** Modifying Gollum's configuration files to define roles and map users to roles.
        *   **Plugins/Extensions:** Installing and configuring Gollum plugins that enhance user management and RBAC.
        *   **Custom Code (if necessary):**  If Gollum's built-in RBAC is insufficient, consider developing custom code or modifications to Gollum to implement the required role-based access control logic. This would likely involve modifying Gollum's authentication and authorization modules.
    4.  **Test and Verify RBAC Enforcement:** Thoroughly test the implemented RBAC to ensure that permissions are correctly enforced. Verify that users in different roles can only access and perform actions according to their assigned permissions within Gollum.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Content Modification within Gollum: Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Wiki Content within Gollum: Severity: Medium
    *   Privilege Escalation within Gollum: Severity: Medium
    *   Data Breach (Internal Wiki Content) via Gollum: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Content Modification within Gollum: High reduction
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Wiki Content within Gollum: Medium reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation within Gollum: Medium reduction
    *   Data Breach (Internal Wiki Content) via Gollum: Medium reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely No or Very Basic - Gollum's core might have minimal user management, possibly just authentication.  Fine-grained RBAC is probably not implemented out-of-the-box and would require significant customization or plugins.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Assessment of Gollum's RBAC capabilities. Definition of roles and permissions specific to wiki operations. Implementation of RBAC within Gollum (configuration, plugins, or custom code). Testing and verification of RBAC enforcement within Gollum.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates and Vulnerability Scanning for Gollum's Gems](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates_and_vulnerability_scanning_for_gollum's_gems.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regular Dependency Updates and Vulnerability Scanning for Gollum's Gems

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Bundler for Gollum:** Ensure Gollum's dependencies are managed using Bundler (as is typical for Ruby applications).  A `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` should be present in the Gollum project.
    2.  **Establish a Gem Update Schedule:** Create a schedule for regularly updating Gollum's Ruby gem dependencies.  Aim for at least monthly updates, or more frequently for critical security updates.
    3.  **Use `bundle outdated --patch` and `bundle update`:**  For patch-level updates, use `bundle outdated --patch` to identify gems with available patch releases and then `bundle update --patch`. For minor and major updates, use `bundle update` cautiously, testing thoroughly after updates.
    4.  **Integrate `bundler-audit` (or similar) into Gollum's Workflow:** Integrate `bundler-audit` (or another Ruby dependency vulnerability scanner like `gemnasium` or Snyk if compatible with Ruby/Bundler) into your development and CI/CD process for Gollum.
    5.  **Automate Gem Vulnerability Scanning:**  Automate the `bundler-audit` scan to run regularly (e.g., daily or on each commit/pull request for Gollum).
    6.  **Remediate Gem Vulnerabilities Promptly:** When `bundler-audit` (or your chosen scanner) reports vulnerabilities in Gollum's gems, prioritize remediation. Update the vulnerable gems to patched versions using Bundler. If updates are not immediately available, investigate workarounds or alternative gems if possible.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Gollum's Ruby Gem Dependencies: Severity: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks targeting Gollum's Gems: Severity: Medium
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Gems (Reduced Window of Exposure for Gollum): Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Gollum's Ruby Gem Dependencies: High reduction
    *   Supply Chain Attacks targeting Gollum's Gems: Medium reduction
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Gems (Reduced Window of Exposure for Gollum): Medium reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Gollum likely uses Bundler for dependency management. Gems might be updated occasionally, but a formal schedule and automated vulnerability scanning are missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a regular gem update schedule for Gollum. Integration of `bundler-audit` (or similar) into Gollum's development/CI/CD workflow. Automation of gem vulnerability scanning for Gollum. Formal process for prompt remediation of gem vulnerabilities in Gollum.
