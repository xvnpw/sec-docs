Okay, let's break down the "Macro-Related Vulnerabilities" threat in Gollum with a deep analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Macro-Related Vulnerabilities in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly understand the nature of macro-related vulnerabilities in Gollum, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and refine mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for developers to enhance Gollum's security against this threat.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on vulnerabilities arising from the use of custom macros within Gollum.  It encompasses:
    *   Gollum's core macro processing engine (how it loads, parses, and executes macros).
    *   The interaction between Gollum and the macros (data flow, input/output handling).
    *   The potential for vulnerabilities *within* custom macro code itself.
    *   The impact of these vulnerabilities on the Gollum server and its users.
    *   We will *not* analyze vulnerabilities in Gollum unrelated to macros (e.g., general XSS in page content rendering, unless triggered by a macro).

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the relevant sections of the Gollum source code (primarily Ruby files related to macro processing) to identify potential weaknesses.  This includes looking for:
        *   Insecure use of `eval` or similar functions.
        *   Lack of input validation or sanitization.
        *   Insufficient output encoding.
        *   Potential for code injection.
        *   Access to dangerous system functions or resources.
    2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will construct test cases with various malicious macro payloads to observe Gollum's behavior.  This includes:
        *   Attempting XSS attacks via macro output.
        *   Trying to achieve remote code execution (RCE) through crafted macro input.
        *   Testing for information disclosure vulnerabilities.
        *   Evaluating the effectiveness of existing security measures.
    3.  **Literature Review:** We will research known vulnerabilities in similar wiki systems or Ruby libraries that might be relevant to Gollum's macro implementation.
    4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:** Based on the findings from the code review, dynamic analysis, and literature review, we will refine the initial threat model, providing more specific details and actionable recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 2.1.  Code Review (Static Analysis) - Key Areas of Concern

Let's examine hypothetical (but realistic) scenarios based on how Gollum *might* handle macros.  We'll assume Gollum has a `MacroProcessor` class.

*   **Scenario 1:  Insecure `eval` Usage**

    ```ruby
    # Hypothetical Gollum MacroProcessor (Vulnerable)
    class MacroProcessor
      def process(macro_name, macro_args)
        # ... (some code to find the macro definition) ...
        macro_code = get_macro_code(macro_name)
        eval(macro_code + "(#{macro_args})") # DANGEROUS!
      end
    end
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Direct use of `eval` with potentially attacker-controlled input (`macro_code` and `macro_args`) is a major RCE vulnerability.  An attacker could craft a macro name or arguments that, when concatenated, form malicious Ruby code.
    *   **Example Attack:**  If an attacker can create a macro named `evil` with code `system`, and then call it with arguments like `rm -rf /`, the `eval` might execute `system("rm -rf /")`, causing catastrophic damage.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid `eval` entirely if possible.  If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, use a safer alternative like a dedicated templating engine with strict sandboxing or a domain-specific language (DSL) interpreter.

*   **Scenario 2:  Lack of Input Validation**

    ```ruby
    # Hypothetical Gollum Macro (Vulnerable)
    def my_macro(username)
      "<p>Hello, #{username}!</p>" # No sanitization!
    end
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:**  The `username` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output without any sanitization or encoding.  This is a classic XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example Attack:**  An attacker could create a wiki page with `<<my_macro("<script>alert('XSS')</script>")>>`.  When Gollum renders this page, the injected JavaScript will execute.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a robust HTML escaping/sanitization library (like `CGI.escapeHTML` in Ruby) to encode the `username` before embedding it in the HTML:
        ```ruby
        def my_macro(username)
          "<p>Hello, #{CGI.escapeHTML(username)}!</p>"
        ```

*   **Scenario 3:  Insufficient Output Encoding (Gollum's Responsibility)**

    ```ruby
    # Hypothetical Gollum MacroProcessor (Vulnerable)
    class MacroProcessor
      def process(macro_name, macro_args)
        macro_code = get_macro_code(macro_name)
        result = macro_code.call(macro_args) # Assume macro returns HTML
        result # Directly return the result without encoding
      end
    end
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:** Even if the *macro* itself attempts some sanitization, Gollum should *always* encode the final output of the macro before inserting it into the page.  This acts as a final defense against XSS.
    *   **Example Attack:**  A macro might try to sanitize input but miss an edge case.  Gollum's lack of output encoding would allow the XSS to succeed.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Gollum's `MacroProcessor` (or the relevant rendering component) should *always* apply HTML escaping to the result of the macro:
        ```ruby
        class MacroProcessor
          def process(macro_name, macro_args)
            macro_code = get_macro_code(macro_name)
            result = macro_code.call(macro_args)
            CGI.escapeHTML(result) # Encode the output
          end
        end
        ```

*   **Scenario 4:  Access to Dangerous Functions**

    ```ruby
    # Hypothetical Gollum Macro (Vulnerable)
    def file_read_macro(filename)
      File.read(filename) # DANGEROUS!
    end
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:**  The macro has unrestricted access to the file system.  An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Example Attack:**  `<<file_read_macro("/etc/passwd")>>` would attempt to read the system's password file.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Macros should *not* have direct access to `File`, `IO`, `system`, `exec`, `backticks`, or any other methods that allow interaction with the operating system.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  If file access is required, provide a highly restricted, sandboxed API that only allows access to specific, pre-approved files or directories.  This might involve creating a custom `SafeFile` class that wraps `File` and enforces strict access controls.

#### 2.2. Dynamic Analysis (Testing)

We would perform the following tests (and many more variations):

*   **XSS Tests:**
    *   `<<my_macro("<script>alert('XSS')</script>")>>`
    *   `<<my_macro("<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>")>>`
    *   `<<my_macro("<a href='javascript:alert(1)'>Click Me</a>")>>`
    *   Test with various HTML tags, attributes, and event handlers known to be vectors for XSS.

*   **RCE Tests (if `eval` or similar is suspected):**
    *   Try to inject Ruby code that executes system commands (e.g., `ls`, `whoami`, `cat /etc/passwd`).
    *   Attempt to create, modify, or delete files.
    *   Try to establish network connections.

*   **Information Disclosure Tests:**
    *   Attempt to read sensitive files (if file access is suspected).
    *   Try to access environment variables or other server-side data.

*   **Bypass Tests:**
    *   If Gollum implements any sanitization or filtering, try to bypass it using techniques like:
        *   Double encoding (e.g., `%253C` for `<`).
        *   Using alternative character encodings.
        *   Exploiting parsing inconsistencies.

#### 2.3. Literature Review

We would research:

*   **Known vulnerabilities in other wiki engines:**  Look for CVEs related to macro processing in MediaWiki, DokuWiki, etc.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Ruby templating libraries:**  If Gollum uses a templating library for macros, research known vulnerabilities in that library.
*   **Best practices for secure macro implementation:**  Search for articles and guidelines on how to securely implement macros in web applications.

#### 2.4. Threat Modeling Refinement

Based on the above analysis, we can refine the initial threat model:

*   **Threat:** Macro-Related Vulnerabilities (Refined)

    *   **Description:**  Gollum's macro processing engine is vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the potential for insecure use of `eval` (or similar functions), insufficient input validation, inadequate output encoding, and unrestricted access to system resources within custom macros.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious wiki pages that utilize vulnerable macros.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  High probability if `eval` or similar is used insecurely.  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  High probability due to the potential for insufficient input validation and output encoding.  Allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the context of other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Possible if macros have unrestricted access to the file system or other sensitive data.  Allows attackers to read confidential information.

    *   **Affected Gollum Component:**
        *   `lib/gollum/macro.rb` (or similar file containing the macro processing logic).
        *   Any files containing custom macro definitions.
        *   The rendering engine that processes macro output.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (due to the potential for RCE)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Refined and Prioritized):**
        1.  **Eliminate `eval` (or similar):**  This is the *highest priority*.  Replace `eval` with a safe alternative like a sandboxed templating engine or a DSL interpreter.
        2.  **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Validate *all* input to macros, both within Gollum's core and within the macro definitions themselves.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible (allow only known-good characters/patterns).
        3.  **Enforce Strict Output Encoding:**  Gollum *must* HTML-encode the output of *all* macros before rendering them in the page.  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Macros should have *no* direct access to system resources (files, network, etc.).  If such access is required, provide a highly restricted, sandboxed API.
        5.  **Sandboxing (if feasible):**  Explore options for running macros in a sandboxed environment (e.g., using a separate process with limited privileges).
        6.  **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of both Gollum's macro handling code and *all* custom macro definitions.
        7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
        8.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the security implications of using custom macros and provide guidance to users on how to write secure macros.
        9. **Dependency Management:** Keep the dependencies updated.

### 3. Conclusion

Macro-related vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to Gollum installations, potentially leading to RCE and XSS attacks.  By addressing the vulnerabilities identified in this deep analysis and implementing the refined mitigation strategies, developers can significantly enhance Gollum's security posture and protect users from these threats. The most critical step is to eliminate the use of `eval` or similar functions in the macro processing logic and replace it with a safer alternative.  A combination of secure coding practices, rigorous testing, and regular security audits is essential to maintain a secure wiki environment.
