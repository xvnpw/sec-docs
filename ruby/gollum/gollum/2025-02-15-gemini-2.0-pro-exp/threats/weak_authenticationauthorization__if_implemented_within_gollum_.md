Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Weak Authentication/Authorization (if implemented *within* Gollum)" threat, structured as requested:

## Deep Analysis: Weak Authentication/Authorization in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the potential vulnerabilities related to weak authentication and authorization mechanisms *if they are implemented directly within the Gollum wiki software*.  This analysis aims to identify specific code-level weaknesses, assess their exploitability, and refine mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already provided in the threat model.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that if Gollum handles authentication/authorization, it does so securely, or to strongly recommend and justify the use of external authentication.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses *exclusively* on authentication and authorization logic *implemented within the Gollum codebase itself*.  It does *not* cover vulnerabilities in external authentication systems (like LDAP or OAuth providers) that Gollum might integrate with.  The scope includes:
    *   Code responsible for user authentication (if present).
    *   Code responsible for authorization checks (determining user permissions).
    *   Code related to session management (if Gollum handles sessions directly).
    *   Configuration options related to authentication and authorization.
    *   Any supporting libraries used for these functions *that are bundled with or directly depended upon by Gollum*.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review:**  A detailed manual review of the Gollum source code (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gollum/gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)) will be the primary method.  This will involve searching for:
        *   Authentication-related functions (e.g., login, password validation, user creation).
        *   Authorization-related functions (e.g., permission checks, access control lists).
        *   Session management functions (e.g., session creation, validation, destruction).
        *   Known vulnerable patterns (e.g., hardcoded credentials, weak hashing algorithms, insecure random number generation).
        *   Use of outdated or vulnerable libraries.
    2.  **Static Analysis:**  Automated static analysis tools (e.g., Brakeman for Ruby, SonarQube) will be used to supplement the manual code review.  These tools can identify potential security issues that might be missed during manual inspection.
    3.  **Dynamic Analysis (if applicable):** If Gollum has built-in authentication, and if a test environment can be easily set up, dynamic analysis (e.g., using a web vulnerability scanner like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite) will be performed to test for vulnerabilities like brute-force attacks, session fixation, and privilege escalation.  This is *contingent* on Gollum having its own authentication.
    4.  **Documentation Review:**  Gollum's official documentation will be reviewed to understand the intended authentication and authorization mechanisms, configuration options, and any security recommendations.
    5.  **Issue Tracker Review:**  Gollum's issue tracker on GitHub will be searched for any previously reported security vulnerabilities related to authentication or authorization.
    6. **Dependency Analysis:** Investigate the security posture of any libraries Gollum uses for authentication, authorization, or session management.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Based on the threat model and initial understanding, here's a breakdown of the specific areas of concern and analysis steps:

**2.1.  Authentication Weaknesses (if implemented within Gollum):**

*   **2.1.1. Password Storage:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Storing passwords in plain text, using weak hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1), or using hashing without salting.
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Search for code that handles password storage and retrieval.  Identify the hashing algorithm used.  Check for the presence and proper use of salts. Look for database interactions related to user accounts.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Configure tools to flag weak hashing algorithms and insecure password storage practices.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.  Ensure that a unique, randomly generated salt is used for each password.

*   **2.1.2. Password Reset:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Weak password reset mechanisms that are susceptible to account takeover (e.g., predictable reset tokens, insecure email-based reset).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles password reset requests, token generation, and email sending.  Look for potential vulnerabilities like predictable token generation, lack of rate limiting, and insufficient token validation.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to exploit the password reset functionality to gain unauthorized access to an account.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use cryptographically secure random number generators for token generation.  Implement short-lived, single-use tokens.  Send reset links via a secure channel (HTTPS).  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

*   **2.1.3. Brute-Force Protection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of protection against brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to repeatedly guess passwords.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check for the presence of account lockout mechanisms, rate limiting, or CAPTCHA implementation.  Analyze the authentication logic to see how failed login attempts are handled.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt a brute-force attack against a test account to assess the effectiveness of any protection mechanisms.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.  Introduce delays between login attempts.  Consider using CAPTCHA or other challenges to distinguish between human users and bots.

*   **2.1.4. Authentication Bypass:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Flaws in the authentication logic that allow attackers to bypass authentication entirely (e.g., SQL injection, path traversal).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Carefully examine the authentication logic for any potential injection vulnerabilities or other flaws that could allow an attacker to bypass the checks.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Configure tools to flag potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to bypass authentication using various techniques.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  Sanitize and validate all user input.  Implement robust input validation and output encoding.

**2.2. Authorization Weaknesses (if implemented within Gollum):**

*   **2.2.1. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allowing users to access or modify resources they shouldn't have access to by manipulating identifiers (e.g., page IDs, user IDs).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how Gollum handles access control to wiki pages and other resources.  Look for code that uses user-supplied input to directly access resources without proper authorization checks.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to access or modify resources belonging to other users by manipulating identifiers.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust access control checks based on the user's role and permissions, not just on user-supplied identifiers.  Use indirect object references (e.g., session-based mappings) instead of directly exposing internal identifiers.

*   **2.2.2. Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allowing users to gain higher privileges than they should have (e.g., a regular user becoming an administrator).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles user roles and permissions.  Look for any flaws that could allow a user to elevate their privileges.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to escalate privileges from a low-privilege account to a higher-privilege account.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement a clear and well-defined role-based access control (RBAC) system.  Ensure that all privilege changes are properly validated and authorized.

*   **2.2.3. Missing Function Level Access Control:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Failing to enforce authorization checks on all relevant functions or operations (e.g., allowing unauthenticated users to edit pages).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Ensure that *every* function that accesses or modifies wiki data has appropriate authorization checks.  Look for any "hidden" or undocumented functionality that might bypass these checks.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to perform various actions (e.g., editing, deleting, creating pages) without being properly authenticated or authorized.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement a consistent and comprehensive authorization framework that applies to all relevant functions.  Use a "deny by default" approach, explicitly granting access only to authorized users.

**2.3. Session Management Weaknesses (if handled by Gollum):**

*   **2.3.1. Session Fixation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allowing an attacker to fixate a user's session ID, potentially hijacking their session after they authenticate.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how Gollum generates and manages session IDs.  Check if the session ID is regenerated after successful authentication.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to fixate a user's session ID and then hijack their session.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Regenerate the session ID after successful authentication.  Use secure, randomly generated session IDs.

*   **2.3.2. Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allowing an attacker to steal a user's session ID and impersonate them.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check if session IDs are transmitted securely (over HTTPS).  Check for vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) that could allow an attacker to steal session IDs.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to steal a user's session ID and use it to access their account.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use HTTPS for all communication.  Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.  Implement robust XSS protection.

*   **2.3.3. Weak Session ID Generation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Using predictable or easily guessable session IDs.
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Examine the code that generates session IDs. Check for the use of a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate session IDs. Ensure that session IDs are sufficiently long and random.

*   **2.3.4. Improper Session Termination:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Failing to properly invalidate sessions after logout or timeout.
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Examine the code that handles logout and session timeouts. Check if sessions are properly invalidated on the server-side.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Attempt to access the application after logging out or after the session timeout period.
    *   **Mitigation:** Invalidate sessions on the server-side after logout or timeout. Set appropriate session timeout values.

**2.4.  Emphasis on External Authentication:**

A crucial part of this analysis is to *strongly advocate for and justify the use of external authentication*.  The analysis will:

*   **Document the Complexity:**  Clearly demonstrate the complexity and potential pitfalls of implementing secure authentication and authorization within Gollum.
*   **Highlight the Benefits of External Systems:**  Emphasize the advantages of using well-established, battle-tested external authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, SAML) in terms of security, maintainability, and scalability.
*   **Provide Concrete Recommendations:**  Offer specific recommendations for integrating Gollum with external authentication systems, including configuration examples and best practices.
* **Assess Gollum's built in options:** If Gollum provides any built-in options, assess them and provide recommendations.

### 3. Expected Outcomes

This deep analysis will produce:

*   A detailed report outlining any identified vulnerabilities in Gollum's authentication and authorization mechanisms (if they exist).
*   Specific code examples and explanations of the vulnerabilities.
*   Prioritized recommendations for remediation, including code changes and configuration adjustments.
*   A strong justification for using external authentication, along with practical guidance for implementation.
*   Input for updating the threat model with more specific and actionable information.
*   Clear communication to the development team about the risks and the necessary steps to mitigate them.

This comprehensive analysis will significantly enhance the security posture of the Gollum-based application by addressing potential weaknesses in its authentication and authorization mechanisms. The focus on external authentication, if applicable, will provide a more robust and maintainable solution in the long run.
