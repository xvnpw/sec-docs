Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion" threat for a Gollum-based wiki application, following the structure you requested:

## Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the "Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion" threat against a Gollum wiki, identify specific vulnerabilities within Gollum's codebase and operational environment, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level suggestions in the initial threat model.  The goal is to provide the development team with the information needed to harden Gollum against this specific attack vector.

*   **Scope:**
    *   **Gollum Codebase:**  Focus on the `gollum/gollum` repository on GitHub, specifically versions that are currently supported and commonly deployed.  We will examine the core components identified in the threat model (`Gollum::Markup`, `Gollum::Page`, `Gollum::File`, and macro processing) and any related modules.
    *   **Dependencies:**  Analyze key dependencies that Gollum relies on for rendering and processing (e.g., underlying Markdown parsers, sanitization libraries) to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited through Gollum.
    *   **Deployment Environment:** Consider common deployment scenarios (e.g., running Gollum with Puma, Unicorn, or other application servers) and how these environments might influence the effectiveness of resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Exclusions:**  This analysis will *not* cover general web server DoS attacks (e.g., SYN floods, HTTP floods) that are outside the scope of Gollum's specific handling of input.  We assume basic web server security measures are in place.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review:**  Static analysis of the Gollum codebase (and relevant dependencies) to identify potential resource consumption hotspots.  This includes:
        *   Searching for loops, recursion, or complex operations that could be triggered by malicious input.
        *   Examining how Gollum handles large files, complex markup, and macro execution.
        *   Identifying areas where input validation and sanitization are missing or insufficient.
        *   Looking for potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage patterns.
    2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Investigate the security posture of Gollum's dependencies, looking for known vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be leveraged for resource exhaustion.  Tools like `bundler-audit` and vulnerability databases will be used.
    3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing):**  If feasible, perform dynamic testing, including fuzzing, to attempt to trigger resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.  This would involve crafting malicious inputs and monitoring Gollum's resource usage.  This step may be limited by time and resource constraints.
    4.  **Literature Review:**  Research known vulnerabilities and attack techniques related to Markdown parsing, wiki engines, and Ruby applications to identify potential attack vectors.
    5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Based on the findings from the above steps, refine the initial mitigation strategies into more specific and actionable recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Based on the threat model and the methodology outlined above, here's a deeper dive into the specific areas of concern and potential vulnerabilities:

**2.1.  `Gollum::Markup` and Rendering Engine:**

*   **Markdown Parsers:** Gollum uses different Markdown parsers (like Kramdown, Redcarpet, etc.).  Each parser has its own complexity and potential vulnerabilities.  A key area of investigation is how these parsers handle:
    *   **Deeply Nested Lists/Blockquotes:**  Excessive nesting can lead to exponential growth in processing time and memory usage.  We need to determine the maximum nesting depth allowed by each parser and whether this limit is enforced *before* significant resource consumption occurs.
    *   **Large Tables:**  Extremely wide or long tables can consume significant memory during rendering.
    *   **Complex Regular Expressions:**  Some Markdown features (e.g., link parsing) rely on regular expressions.  Maliciously crafted regular expressions ("Regular Expression Denial of Service" or ReDoS) can cause catastrophic backtracking and consume excessive CPU time.  We need to examine the regular expressions used by Gollum and its parsers for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **HTML Entities and Escaping:**  Improper handling of HTML entities and escaping can lead to vulnerabilities, including potential resource exhaustion if the escaping process itself is inefficient.
    *   **Image Processing:** If Gollum or its dependencies perform image resizing or processing, this could be a target for resource exhaustion.  Large image files or specially crafted images could consume excessive memory or CPU.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `Gollum::Markup` class and the specific parser implementations (e.g., `Kramdown::Parser::Kramdown`, `Redcarpet::Render::HTML`) for the vulnerabilities listed above.
    *   Look for any custom rendering logic within Gollum that might introduce additional vulnerabilities.
    *   Check for the presence of input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to the Markdown parser.

**2.2.  `Gollum::Page` and `Gollum::File`:**

*   **Large File Handling:**  Gollum's handling of large files (both wiki pages and attachments) is a critical area.
    *   **Memory Usage:**  Does Gollum load entire files into memory at once?  This could be disastrous for large files.  Streaming or chunked processing is essential.
    *   **Disk I/O:**  Excessive disk I/O operations (e.g., repeated reads or writes) can also lead to DoS.
    *   **File Upload Limits:**  Gollum should enforce strict limits on the size and number of file uploads to prevent attackers from filling up server storage.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `Gollum::Page` and `Gollum::File` classes for how they handle file reading, writing, and storage.
    *   Look for evidence of streaming or chunked processing.
    *   Identify any file size or upload limits and how they are enforced.

**2.3.  Macro Processing:**

*   **Custom Macro Security:**  Custom macros are a major potential vulnerability.  They allow users to execute arbitrary code (often Ruby) within the Gollum context.
    *   **Unsafe Operations:**  Macros could potentially perform system calls, access sensitive data, or consume excessive resources.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Macro arguments must be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and resource exhaustion.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Ideally, macros should be executed in a sandboxed environment to limit their capabilities and prevent them from harming the system.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the macro processing logic in Gollum (if any).
    *   If custom macros are supported, analyze the code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Look for input validation, sanitization, and any attempts at sandboxing.

**2.4.  Dependencies:**

*   **Vulnerable Libraries:**  Gollum relies on various Ruby gems (e.g., for Markdown parsing, sanitization, etc.).  These gems may have known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through Gollum.
*   **Dependency Analysis Tools:**  Use tools like `bundler-audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Pay close attention to libraries involved in parsing, rendering, and sanitization.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

**2.5.  Deployment Environment:**

*   **Application Server Configuration:**  The application server (e.g., Puma, Unicorn) used to run Gollum can significantly impact its resilience to DoS attacks.
    *   **Worker Processes:**  The number of worker processes and their resource limits (memory, CPU) should be carefully configured.
    *   **Timeouts:**  Request timeouts should be set appropriately to prevent long-running requests from tying up worker processes.
    *   **Queueing:**  The application server's request queue should be configured to handle a reasonable number of concurrent requests without excessive memory consumption.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Review the recommended configuration settings for the chosen application server.
    *   Implement monitoring to track resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks.

**2.6.  Specific Vulnerability Examples (Hypothetical):**

*   **Nested List DoS:**  An attacker creates a wiki page with thousands of nested list items.  The Markdown parser (e.g., Kramdown) attempts to process this, leading to exponential memory usage and eventually crashing the Gollum process.
*   **ReDoS in Link Parsing:**  An attacker crafts a wiki page with a specially designed link that triggers a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in the regular expression used to parse links.  This causes the Gollum process to consume 100% CPU for an extended period.
*   **Large File Upload:**  An attacker uploads a multi-gigabyte file as an attachment.  Gollum attempts to load the entire file into memory, exceeding the available RAM and causing the process to crash.
*   **Macro Resource Exhaustion:**  An attacker creates a custom macro that enters an infinite loop or allocates a large amount of memory.  This macro is triggered by a specially crafted wiki page, consuming all available resources.

### 3. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deeper analysis, here are more specific and actionable mitigation strategies:

*   **3.1.  Input Validation and Sanitization (Gollum-Specific):**
    *   **Maximum Nesting Depth:**  Implement a hard limit on the nesting depth of lists, blockquotes, and other nested elements *within Gollum*, before passing the input to the Markdown parser.  This limit should be configurable.
    *   **Maximum Table Size:**  Limit the number of rows and columns in tables *within Gollum*.
    *   **Regular Expression Auditing:**  Thoroughly review all regular expressions used by Gollum and its dependencies for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  Use tools like RegExr or online ReDoS checkers to test suspicious patterns.  Consider using a safer regular expression engine if necessary.
    *   **Input Length Limits:**  Enforce maximum length limits on various input fields (page content, titles, macro arguments) *within Gollum*.
    *   **Character Restrictions:**  Restrict the allowed characters in certain input fields (e.g., filenames, macro names) to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **HTML Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., `sanitize` gem) *after* Markdown parsing to remove any potentially dangerous HTML tags or attributes. Configure the sanitizer with a strict whitelist of allowed elements and attributes.

*   **3.2.  Resource Limits (Gollum Process):**
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Use OS-level tools (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux, `rlimit` in Ruby) to set a maximum memory limit for the Gollum process.
    *   **CPU Time Limits:**  Set CPU time limits for the Gollum process to prevent it from monopolizing the CPU.
    *   **Process Limits:** Limit the number of child processes that Gollum can create (if applicable).

*   **3.3.  Macro Security (Gollum-Specific):**
    *   **Disable Custom Macros (if possible):**  If custom macros are not essential, disable them entirely to eliminate this attack vector.
    *   **Strict Macro Whitelist:**  If custom macros are required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed macro names and functions.
    *   **Macro Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all macro arguments *within Gollum* before passing them to the macro code.
    *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):**  Explore options for sandboxing macro execution.  This could involve:
        *   Using a separate Ruby process with limited privileges.
        *   Using a gem like `safe_ruby` (although its effectiveness may be limited).
        *   Using a containerization technology (e.g., Docker) to isolate macro execution.
    *   **Resource Limits within Macros:**  Even with sandboxing, enforce resource limits (memory, CPU time) *within* the macro execution environment.

*   **3.4.  Timeout Mechanisms (Gollum-Specific):**
    *   **Rendering Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for Markdown rendering and macro execution *within Gollum*.  If a rendering operation takes longer than a specified threshold, terminate it and return an error.
    *   **File Operation Timeouts:**  Set timeouts for file read/write operations to prevent them from blocking indefinitely.

*   **3.5.  Rate Limiting (Gollum-Specific):**
    *   **Page Edit Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of page edits a user can make within a given time period *within Gollum*.
    *   **Macro Execution Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of times a user can trigger macro execution within a given time period *within Gollum*.
    *   **File Upload Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number and size of file uploads a user can make within a given time period *within Gollum*.
    *   **Consider using a gem like `rack-attack` to implement rate limiting at the Rack middleware level, but customize it to target Gollum-specific actions.**

*   **3.6.  Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Use `bundle update` to keep Gollum's dependencies up to date.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use `bundler-audit` or similar tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:**  Consider pinning dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected changes from introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **3.7.  Deployment and Monitoring:**
    *   **Application Server Configuration:**  Configure the application server (Puma, Unicorn, etc.) with appropriate worker process settings, timeouts, and queueing mechanisms.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring to track Gollum's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic).  Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus.
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to help mitigate some DoS attacks, although it won't protect against vulnerabilities specific to Gollum's internal processing.

*   **3.8  Large File Handling:**
    * **Streaming:** Implement streaming or chunked processing for large files to avoid loading entire files into memory.
    * **File Size Limits:** Enforce strict file size limits for both page content and attachments.
    * **Asynchronous Processing:** For large file operations, consider using background jobs or asynchronous processing to avoid blocking the main Gollum process.

This refined set of mitigation strategies provides a much more concrete and actionable plan for addressing the "Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion" threat in Gollum. The key is to implement these mitigations *within Gollum itself*, in addition to any general web server security measures. The most important are input validation, resource limits, and careful handling of macros.
