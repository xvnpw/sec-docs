Okay, let's break down this threat analysis of Gollum's file handling.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized File Upload/Access in Gollum

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Unauthorized File Upload/Access" threat within the Gollum wiki application, focusing specifically on vulnerabilities *within Gollum's code* related to file handling.  We aim to identify specific code paths, potential weaknesses, and concrete attack scenarios that could lead to unauthorized file uploads or access, bypassing intended security measures.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden Gollum against these threats.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the file upload and access control mechanisms *implemented within the Gollum application itself*.  We will examine:

*   **Gollum's Ruby code:**  Specifically, the `Gollum::File` class and any related modules or functions that handle file uploads, storage, retrieval, and access control.  We will analyze how Gollum processes file uploads, determines file types, stores files, generates URLs, and enforces access restrictions.
*   **Gollum's configuration options related to file handling:**  We will examine how configuration settings (e.g., allowed file types, storage paths) interact with the code and influence security.
*   **Gollum's interaction with the underlying Git repository:**  While the Git repository itself is not the primary focus, we will consider how Gollum's interaction with Git might introduce vulnerabilities related to file handling.
*   **Gollum's dependencies:** We will briefly consider if any of Gollum's dependencies have known vulnerabilities related to file handling.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **General web server misconfiguration:**  This analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities arising from misconfigured web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or operating system-level file permissions.  We assume the web server is configured securely *except* where Gollum's code directly influences that configuration.
*   **Network-level attacks:**  We are not focusing on attacks like man-in-the-middle or denial-of-service.
*   **Client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) *unless* they are directly related to file upload/access:**  While XSS could be a *consequence* of a malicious file upload, our primary focus is on preventing the upload itself.
*   **Brute-force attacks on user authentication:** We assume user authentication is handled separately and securely.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a thorough manual code review of the relevant Gollum source code (primarily `Gollum::File` and related components) from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/gollum/gollum).  We will use static analysis techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (if feasible):**  If possible, we will set up a local Gollum instance and perform dynamic testing, attempting to upload malicious files and bypass access controls. This will involve crafting specific payloads and observing Gollum's behavior.
3.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will review Gollum's dependencies (listed in its `Gemfile` or similar) for any known vulnerabilities related to file handling.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the provided threat description as a starting point and expand upon it, considering various attack vectors and scenarios.
5.  **Documentation Review:** We will review Gollum's official documentation to understand the intended security model and configuration options related to file handling.
6.  **Issue Tracker Review:** We will search Gollum's issue tracker on GitHub for any existing reports of similar vulnerabilities.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Based on the threat description and our understanding of Gollum, here are some specific attack vectors and scenarios we will investigate:

*   **File Extension Bypass:**
    *   **Scenario:** Gollum relies solely on file extensions to determine file type. An attacker uploads a file named `malicious.php.jpg`.  If Gollum only checks the last extension (`.jpg`), it might allow the upload, but the web server (if misconfigured or if Gollum serves the file directly) might execute it as PHP code.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine how Gollum extracts and validates file extensions. Look for functions like `File.extname` or custom parsing logic.  Check if it handles multiple extensions correctly.
    *   **Mitigation:** Gollum should use "magic numbers" (file signatures) to determine the file type, *not* just the extension.  It should also have a strict whitelist of allowed extensions.

*   **File Content Spoofing:**
    *   **Scenario:** Gollum attempts to validate file content but uses a weak or easily bypassed method.  An attacker uploads a PHP file disguised as a GIF by adding a GIF header.  If Gollum's content validation is superficial, it might be fooled.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine how Gollum performs content validation.  Look for libraries or functions used for this purpose (e.g., `file` command, custom header checks).  Assess the robustness of these methods.
    *   **Mitigation:** Gollum should use a robust library for content validation that examines the entire file structure, not just the beginning.

*   **Path Traversal:**
    *   **Scenario:** Gollum is vulnerable to path traversal during file upload or access.  An attacker uploads a file named `../../../../etc/passwd` or accesses a file using a similar path.  If Gollum doesn't properly sanitize file names and paths, it might allow writing to or reading from arbitrary locations on the file system.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine how Gollum constructs file paths for storage and retrieval.  Look for any concatenation of user-provided input with file paths.  Check for proper sanitization and validation of file names.
    *   **Mitigation:** Gollum should strictly sanitize file names and paths, removing any characters that could be used for path traversal (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`).  It should also use a well-defined base directory for file storage and ensure that all file operations are confined to that directory.

*   **Direct Access to Uploaded Files:**
    *   **Scenario:** Gollum stores uploaded files in a web-accessible directory without proper access control.  An attacker can directly access uploaded files by guessing or constructing their URLs.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine how Gollum generates file names and URLs.  Check if the file names are predictable or easily guessable.  Review how Gollum serves files and whether it enforces access control at the application level.
    *   **Mitigation:** Gollum should generate random, unpredictable file names.  It should store files in a directory that is *not* directly web-accessible.  Gollum should be responsible for serving files through its own code, enforcing access control based on user permissions.

*   **Missing Access Control Checks:**
    *   **Scenario:** Gollum fails to properly check user permissions before allowing access to uploaded files.  An unauthenticated or unauthorized user can access files that should be restricted.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine the code that handles file downloads and access.  Look for explicit checks for user authentication and authorization.  Check how Gollum determines which users have access to which files.
    *   **Mitigation:** Gollum should implement robust access control checks at the application level, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific files.  This should be integrated with Gollum's user authentication and permission system.

*   **Race Conditions:**
    *   **Scenario:**  A race condition exists in Gollum's file upload or access control logic.  An attacker can exploit this to upload a malicious file or access a file they shouldn't have access to.  This is less likely but still worth considering.
    *   **Code to Review:**  Examine the file upload and access control code for any potential race conditions, especially if there are multiple steps involved (e.g., checking permissions, creating the file, writing data).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use appropriate locking mechanisms or atomic operations to prevent race conditions.

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Scenario:** A library that Gollum uses for file handling (e.g image processing) has a known vulnerability.
    * **Code to Review:** Examine `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
    * **Mitigation:** Keep dependencies up to date.

**2.2. Specific Code Areas to Investigate (Hypothetical Examples):**

Based on the attack vectors, here are some hypothetical code snippets (in Ruby, similar to what might be found in Gollum) and how they could be vulnerable:

**Vulnerable Example 1: Extension-Based Validation (Bad)**

```ruby
def allowed_file?(filename)
  allowed_extensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif']
  extension = File.extname(filename).downcase
  allowed_extensions.include?(extension)
end
```

**Vulnerability:**  This code only checks the last extension.  An attacker could upload `malicious.php.jpg`.

**Vulnerable Example 2: Weak Content Validation (Bad)**

```ruby
def is_image?(file_path)
  File.open(file_path, 'rb') do |file|
    header = file.read(8) # Only reads the first 8 bytes
    return header.start_with?("\x89PNG") || header.start_with?("GIF8")
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:**  This code only checks the first few bytes of the file.  An attacker could easily craft a malicious file with a fake header.

**Vulnerable Example 3: Path Traversal (Bad)**

```ruby
def save_file(filename, content)
  upload_dir = "/var/www/gollum/uploads"
  file_path = File.join(upload_dir, filename)
  File.open(file_path, 'wb') do |file|
    file.write(content)
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:**  This code directly uses the user-provided `filename` to construct the file path.  An attacker could use `../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Vulnerable Example 4: Missing Access Control (Bad)**

```ruby
def serve_file(filename)
  file_path = File.join("/var/www/gollum/uploads", filename)
  send_file file_path # Rails helper, but Gollum might use something similar
end
```

**Vulnerability:**  This code doesn't check if the current user has permission to access the file.

**2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

The mitigation strategies outlined in the original threat description are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **File Type Whitelisting (within Gollum):**
    *   **Implementation:** Gollum should maintain a strict whitelist of allowed file types, defined in a configuration file or a constant.  This whitelist should be *minimal*, including only the file types that are absolutely necessary.
    *   **Enforcement:**  Before storing any uploaded file, Gollum should check the file type against the whitelist.  If the file type is not on the whitelist, the upload should be rejected.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = {
          'image/jpeg' => '.jpg',
          'image/png'  => '.png',
          'image/gif'  => '.gif',
          'text/plain' => '.txt',
          # ... other allowed types ...
        }
        ```

*   **File Content Validation (within Gollum):**
    *   **Implementation:** Gollum should use a reliable library (e.g., `mimemagic` gem in Ruby) to determine the file type based on its content ("magic numbers"), *not* just the extension.
    *   **Enforcement:**  After determining the file type based on content, Gollum should compare it to the allowed file types (from the whitelist).  If there's a mismatch, the upload should be rejected.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        require 'mimemagic'

        def valid_file_content?(file_path)
          mime_type = MimeMagic.by_path(file_path).type
          ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES.key?(mime_type)
        end
        ```

*   **Secure Storage (Gollum's responsibility):**
    *   **Implementation:** Gollum should be configured to store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* directly accessible via the web server.  This directory should have appropriate file system permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Enforcement:** Gollum should *never* serve files directly from this directory.  Instead, it should use its own code to read the file and send it to the client (with proper access control).

*   **Randomized File Names (generated by Gollum):**
    *   **Implementation:** Gollum should use a secure random number generator (e.g., `SecureRandom.hex` in Ruby) to generate unique file names.  These file names should be long enough to prevent collisions.
    *   **Enforcement:**  The original file name provided by the user should *never* be used directly as the file name on the server.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        require 'securerandom'

        def generate_safe_filename(original_filename)
          extension = File.extname(original_filename)
          "#{SecureRandom.hex(16)}#{extension}"
        end
        ```

*   **Access Control (within Gollum):**
    *   **Implementation:** Gollum should implement a robust access control system that determines which users have permission to view, download, or modify uploaded files.  This should be integrated with Gollum's existing user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Enforcement:**  Before serving any file, Gollum should check if the current user has the necessary permissions.  If not, the request should be denied.  This should be enforced *before* any file I/O operations.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        def can_access_file?(user, file_path)
          # Check user's permissions based on Gollum's access control rules
          # (This is a placeholder - the actual implementation would depend on Gollum's
          #  permission system)
          return true if user.admin?
          return false # Default deny
        end

        def serve_file(filename)
          file_path = ... # Determine the full file path
          if can_access_file?(current_user, file_path)
            send_file file_path, ... # Send the file with appropriate headers
          else
            render :forbidden, status: :forbidden # Or redirect to an error page
          end
        end
        ```

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

This deep analysis provides a framework for investigating the "Unauthorized File Upload/Access" threat in Gollum.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Gollum's code is the primary focus:**  We must analyze Gollum's Ruby code to identify and address vulnerabilities related to file handling.
*   **Multiple attack vectors exist:**  Attackers can exploit various weaknesses, including file extension bypass, content spoofing, path traversal, and missing access control checks.
*   **Robust mitigation strategies are essential:**  Gollum needs to implement file type whitelisting, content validation, secure storage, randomized file names, and strict access control *within its own code*.
*   **Dynamic testing is crucial:** If possible, dynamic testing with crafted payloads will help confirm the presence and exploitability of vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Code Review:**  Immediately conduct a thorough code review of `Gollum::File` and related components, focusing on the attack vectors and code examples outlined above.
2.  **Implement Robust Content Validation:**  Use a reliable library like `mimemagic` to determine file types based on content, not extensions.
3.  **Enforce Strict File Type Whitelisting:**  Define a minimal whitelist of allowed file types and enforce it rigorously.
4.  **Secure File Storage:**  Ensure uploaded files are stored in a non-web-accessible directory.
5.  **Generate Random File Names:**  Use a secure random number generator to create file names.
6.  **Implement and Enforce Access Control:**  Implement robust access control checks within Gollum's code to ensure only authorized users can access files.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Gollum to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.
8.  **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Gollum's dependencies to patch any known vulnerabilities.
9. **Consider Sandboxing:** For an extra layer of security, explore the possibility of sandboxing the file processing component, limiting its access to the rest of the system.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized file upload and access in Gollum, protecting the application and its users from potential attacks.
