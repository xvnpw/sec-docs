Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Secure Markup Rendering" mitigation strategy for Gollum.

## Deep Analysis: Secure Markup Rendering in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Secure Markup Rendering" mitigation strategy in preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection vulnerabilities within a Gollum wiki application.  We will assess the completeness of the strategy, identify potential weaknesses, and provide concrete recommendations for improvement, focusing on the *currently unimplemented* aspects.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses solely on the "Secure Markup Rendering" strategy as described.  It covers:

*   Updating Gollum and its dependencies.
*   Configuring the markup renderer (specifically `kramdown`).
*   Implementing HTML sanitization (using `bleach` as the recommended library).
*   Performing basic input validation.

The analysis will *not* cover other potential mitigation strategies (e.g., Content Security Policy, input validation at the web server level) except where they directly relate to the effectiveness of secure markup rendering.  It also assumes a standard Gollum setup without significant custom modifications (beyond those described in the strategy).

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Review the identified threats (XSS and HTML Injection) and how they manifest in a Gollum context.
2.  **Component Analysis:**  Examine each component of the mitigation strategy (dependency updates, renderer configuration, sanitization, input validation) individually.  This includes:
    *   **Code Review:**  Analyze the provided Ruby code snippets for correctness and potential bypasses.
    *   **Configuration Review:**  Evaluate the `kramdown` configuration for security implications.
    *   **Best Practices Comparison:**  Compare the strategy against industry best practices for secure markup handling.
    *   **Vulnerability Research:**  Check for known vulnerabilities in the recommended libraries (`kramdown`, `bleach`) and Gollum itself.
3.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identify any gaps or weaknesses in the strategy, particularly focusing on the "Missing Implementation" section.
4.  **Recommendation Synthesis:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations to address the identified gaps and improve the overall security posture.
5. **Testing Considerations:** Describe testing approach to verify effectiveness of mitigation strategy.

### 2. Threat Modeling

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker creates or edits a Gollum page, injecting malicious JavaScript code.  This code could be embedded within:
    *   Raw HTML tags (if allowed).
    *   Markdown constructs that are improperly rendered (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the Markdown parser).
    *   Attributes of allowed HTML tags (e.g., `onerror` in an `<img>` tag).
*   **Impact:** When a victim views the compromised page, the attacker's JavaScript executes in the victim's browser, potentially:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Defacing the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**HTML Injection:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to XSS, but the attacker injects arbitrary HTML (not necessarily including JavaScript).  This could be used to:
    *   Disrupt the page layout.
    *   Insert phishing forms.
    *   Embed malicious iframes.
*   **Impact:** While less severe than XSS, HTML injection can still compromise the integrity and usability of the wiki.

### 3. Component Analysis

**3.1 Dependency Updates:**

*   **Purpose:**  Ensures that Gollum and its rendering libraries are patched against known vulnerabilities.
*   **Effectiveness:**  Essential, but *reactive*.  Relies on timely updates and the discovery of vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:**  `bundle update` is the standard and correct way to update Ruby gems.
*   **Best Practices:**  Automated dependency updates (e.g., using Dependabot or similar tools) are highly recommended.  Regular security audits of dependencies are also crucial.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Regularly checking for CVEs related to `gollum`, `github-markup`, `kramdown`, and `bleach` is necessary.
* **Currently Implemented:** Partially, periodic, not automated.

**3.2 Renderer Configuration (`kramdown`):**

*   **Purpose:**  Disables unsafe features of the `kramdown` Markdown renderer.
*   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective *if configured correctly*.  The provided configuration is a good starting point:
    ```ruby
    Gollum::Markup.formats[:markdown] = {
      :renderer => :kramdown,
      :options => { :input => 'GFM', :hard_wrap => false, :auto_ids => true, :parse_block_html => false, :parse_span_html => false, :html_to_native => false }
    }
    ```
    *   `:input => 'GFM'` (GitHub Flavored Markdown):  A relatively safe and well-defined Markdown dialect.
    *   `:parse_block_html => false` and `:parse_span_html => false`:  *Crucially* disables parsing of raw HTML, preventing a major XSS vector.
    *   `:html_to_native => false`: Prevents conversion of HTML entities.
*   **Code Review:**  The code is syntactically correct and follows Gollum's configuration API.
*   **Best Practices:**  This configuration aligns with best practices for secure Markdown rendering.  Regularly review the `kramdown` documentation for any new security-related options.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  While `kramdown` is generally considered secure, it's important to stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities.
* **Currently Implemented:** Yes.

**3.3 HTML Sanitization (`bleach`):**

*   **Purpose:**  Provides a *critical* layer of defense by sanitizing *any* HTML that might reach the rendering pipeline, even if raw HTML parsing is disabled.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Effectiveness:**  `bleach` is a well-regarded and actively maintained HTML sanitization library.  Its effectiveness depends *entirely* on the configuration (the whitelist of allowed tags and attributes).  The provided example is a good starting point, but *must* be carefully tailored:
    ```ruby
    require 'bleach'
    Gollum::Filter::Sanitize.sanitize_options = {
      :elements => ['a', 'p', 'code', 'pre', 'img', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'strong', 'em', 'br', 'table', 'thead', 'tbody', 'tr', 'th', 'td'], # Allowed tags
      :attributes => {
        'a' => ['href'],
        'img' => ['src', 'alt'],
        :all => ['class', 'id'] # Allowed attributes
      },
      :protocols => {
        'a' => {'href' => ['http', 'https', 'mailto', '#']} # Allowed protocols
      }
    }
    ```
    *   **Allowed Tags:**  The list is restrictive, which is good.  However, consider whether `img` is truly necessary.  If so, ensure the `src` attribute is strictly validated (see below).
    *   **Allowed Attributes:**  `href` for `a` tags and `src`, `alt` for `img` tags are common.  `class` and `id` are allowed for all tags, which is generally safe.
    *   **Allowed Protocols:**  Restricting `href` to `http`, `https`, `mailto`, and `#` prevents `javascript:` URLs, a common XSS vector.
*   **Code Review:**  The code correctly integrates `bleach` with Gollum's filter system.
*   **Best Practices:**  The whitelist approach is the recommended method for HTML sanitization.  The key is to be as restrictive as possible, only allowing what is absolutely necessary.  *Never* trust user-provided HTML.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  `bleach` itself is actively maintained, but vulnerabilities in underlying parsing libraries (like `html5lib`) could potentially affect it.  Stay informed.
* **Currently Implemented:** No. *Critical* missing piece.

**3.4 Input Validation (Limited):**

*   **Purpose:**  Provides a *supplementary* layer of defense by checking for obviously malicious patterns in page titles and filenames.
*   **Effectiveness:**  Limited.  Input validation is *not* a reliable defense against XSS or HTML injection.  It can catch simple attacks, but sophisticated attackers can easily bypass it.  It should *never* be the primary defense.
*   **Code Review:**  No specific code is provided, but the description mentions "basic sanitization of page titles."  This likely involves simple string replacements or regular expressions.  This is prone to errors and bypasses.
*   **Best Practices:**  Input validation should be used to enforce data format and length restrictions, *not* to prevent XSS.  Rely on output encoding and sanitization for security.
* **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic.

### 4. Gap Analysis

The most significant gap is the **lack of HTML sanitization**.  While the `kramdown` configuration disables raw HTML parsing, this is not sufficient for complete protection.  There are several reasons why sanitization is still crucial:

*   **Markdown Parser Vulnerabilities:**  Even if `kramdown` is currently secure, a future vulnerability could allow attackers to bypass the HTML restrictions.
*   **Markdown Extensions:**  If any Gollum extensions or custom code introduce additional Markdown features, these could inadvertently allow HTML injection.
*   **Future Gollum Changes:**  Changes to Gollum's core code could introduce new ways for HTML to be injected.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Sanitization provides an essential layer of defense, even if other measures are in place.

The lack of **automated dependency updates** is also a significant gap.  Manual updates are prone to being forgotten or delayed, leaving the system vulnerable to known exploits.

### 5. Recommendation Synthesis

1.  **Implement HTML Sanitization (High Priority):**  Integrate `bleach` (or a comparable, actively maintained HTML sanitization library) into Gollum as described in the strategy.  *Carefully* configure the whitelist of allowed tags and attributes to be as restrictive as possible.  Test thoroughly (see below).
2.  **Automate Dependency Updates (High Priority):**  Use a tool like Dependabot to automatically create pull requests when new versions of Gollum and its dependencies are available.  This ensures that security patches are applied promptly.
3.  **Review and Tighten Input Validation (Low Priority):**  While not a primary defense, ensure that input validation for page titles and filenames is robust and prevents obviously malicious patterns.  However, do *not* rely on this for security.
4.  **Regular Security Audits (Medium Priority):**  Conduct periodic security audits of the Gollum setup, including:
    *   Reviewing the `bleach` configuration.
    *   Checking for new vulnerabilities in Gollum and its dependencies.
    *   Testing for XSS and HTML injection vulnerabilities.
5.  **Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) (Medium Priority):**  While not part of the "Secure Markup Rendering" strategy, implementing a CSP can provide an additional layer of defense against XSS.  This is a separate mitigation strategy that should be considered.

### 6. Testing Considerations
To verify effectiveness of mitigation strategy, following testing approach should be used:

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   Create unit tests for the `bleach` integration to ensure that it correctly sanitizes various HTML inputs, including:
        *   Valid HTML that should be allowed.
        *   Invalid HTML that should be removed or escaped.
        *   HTML with potentially malicious attributes (e.g., `onerror`, `javascript:` URLs).
        *   Edge cases and boundary conditions.
2.  **Integration Tests:**
    *   Create integration tests that simulate user input and verify that the rendered output is safe.  This should include:
        *   Creating and editing pages with various Markdown and (if allowed) HTML content.
        *   Verifying that malicious JavaScript is not executed.
        *   Verifying that arbitrary HTML is not injected.
3.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct manual penetration testing to attempt to bypass the security measures.  This should be performed by someone with security expertise.
    *   Try various XSS and HTML injection techniques, including:
        *   Using different Markdown constructs.
        *   Exploiting potential vulnerabilities in `kramdown` or `bleach`.
        *   Attempting to bypass the input validation.
4. **Automated Security Scanners:**
    * Use automated security scanners to identify potential vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations and conducting thorough testing, the Gollum wiki application can be significantly hardened against XSS and HTML injection attacks. The most critical step is implementing the HTML sanitization using `bleach`.
