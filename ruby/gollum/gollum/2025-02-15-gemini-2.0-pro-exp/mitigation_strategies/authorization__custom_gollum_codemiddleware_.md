5.  **Implementation Considerations:** We will discuss practical challenges and considerations for implementing this strategy in a real-world environment.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Authorization Strategy

### 2.1 Technical Implementation Details

The core of the strategy is a Rack middleware (`GollumAuthorization`) that intercepts every request to the Gollum application.  This middleware performs the following steps:

1.  **User Retrieval:**  `get_user(env)` retrieves the authenticated user's identity from the request environment (`env`).  This assumes a prior authentication step (e.g., another middleware or authentication system) has already established the user's identity and stored it in a location accessible to `get_user`.  This is a *critical dependency*.
2.  **Resource Identification:** `env['PATH_INFO']` extracts the requested path (e.g., `/wiki/MyPage`).  This is used to determine which resource the user is attempting to access.
3.  **Authorization Check:** `user_has_permission?(user, path)` is the heart of the authorization logic.  This method (which is *not* fully defined in the example) is responsible for determining whether the given user has permission to access the requested resource.  This is where the complexity lies.
4.  **Decision and Enforcement:**
    *   If `user_has_permission?` returns `true`, the request is passed on to the Gollum application (`@app.call(env)`).
    *   If `user_has_permission?` returns `false`, a 403 Forbidden response is returned, preventing access.

**Key Implementation Considerations and Potential Weaknesses:**

*   **`get_user(env)` Implementation:**  The security of the entire authorization system hinges on the reliability and security of `get_user`.  If this method is vulnerable to tampering or spoofing, an attacker could impersonate any user.  Common vulnerabilities here include:
    *   **Session Fixation:**  If the user's identity is stored in a session, and the session ID is predictable or can be set by the attacker, they can hijack a legitimate user's session.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** If the user ID is passed directly in a parameter (e.g., a cookie or URL parameter) without proper validation, an attacker could change the ID to access another user's data.
    *   **Insufficient Authentication:** If the underlying authentication mechanism is weak (e.g., easily guessable passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication), the retrieved user identity may not be trustworthy.
*   **`user_has_permission?(user, path)` Implementation:** This is the most complex and crucial part.  Several factors need careful consideration:
    *   **Permission Storage:** How are user permissions stored?  Options include:
        *   **Database:**  A robust and scalable solution, but requires careful schema design and secure database access.
        *   **Configuration File:**  Simpler for small deployments, but can become unwieldy and difficult to manage for larger wikis with many users and permissions.  Also, requires secure file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
        *   **In-Memory Data Structure:**  Fastest, but requires careful synchronization and persistence if the application restarts.  Also, may not scale well.
    *   **Permission Model:**  What type of authorization model is used?
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Users are assigned roles (e.g., "editor," "viewer," "admin"), and permissions are granted to roles.  This is a common and generally recommended approach.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Each resource (e.g., page) has a list of users and their permitted actions.  This can be more granular than RBAC but can also become more complex to manage.
        *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**  Permissions are based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.  This is the most flexible but also the most complex to implement.
    *   **Granularity:** How granular are the permissions?  Can you control access at the page level, section level, or even individual element level?  Can you differentiate between read, write, and delete permissions?
    *   **Default Deny:**  The system *must* default to denying access unless explicitly granted.  This is a fundamental security principle.  The provided code snippet correctly implements this.
    *   **Path Normalization:**  The `path` variable must be properly normalized before being used in the authorization check.  Attackers might try to bypass authorization using techniques like:
        *   **Path Traversal:**  Using `../` sequences to access files outside the intended directory.
        *   **Double Encoding:**  Using `%252e%252e%252f` (which decodes to `../`) to bypass simple checks.
        *   **Case Sensitivity Issues:**  Exploiting differences in case sensitivity between the filesystem and the authorization logic.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Errors during the authorization check (e.g., database connection failure) should be handled gracefully and securely.  The system should *fail closed* (deny access) in case of errors.
    *   **Caching:**  Caching permission checks can improve performance, but it's crucial to ensure that the cache is invalidated when permissions change.  Stale cache entries could lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Integration with Gollum Actions:**  The middleware needs to consider not just page access but also other Gollum actions, such as creating, editing, deleting, renaming, and reverting pages.  Each action should have a corresponding authorization check.  The provided example only considers `PATH_INFO`, which might not be sufficient for all actions.  Gollum's internal API calls and hooks might need to be intercepted and checked as well.
* **Race Conditions:** If permission checks and resource access are not atomic, a race condition could occur. For example, if permissions are checked, then a short delay occurs before the resource is accessed, an attacker might be able to change the permissions during that delay.

### 2.2 Threat Mitigation Effectiveness

The strategy, *if implemented correctly*, effectively mitigates the following threats:

*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):**  By enforcing authorization checks on every request, the middleware prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying resources they shouldn't.  The effectiveness depends entirely on the robustness of the `user_has_permission?` implementation.
*   **Lack of Accountability (Medium Severity):**  By tying actions to authenticated and authorized users, the system can track who performed which actions.  This improves accountability and helps with auditing.

However, the strategy *does not* mitigate threats that are outside its scope, such as:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Authorization does not prevent XSS attacks, which can be used to steal session tokens or perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Authorization does not prevent CSRF attacks, which can trick a user into performing unintended actions.
*   **SQL Injection:**  If the permission storage mechanism (e.g., database) is vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could manipulate permissions or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Authorization does not prevent DoS attacks, which can overwhelm the server and make the wiki unavailable.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis

Several common authorization vulnerabilities could apply to this implementation:

*   **Broken Access Control:**  This is the overarching category for most authorization vulnerabilities.  It encompasses any flaw that allows a user to access resources or perform actions they shouldn't.  The specific vulnerabilities listed below are all forms of broken access control.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  As mentioned earlier, if user IDs or resource IDs are exposed and can be manipulated by an attacker, they could gain unauthorized access.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If a user can elevate their privileges (e.g., from "viewer" to "editor") without proper authorization, this is a privilege escalation vulnerability.  This could be due to flaws in the `user_has_permission?` logic or in the underlying authentication system.
*   **Missing Function Level Access Control:**  If the middleware only checks access to pages but not to specific actions (e.g., editing, deleting), an attacker could bypass authorization by directly calling the underlying functions.
*   **Path Traversal:** As mentioned before.

### 2.4 Best Practices Review

The proposed strategy aligns with some security best practices:

*   **Centralized Authorization:**  Using a middleware to centralize authorization logic is a good practice.  It makes it easier to manage and enforce consistent access control policies.
*   **Default Deny:**  The code snippet correctly implements the principle of default deny.
*   **Least Privilege:**  The strategy *should* be implemented to enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.

However, it also lacks explicit mention of some crucial best practices:

*   **Input Validation:**  The strategy doesn't explicitly mention validating user input (e.g., the `path` variable).  This is essential to prevent various attacks, including path traversal.
*   **Output Encoding:**  While not directly related to authorization, output encoding is crucial to prevent XSS attacks, which can be used to bypass authorization.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  The strategy doesn't mention the need for regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** The strategy should be developed and maintained as part of a secure development lifecycle, which includes threat modeling, secure coding practices, and security testing.

### 2.5 Implementation Considerations

Implementing this strategy in a real-world environment presents several challenges:

*   **Development Effort:**  Implementing a robust authorization system is a significant development effort.  It requires careful planning, design, and testing.
*   **Performance Overhead:**  Adding authorization checks to every request can introduce performance overhead.  This needs to be carefully considered and optimized.  Caching can help, but it needs to be implemented securely.
*   **Maintainability:**  The authorization logic needs to be maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.  A well-designed permission model and clear code are essential.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems:**  The authorization system needs to integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system and other components of the Gollum application.
*   **User Experience:**  The authorization system should be user-friendly and not overly restrictive.  It should provide clear error messages when access is denied.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Robust `get_user(env)`:** Implement `get_user` with extreme care, ensuring it's resistant to session fixation, IDOR, and other authentication bypass techniques.  Use a well-vetted authentication library or framework.
2.  **Secure `user_has_permission?`:**
    *   Choose a suitable permission storage mechanism (database recommended).
    *   Implement a well-defined permission model (RBAC recommended).
    *   Enforce default deny.
    *   Perform thorough path normalization.
    *   Handle errors securely (fail closed).
    *   Consider caching with secure invalidation.
3.  **Comprehensive Action Checks:**  Extend authorization checks to cover all Gollum actions, not just page access.
4.  **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input, especially the `path` variable.
5.  **Regular Audits and Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6.  **Atomic Operations:** Ensure that permission checks and resource access are performed atomically to prevent race conditions. Use database transactions where appropriate.
7.  **Consider using existing authorization libraries:** Instead of building everything from scratch, explore using existing, well-tested authorization libraries for Ruby (e.g., CanCanCan, Pundit). These libraries often provide a more structured and secure way to implement authorization logic.

## 4. Conclusion

The "Authorization (Custom Gollum Code/Middleware)" mitigation strategy is *essential* for securing a Gollum wiki.  However, its effectiveness depends entirely on the quality of its implementation.  The provided conceptual example highlights the core principles, but it's crucial to address the potential weaknesses and implementation considerations discussed in this analysis.  A poorly implemented authorization system can be worse than no authorization at all, as it can create a false sense of security.  By following the recommendations and adhering to security best practices, this strategy can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and improve the overall security posture of a Gollum-based wiki. The "Not Implemented" status is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed.
