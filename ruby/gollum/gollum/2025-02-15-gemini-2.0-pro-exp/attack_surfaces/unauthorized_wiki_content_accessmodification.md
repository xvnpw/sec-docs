## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Wiki Content Access/Modification in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Unauthorized Wiki Content Access/Modification" attack surface in a Gollum wiki application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing their exploitability, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview already provided.  The goal is to provide the development team with a clear understanding of the risks and the steps needed to secure the application effectively.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface related to unauthorized access and modification of wiki content within a Gollum application.  It considers:

*   **Gollum's core functionality:**  How Gollum's design and features contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Authentication mechanisms:**  The various authentication options available for Gollum and their strengths/weaknesses.
*   **Authorization mechanisms:** How to control access to specific pages or actions within Gollum.
*   **External factors:**  The role of reverse proxies and other infrastructure components in mitigating this risk.
*   **Git backend:** While Git provides an audit trail, this analysis focuses on *preventing* unauthorized access, not just detecting it after the fact.
* **Codebase analysis:** Analysis of potential vulnerabilities in codebase.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Attacks targeting the underlying Git repository directly (e.g., exploiting Git vulnerabilities).
*   Denial-of-service attacks against the Gollum application or its infrastructure.
*   Attacks targeting the web server or operating system (unless directly related to Gollum's configuration).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While a full code audit is outside the scope, we will conceptually review Gollum's code structure and relevant libraries (based on the GitHub repository) to identify potential areas of concern.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in Gollum and related components (e.g., authentication libraries).
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare the application's configuration and implementation against industry best practices for authentication, authorization, and web application security.
5.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** We will describe potential penetration testing techniques that could be used to exploit this attack surface.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1 Threat Modeling and Attack Scenarios:**

Here are some specific attack scenarios, building upon the general description:

*   **Scenario 1:  No Authentication:** If Gollum is deployed without *any* authentication, *anyone* can access and modify the wiki. This is the most critical and easily exploitable scenario.
*   **Scenario 2:  Weak HTTP Basic Authentication:**  If HTTP Basic Authentication is used with weak or default passwords, attackers can easily brute-force or guess credentials.
*   **Scenario 3:  Bypassing OmniAuth:**  If OmniAuth is misconfigured (e.g., using a development-mode client secret in production, or failing to validate the provider's response properly), an attacker might be able to forge authentication tokens.
*   **Scenario 4:  Insufficient Authorization:** Even with authentication, if all authenticated users have full write access, a compromised account (or a malicious insider) can cause significant damage.
*   **Scenario 5:  Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration:** If a reverse proxy is used for authentication but is misconfigured (e.g., allowing direct access to the Gollum application port), the authentication layer can be bypassed.
*   **Scenario 6:  Session Hijacking:** If session management is weak (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of HTTPS), an attacker could hijack a legitimate user's session and gain their privileges.
*   **Scenario 7:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While primarily a separate attack surface, XSS vulnerabilities in Gollum could be used to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user, leading to unauthorized content modification.
* **Scenario 8:  Path Traversal:** If Gollum is vulnerable to path traversal, an attacker might be able to access or modify files outside the intended wiki directory.
* **Scenario 9:  Git Command Injection:** If user input is not properly sanitized before being used in Git commands, an attacker might be able to inject arbitrary Git commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification.

**2.2 Code Review (Conceptual):**

Based on a review of the Gollum repository (https://github.com/gollum/gollum), the following areas are of particular concern regarding this attack surface:

*   **`lib/gollum/app.rb`:** This file handles the main Sinatra application logic, including routing and request handling.  It's crucial to ensure that all routes that allow modification of wiki content are properly protected by authentication and authorization checks.
*   **`lib/gollum/auth.rb`:** This file (if present, or any authentication-related modules) is critical.  It should be reviewed for proper implementation of the chosen authentication method (e.g., secure handling of passwords, secure integration with OmniAuth providers).
*   **`lib/gollum/wiki.rb` and `lib/gollum/page.rb`:** These files handle the core wiki and page logic.  They should be reviewed to ensure that all write operations (create, update, delete) are subject to proper authorization checks.
*   **`lib/gollum/frontend/views/*.erb`:** These ERB templates should be reviewed to ensure that they don't expose any sensitive information or introduce any XSS vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to bypass authentication.
* **Sanitization of user input:** All user input, especially in forms and URL parameters, must be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks (XSS, Git command injection, path traversal).

**2.3 Vulnerability Research:**

*   **CVE Search:** A search for "Gollum" on CVE databases (e.g., NIST NVD, MITRE CVE) should be performed regularly to identify any known vulnerabilities.
*   **GitHub Issues:** The Gollum GitHub repository's "Issues" section should be monitored for any reported security issues.
*   **Security Advisories:** Security advisories related to any libraries used by Gollum (e.g., Sinatra, OmniAuth, rugged) should be monitored.

**2.4 Best Practices Review:**

The following best practices are crucial for mitigating this attack surface:

*   **Mandatory Authentication:**  *Never* deploy Gollum without authentication in a production environment.
*   **Strong Authentication:**  Use a robust authentication method:
    *   **OmniAuth with a reputable provider (e.g., GitHub, Google, GitLab) is strongly recommended.** Ensure proper configuration and validation of provider responses.
    *   **HTTP Basic Authentication should only be used with strong, unique passwords and over HTTPS.** It's generally less secure than OmniAuth.
    *   **Consider integrating with an existing authentication system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory) if available.**
*   **Granular Authorization:** Implement page-level or section-level permissions whenever possible.  This limits the damage a compromised account can cause.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Secure Session Management:**
    *   **Use HTTPS for all communication.**
    *   **Generate strong, random session IDs.**
    *   **Set the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on session cookies.**
    *   **Implement session timeouts.**
*   **Reverse Proxy:**  Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) for:
    *   **Additional authentication/authorization layers (e.g., 2FA, IP whitelisting).**
    *   **SSL termination.**
    *   **Request filtering and rate limiting.**
    *   **Centralized logging and monitoring.**
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep Gollum and all its dependencies up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

**2.5 Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**

The following penetration testing techniques could be used to attempt to exploit this attack surface:

*   **Attempt to access and modify wiki pages without authentication.**
*   **Attempt to brute-force or guess HTTP Basic Authentication credentials.**
*   **Attempt to forge OmniAuth tokens or bypass the OmniAuth flow.**
*   **Attempt to hijack user sessions.**
*   **Attempt to inject malicious content (XSS) to steal session cookies or perform unauthorized actions.**
*   **Attempt path traversal attacks to access files outside the wiki directory.**
*   **Attempt Git command injection attacks.**
*   **Test for insufficient authorization by creating a low-privilege account and attempting to modify restricted pages.**

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Building on the initial mitigation strategies, here are more detailed and actionable recommendations:

1.  **Strong Authentication (Prioritized):**

    *   **OmniAuth Implementation:**
        *   **Choose a reputable provider:** GitHub, Google, GitLab, or a trusted enterprise identity provider.
        *   **Use the latest version of the OmniAuth gem and the provider-specific gem.**
        *   **Store client secrets securely:**  Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system. *Never* commit secrets to the code repository.
        *   **Validate provider responses:**  Ensure that the response from the authentication provider is valid and contains the expected information.  Check for errors and handle them appropriately.
        *   **Implement proper session management:**  Use secure, random session IDs, set the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on cookies, and implement session timeouts.
    *   **HTTP Basic Authentication (Less Preferred):**
        *   **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require a minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular password changes.
        *   **Use a password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to store passwords securely.** *Never* store passwords in plain text.
        *   **Use HTTPS for all communication.**
        *   **Consider implementing rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.**
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Strongly consider implementing 2FA, ideally through the reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) or through the chosen OmniAuth provider (if supported).

2.  **Granular Authorization:**

    *   **Leverage Gollum's Hooks (if possible):** Explore Gollum's hook system to implement custom authorization logic.  Hooks can be used to intercept page creation, modification, and deletion events and enforce custom access control rules.
    *   **Custom Middleware:**  If hooks are insufficient, consider writing custom Sinatra middleware to implement authorization checks.  This middleware could check the user's identity and permissions against a database or configuration file before allowing access to specific routes.
    *   **Page-Level Permissions:**  Ideally, implement a system where each page (or a group of pages) has associated permissions (e.g., read, write, admin).  This could be stored in a separate database table or in the page metadata (if supported by Gollum).

3.  **Reverse Proxy Configuration:**

    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Configure the reverse proxy to handle authentication and authorization *before* requests reach Gollum.  This adds a layer of defense and allows for more advanced features (e.g., 2FA, IP whitelisting).
    *   **SSL Termination:**  Configure the reverse proxy to handle SSL termination, ensuring that all communication between the client and the server is encrypted.
    *   **Request Filtering:**  Use the reverse proxy to filter out malicious requests (e.g., requests containing suspicious characters or patterns).
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Block Direct Access:** Configure the reverse proxy to *block* direct access to the Gollum application port.  All requests should go through the reverse proxy.

4.  **Regular Audits and Monitoring:**

    *   **User Account Review:** Regularly review user accounts and permissions to ensure that they are still appropriate.  Remove or disable inactive accounts.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor Gollum's logs (and the reverse proxy's logs) for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, and unusual page modifications.
    *   **Automated Alerts:**  Set up automated alerts to notify administrators of any security-related events.

5. **Code Hardening:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization using a dedicated library or framework.  This should include:
        *   **HTML escaping:**  Escape all HTML tags and special characters to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   **Path sanitization:**  Prevent path traversal attacks by validating and sanitizing file paths.
        *   **Git command sanitization:**  Prevent Git command injection by carefully validating and escaping any user input that is used in Git commands.
    * **Regular expression validation:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of user input, such as email addresses, usernames, and URLs.

6. **Dependency Management:**
    * **Automated Updates:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Bundler) to keep Gollum and all its dependencies up to date.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., bundler-audit, Snyk) to automatically identify any known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.

### 4. Conclusion
