Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Information Disclosure (.git directory)" attack surface for a Gollum-based application, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis: Information Disclosure (.git Directory) in Gollum

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with the exposure of the `.git` directory in a Gollum wiki deployment, to identify specific vulnerabilities beyond the general description, and to propose comprehensive mitigation strategies that go beyond basic web server configuration.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers and system administrators.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `.git` directory exposure vulnerability.  It encompasses:

*   **Gollum's interaction with Git:** How Gollum's reliance on Git contributes to the vulnerability.
*   **Web server configurations:**  Common misconfigurations that lead to exposure.
*   **Types of information leaked:**  A detailed breakdown of the sensitive data potentially exposed.
*   **Exploitation techniques:**  How attackers can leverage this exposure.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**  Both basic and advanced techniques to prevent and detect exposure.
*   **Impact on different deployment scenarios:** Considering various deployment methods (e.g., bare metal, Docker, cloud).

This analysis *does not* cover other potential attack vectors against Gollum (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly relate to the `.git` directory exposure.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Examine existing documentation on Git, Gollum, web server security, and known `.git` directory exposure vulnerabilities.
2.  **Practical Experimentation:**  Set up a test Gollum instance and deliberately misconfigure the web server to replicate the vulnerability.  Attempt to access and extract information from the exposed `.git` directory.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attack scenarios and the steps an attacker might take to exploit the vulnerability.
4.  **Code Review (Limited):**  Examine relevant parts of the Gollum codebase (if necessary) to understand how it interacts with Git, but the primary focus is on the *deployment* aspect, not Gollum's internal Git handling.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose a layered defense approach, including preventative and detective controls.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Gollum's Git Dependency and the Vulnerability

Gollum's core functionality relies on Git for version control.  Every page edit, creation, and deletion results in a Git commit.  This tight integration means that a `.git` directory *must* exist within the wiki's root directory.  The vulnerability isn't the *presence* of the `.git` directory, but its *accessibility* via the web server.  Gollum itself doesn't directly expose the directory; the web server's configuration (or misconfiguration) is the culprit.

### 2.2. Web Server Misconfigurations

Several common web server misconfigurations can lead to `.git` directory exposure:

*   **Default Configurations:**  Some web server default configurations might not explicitly deny access to hidden directories (those starting with a dot).
*   **Incorrect `AllowOverride` Settings (Apache):**  If `.htaccess` files are enabled (`AllowOverride All` or a permissive setting) and a misconfigured or missing `.htaccess` file exists in the wiki root, the `.git` directory might be exposed.
*   **Virtual Host Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured virtual hosts might inadvertently serve the `.git` directory.  For example, a misconfigured `DocumentRoot` or `Alias` directive.
*   **Reverse Proxy Issues:**  If a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) is used in front of the application server (e.g., Puma, Unicorn), the reverse proxy might not be configured to block access to the `.git` directory.
*   **Symlink Vulnerabilities:** If symlinks are allowed, and a symlink is created that points to the .git directory, it could be exposed.

### 2.3. Types of Information Leaked

The `.git` directory contains a wealth of information about the repository's history and structure.  Exposure can leak:

*   **Source Code (if applicable):** If the Gollum wiki includes code snippets or scripts, the entire history of those files is exposed.
*   **Page Content History:**  All previous versions of every wiki page, including potentially sensitive information that was later removed or redacted. This is a major privacy and security concern.
*   **Commit Messages:**  Commit messages might contain sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or internal discussions.
*   **Author Information:**  The names and email addresses of contributors.
*   **Repository Structure:**  The internal structure of the Git repository, which can aid in further attacks.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Potentially sensitive configuration files stored within the wiki.
*   **Object Database:**  The raw Git objects (blobs, trees, commits) can be downloaded and analyzed.  Tools like `git cat-file` can be used to reconstruct files and history.
*   **Refs:** Information about branches and tags, revealing the development workflow.
*   **Hooks:**  Potentially revealing custom scripts used in the repository.

### 2.4. Exploitation Techniques

An attacker can exploit an exposed `.git` directory in several ways:

1.  **Direct Access:**  Simply browsing to `http://example.com/wiki/.git/` and navigating the directory structure.
2.  **Automated Tools:**  Using tools like `git-dumper` (from the `GitTools` suite) or `GitHack` to automatically download the entire `.git` directory. These tools efficiently retrieve all objects and reconstruct the repository locally.
3.  **Incremental Downloading:**  Manually downloading specific files (e.g., `config`, `HEAD`, `logs/HEAD`, `objects/info/packs`) to gather information and then strategically downloading other objects based on that information.
4.  **Reconstructing the Repository:**  Using `git clone --bare` with the URL of the exposed `.git` directory to create a local bare clone.  This provides a complete copy of the repository's history.
5.  **Analyzing the History:**  Using standard Git commands (e.g., `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`) on the cloned repository to examine the history, identify sensitive information, and understand the evolution of the wiki.
6. **Using exposed information for further attacks:** Using leaked credentials, API keys, or knowledge of the system's architecture to launch further attacks.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

A layered approach is crucial for mitigating this vulnerability:

*   **2.5.1. Primary Prevention (Web Server Configuration):**

    *   **Apache:**
        ```apache
        <DirectoryMatch "/\.git">
            Require all denied
        </DirectoryMatch>
        ```
        This is the *most important* mitigation.  Place this directive in the main server configuration (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `apache2.conf`) or within a `<VirtualHost>` block.  Avoid relying solely on `.htaccess` files.

    *   **Nginx:**
        ```nginx
        location ~ /\.git {
            deny all;
        }
        ```
        Place this within the `server` block of your Nginx configuration.

    *   **Other Web Servers:**  Consult the documentation for your specific web server to find the equivalent directive for denying access to a directory.

*   **2.5.2. Secondary Prevention (Application Level):**

    *   **Gollum Configuration (Limited Impact):** While Gollum doesn't directly control web server access, ensure that any configuration options related to file serving are reviewed.  This is less relevant for this specific vulnerability, but good practice.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Configure a WAF (e.g., ModSecurity, AWS WAF) to block requests containing `/.git/`.  This provides an additional layer of defense.

*   **2.5.3. Detection and Monitoring:**

    *   **Web Server Logs:**  Regularly monitor web server access logs for requests to `/.git/`.  Automated log analysis tools can help identify suspicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Configure an IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to detect and alert on attempts to access the `.git` directory.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool (e.g., OSSEC, Tripwire) to monitor the integrity of the web server configuration files and the wiki directory.  This can help detect unauthorized changes that might expose the `.git` directory.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
    * **Automated Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners that specifically check for exposed `.git` directories.

*   **2.5.4. Deployment Considerations:**

    *   **Docker:**  Ensure that the Docker image used for Gollum is properly configured and doesn't expose the `.git` directory.  Use a multi-stage build to minimize the attack surface.  The web server configuration *within* the container must be secure.
    *   **Cloud Deployments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP):**  Utilize cloud-specific security features, such as security groups, network ACLs, and WAFs, to restrict access to the `.git` directory.  Ensure that the web server running within the cloud instance is correctly configured.
    *   **Bare Metal:**  Follow the web server configuration guidelines (Apache, Nginx) meticulously.

*   **2.5.5 Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure that the user running the web server process has the minimum necessary permissions. It should not have write access to the .git directory unless absolutely necessary.

### 2.6. Impact on Different Deployment Scenarios

*   **Bare Metal:**  Directly susceptible if the web server is misconfigured.  Mitigation relies heavily on correct web server configuration.
*   **Docker:**  The vulnerability exists *within* the container.  If the container's web server is misconfigured, the `.git` directory is exposed *within the container's network*.  Port mapping and network configuration determine external exposure.
*   **Cloud:**  Similar to bare metal, but cloud platforms offer additional security layers (security groups, WAFs) that can be leveraged.

## 3. Conclusion

The exposure of the `.git` directory in a Gollum deployment is a high-severity vulnerability that can lead to significant information disclosure.  While Gollum's reliance on Git necessitates the existence of the `.git` directory, the vulnerability stems from web server misconfiguration.  A multi-layered approach, combining proper web server configuration, application-level security measures, and robust monitoring, is essential to mitigate this risk effectively.  Regular security audits and proactive vulnerability scanning are crucial for maintaining a secure Gollum deployment. The most important and effective mitigation is the correct configuration of the web server to deny access to the `.git` directory. All other mitigations are secondary to this.
