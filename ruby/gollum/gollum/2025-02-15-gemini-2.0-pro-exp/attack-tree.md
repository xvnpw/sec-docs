## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. SQL Injection (if database-backed) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__sql_injection__if_database-backed___hr_.md)

*   **1.1.1. Bypass input validation:** The attacker crafts malicious input that bypasses any existing input validation checks, allowing them to inject SQL code. This could involve using unexpected characters, encoding techniques, or exploiting flaws in the validation logic.
*   **1.1.2. Exploit vulnerable query [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker injects SQL code into a vulnerable input field that is used to construct a database query. This allows the attacker to modify the query's logic, potentially retrieving, modifying, or deleting data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__cross-site_scripting__xss___hr_.md)

*   **1.2.1. Stored XSS (via page content) [CRITICAL]:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a wiki page (e.g., through a comment, edit, or file upload). This code is then stored on the server and executed in the browsers of other users who view the page, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the site, or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Path Traversal [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__path_traversal__hr_.md)

*   **1.3.1. Manipulate file paths in requests:** The attacker crafts a URL or input that includes characters like "../" to navigate outside the intended directory and access files elsewhere on the server.
*   **1.3.2. Access sensitive files (e.g., configuration) [CRITICAL]:** By successfully traversing the file system, the attacker gains access to files containing sensitive information, such as configuration files with database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__authentication_bypass__critical_.md)

*   **1.4.2. Brute-force weak passwords:** The attacker uses automated tools to try many different username/password combinations, hoping to guess a valid one.  This is particularly effective if users have weak or easily guessable passwords.
*   **1.4.3. Session hijacking (if session management is flawed):** The attacker steals a valid user's session ID (e.g., through XSS or network sniffing) and uses it to impersonate that user, gaining access to their account without needing the password.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5. Authorization Bypass [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5__authorization_bypass__hr_.md)

*   **1.5.2. Bypass restrictions on editing/deleting pages [CRITICAL]:** The attacker exploits a flaw in the authorization logic to gain access to pages or features they should not have access to, allowing them to modify or delete content without proper permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.6. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_6__remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

*   **1.6.1. Exploit vulnerability in parsing user input (e.g., Markdown, file uploads):** The attacker crafts malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in the way the server processes user-supplied data (e.g., Markdown rendering, image processing, file uploads). This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **1.6.2. Leverage vulnerable dependencies:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party library or component used by Gollum to gain code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Weak or Default Credentials [HR] - [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__weak_or_default_credentials__hr__-__critical_.md)

*   **2.1.1. Gain access using default/weak credentials:** The attacker uses default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin") or easily guessable passwords to gain access to the Gollum administration interface or other sensitive areas.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Exposed Sensitive Files/Directories (.git, backups, etc.) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__exposed_sensitive_filesdirectories___git__backups__etc____hr_.md)

*   **2.2.1. Access .git directory to retrieve source code and history [CRITICAL]:** The attacker accesses the `.git` directory, which contains the entire version history of the wiki, including potentially sensitive information that has been removed from the current version.
*   **2.2.2 Access backup files to retrieve old versions of pages:** The attacker finds and accesses backup files, which may contain sensitive information that has been removed from the live wiki.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Insecure File Uploads [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__insecure_file_uploads__hr_.md)

*   **2.3.1. Upload malicious file (e.g., shell script) [CRITICAL]:** The attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., a PHP script, a shell script) that can be executed on the server.
*   **2.3.2. Bypass file type restrictions:** The attacker bypasses file type restrictions (e.g., by using double extensions or manipulating the MIME type) to upload a malicious file.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.5. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_5__insufficient_logging_and_monitoring__hr_.md)

*   **2.5.1. Delayed or missed detection of attacks:**  Lack of proper logging and monitoring allows attacks to go unnoticed, giving the attacker more time to exploit vulnerabilities and cause damage.  This is a vulnerability in itself, as it hinders incident response.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Phishing Attacks Targeting Administrators [HR] - [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__phishing_attacks_targeting_administrators__hr__-__critical_.md)

*   **3.1.1. Obtain administrator credentials:** The attacker sends a phishing email to an administrator, tricking them into revealing their username and password or clicking on a malicious link that compromises their account.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Tricking Users into Uploading Malicious Files [HR] - [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__tricking_users_into_uploading_malicious_files__hr__-__critical_.md)

*   **3.2.1. User uploads malicious file disguised as legitimate content:** The attacker convinces a user to upload a malicious file (e.g., a document containing a macro virus or a disguised executable) to the wiki. This file can then be used to compromise other users or the server itself.
