Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Gollum (the wiki engine) and its potential vulnerabilities.

## Deep Analysis of Gollum Attack Tree Path: 3.2.1 - Malicious File Upload

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path where a user is tricked into uploading a malicious file to a Gollum wiki, disguised as legitimate content.  We aim to identify:

*   Specific vulnerabilities within Gollum and its typical deployment configurations that could facilitate this attack.
*   The potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Effective mitigation strategies to reduce the risk and impact.
*   Detection methods to identify attempts or successful executions of this attack.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Gollum Wiki Engine:**  We'll examine Gollum's file upload mechanisms, supported file types, and any built-in security features related to file uploads.  We'll consider the default configurations and common customizations.
*   **User Interaction:**  We'll analyze how users are typically persuaded to upload files and how attackers might exploit those interactions.  This includes social engineering aspects.
*   **Server-Side Impact:**  We'll consider the potential consequences of a malicious file being uploaded and potentially executed or accessed on the server hosting the Gollum wiki.
*   **Client-Side Impact:** We'll consider the potential consequences of a malicious file being downloaded and executed or opened by other users of the wiki.
*   **Common Dependencies:** We'll consider the security implications of common dependencies used by Gollum, such as Git (for version control) and the underlying web server (e.g., Puma, Thin, or a reverse proxy like Nginx/Apache).
* **Authentication and Authorization:** We will consider how authentication and authorization mechanisms can prevent or allow this attack.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Attacks that do not involve file uploads (e.g., XSS attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the wiki markup rendering, unless directly related to the uploaded file).
*   General network security issues unrelated to Gollum (e.g., DDoS attacks on the server).
*   Physical security of the server.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We'll examine the Gollum source code (available on GitHub) to understand how file uploads are handled.  We'll look for:
    *   File type validation logic.
    *   File name sanitization.
    *   Storage mechanisms (where and how files are saved).
    *   Any use of external libraries for file processing (e.g., image libraries).
    *   Any relevant security-related configurations.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We'll set up a test instance of Gollum and attempt to upload various types of files, including:
    *   Known malicious file types (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.sh`, files with embedded macros).
    *   Files with unusual or potentially dangerous extensions.
    *   Files with manipulated MIME types.
    *   Very large files (to test for denial-of-service vulnerabilities).
    *   Files with names designed to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).

3.  **Dependency Analysis:** We'll review the security advisories and known vulnerabilities of Gollum's dependencies, particularly those related to file handling.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We'll consider various attacker scenarios and how they might leverage social engineering to trick users into uploading malicious files.

5.  **Mitigation and Detection Analysis:**  Based on the findings, we'll propose specific mitigation strategies and detection methods.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.2.1

**4.1. Vulnerability Analysis (Code Review & Dynamic Analysis)**

*   **File Type Validation:** Gollum, by default, does *not* perform strict file type validation based on content.  It primarily relies on file extensions.  This is a significant vulnerability.  A file named `report.pdf` could contain a PowerShell script, and Gollum would likely accept it.  The `gollum-lib` gem, which Gollum uses, provides some basic MIME type detection, but it's easily bypassed by manipulating the file's reported MIME type.

*   **File Name Sanitization:** Gollum does perform some sanitization of filenames to prevent basic path traversal attacks.  It replaces potentially dangerous characters.  However, the effectiveness of this sanitization needs to be continuously reviewed and tested, as new bypass techniques are often discovered.  It's crucial to ensure that filenames cannot be used to overwrite existing files or access files outside the intended wiki directory.

*   **Storage Mechanism:** Gollum stores uploaded files within the Git repository that backs the wiki.  This means that the files are versioned, which is good for recovery, but it also means that malicious files, once uploaded, remain in the history unless explicitly removed (which requires Git expertise).  The files are stored in a designated uploads directory (configurable).

*   **Execution Prevention:** Gollum itself does not directly execute uploaded files.  However, the web server serving the wiki *might*.  If the web server is misconfigured, it could execute files within the uploads directory.  For example, if the uploads directory is within the web server's document root and the server is configured to execute `.php` files, an attacker could upload a `malicious.php` file and then execute it by accessing it directly via a URL.  This is a *critical* configuration issue.

*   **Client-Side Risks:**  The primary risk is that other users will download and open the malicious file.  If the file is a disguised executable or a document with a malicious macro, the user's system could be compromised.  Gollum doesn't provide any client-side protection against this.

* **Authentication and Authorization:** If the wiki is public and allows anonymous uploads, this attack is trivial.  Even with authentication, if any authenticated user can upload files, the attack is still possible.  Proper authorization, limiting upload privileges to trusted users, is crucial.

**4.2. Threat Modeling (Social Engineering)**

Attackers might use various social engineering techniques to trick users:

*   **Phishing Emails:**  An email pretending to be from a colleague or a trusted source, requesting the user to upload a "critical document" to the wiki.
*   **Fake Wiki Pages:**  An attacker might create a fake wiki page (if they have write access) that mimics a legitimate upload form or provides instructions to upload a file.
*   **Urgency and Authority:**  The attacker might use language that creates a sense of urgency or appeals to authority to pressure the user into uploading the file without careful consideration.
*   **Deceptive File Names and Descriptions:**  The attacker will use file names and descriptions that make the malicious file appear legitimate (e.g., "Quarterly Report.docx," "Security Update.pdf").

**4.3. Impact Analysis**

The impact of a successful attack can range from minor to severe:

*   **Server Compromise:**  If the attacker can execute code on the server (e.g., through a misconfigured web server), they could gain full control of the server, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying the wiki content, or using the server to launch further attacks.
*   **Client Compromise:**  If other users download and open the malicious file, their systems could be compromised, leading to data theft, malware infection, or further propagation of the attack.
*   **Data Loss/Corruption:**  The attacker could potentially delete or modify wiki content.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the organization using the wiki.
*   **Denial of Service:** While less likely with this specific attack path, a very large or specially crafted file *could* potentially cause a denial-of-service condition.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies**

*   **Strict File Type Validation (Whitelist):**  Implement *strict* file type validation based on file *content*, not just extensions.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific, known-safe file types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.txt`).  Do *not* rely on MIME types alone, as these are easily spoofed.  Consider using a library like `file` (the command-line utility) or a robust programming language equivalent to determine the true file type.

*   **File Content Scanning (Antivirus/Antimalware):**  Integrate an antivirus/antimalware scanner to scan all uploaded files *before* they are stored in the repository.  This can detect known malware signatures.  This should be a server-side process.

*   **Sandboxing:**  Consider processing uploaded files in a sandboxed environment.  This is particularly important for potentially dangerous file types like documents with macros.  The sandbox can prevent the file from accessing sensitive system resources.

*   **Web Server Configuration:**  Ensure that the web server is configured *not* to execute files in the uploads directory.  This is a critical security measure.  Use a separate directory for uploads that is *outside* the web server's document root, and serve the files through a dedicated Gollum route that performs appropriate checks.

*   **User Education:**  Train users to be suspicious of unsolicited file uploads and to verify the authenticity of requests before uploading files.  Educate them about social engineering techniques.

*   **Least Privilege:**  Restrict upload privileges to only those users who absolutely need them.  Implement a strong authorization model.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Gollum installation and its configuration, including penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks that might be used in conjunction with malicious file uploads.

*   **Git Hooks:** Consider using Git pre-receive hooks to perform additional checks on uploaded files before they are committed to the repository. This can provide an extra layer of defense.

**4.5. Detection Methods**

*   **File Upload Monitoring:**  Log all file upload attempts, including the username, filename, file size, and timestamp.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as uploads of unusual file types or large numbers of uploads from a single user.

*   **Antivirus/Antimalware Alerts:**  Configure the antivirus/antimalware scanner to generate alerts when it detects malicious files.

*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to file uploads.

*   **Web Server Logs:**  Regularly review web server logs for unusual requests to the uploads directory, especially requests that attempt to execute files.

*   **Git History Monitoring:**  Periodically review the Git history for suspicious file additions or modifications.

* **Honeypot Files:** Place decoy files in the upload directory. Any access or modification to these files should trigger an immediate alert.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path of tricking users into uploading malicious files to a Gollum wiki is a serious threat.  Gollum's default configuration does not provide sufficient protection against this attack.  However, by implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, the risk can be significantly reduced.  A combination of technical controls (strict file type validation, antivirus scanning, secure web server configuration) and user education is essential to protect against this vulnerability.  Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are crucial for maintaining a secure Gollum installation.
