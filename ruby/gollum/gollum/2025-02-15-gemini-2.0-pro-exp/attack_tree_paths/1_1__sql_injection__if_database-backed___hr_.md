Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Gollum's potential vulnerabilities to SQL Injection.

## Deep Analysis of Gollum SQL Injection Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities within the Gollum wiki application, specifically focusing on the attack path outlined (1.1 and its sub-nodes).  We aim to identify specific code locations, configurations, or usage patterns that could lead to successful exploitation, and to propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to enhance Gollum's security posture against this common and dangerous attack vector.

**Scope:**

This analysis will focus exclusively on the following:

*   **Gollum's core codebase:**  We will examine the Ruby code within the `gollum/gollum` repository, paying close attention to how user input is handled and incorporated into database queries.  We will *not* analyze the security of underlying database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) themselves, assuming they are properly configured and patched.  We *will*, however, consider how Gollum interacts with these systems.
*   **Database-backed configurations:**  The analysis explicitly targets Gollum installations that utilize a database backend.  File-based (Git-only) installations are *out of scope* for this specific analysis, as they are not directly susceptible to SQL injection.
*   **The specified attack path:** We will concentrate on the two-step process: bypassing input validation (1.1.1) and exploiting a vulnerable query (1.1.2).  Other potential attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF) are outside the scope of this particular analysis.
*   **Supported database adapters:** We will consider the officially supported database adapters used by Gollum, primarily through the `gollum-lib` and potentially through direct interactions.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**  We will manually review the Gollum source code, focusing on:
    *   Identification of database interaction points (e.g., using libraries like `Sequel`, `ActiveRecord`, or direct database calls).
    *   Tracing user input from its entry point (e.g., web forms, API calls) to its use in database queries.
    *   Examination of input validation and sanitization routines.
    *   Analysis of how database queries are constructed (e.g., string concatenation vs. parameterized queries).
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While a full dynamic analysis with live testing is beyond the scope of this document, we will *conceptually* describe how dynamic testing could be used to confirm vulnerabilities and test mitigations. This includes:
    *   Crafting malicious SQL injection payloads.
    *   Observing application behavior and database responses.
3.  **Review of Existing Documentation and Issues:** We will consult Gollum's official documentation, issue tracker, and any relevant security advisories to identify known vulnerabilities or best practices.
4.  **Vulnerability Pattern Matching:** We will look for common SQL injection vulnerability patterns, such as:
    *   Direct use of user input in SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.
    *   Insufficient or flawed input validation routines.
    *   Use of outdated or vulnerable database libraries.
5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles and their potential motivations for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in Gollum.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**1.1. SQL Injection (if database-backed) [HR]**

This is the root of our analysis.  Gollum, by default, uses Git for storage, making it inherently resistant to SQL injection in its *default* configuration. However, Gollum *can* be configured to use a database backend for storing page content and metadata. This configuration introduces the potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**1.1.1. Bypass input validation:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability Locations:**
    *   **Search Functionality:**  If the search feature uses a database backend, the search input field is a prime target.  Attackers might try to inject SQL code here.  We need to examine how Gollum constructs the search query.
    *   **Page Editing (Indirectly):** While page content itself might be stored in Git, metadata (e.g., page title, author, timestamps) *could* be stored in the database.  Input fields related to this metadata are potential targets.
    *   **Custom Fields/Extensions:** If Gollum supports custom fields or extensions that interact with the database, these could introduce new input vectors.
    *   **API Endpoints:** If Gollum exposes API endpoints that interact with the database, these endpoints need careful scrutiny.
    *   **File Uploads (Indirectly):** If file metadata (filename, upload date) is stored in the database, this could be a vector.

*   **Bypass Techniques:**
    *   **Character Encoding:** Attackers might use URL encoding, Unicode encoding, or other character encoding schemes to bypass simple string-based validation checks.  For example, a single quote (`'`) might be encoded as `%27`.
    *   **Comment Sequences:**  SQL comments (`--` or `/* ... */`) can be used to comment out parts of the intended query, allowing the attacker to inject their own code.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the validation logic itself could be exploited.  For example, if the validation only checks for the presence of certain characters but doesn't consider their order or context, it might be bypassed.
    *   **Type Juggling:** If Gollum (or its underlying libraries) performs loose type comparisons, attackers might be able to inject unexpected data types that bypass validation.
    *   **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  This occurs when injected data is stored in the database and later used in another query without proper sanitization.  This is less likely in Gollum's core functionality but could be a concern with custom extensions.

*   **Mitigation Strategies (Input Validation):**
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Instead of trying to block malicious characters (blacklist), define a strict set of *allowed* characters and reject anything that doesn't match. This is generally more robust than blacklisting.
    *   **Input Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on all input fields to prevent excessively long injection attempts.
    *   **Regular Expressions (Carefully):**  Regular expressions can be used for validation, but they must be carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities and to ensure they correctly match the intended input format.
    *   **Type Enforcement:**  Ensure that input is of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date) before using it in a query.
    *   **Context-Aware Validation:**  The validation rules should be appropriate for the context in which the input is used.  For example, a page title might have different validation rules than a search query.
    *   **Input Encoding:** Before displaying any user-provided data, encode it appropriately for the output context (e.g., HTML encoding to prevent XSS, which could be a secondary consequence of a successful SQL injection).

**1.1.2. Exploit vulnerable query [CRITICAL]:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability Locations:**
    *   Any code that constructs SQL queries using user-provided input without proper parameterization or escaping.  This is the *critical* point of failure.
    *   Look for string concatenation or interpolation used to build SQL queries.  For example, in Ruby:
        ```ruby
        # VULNERABLE:
        query = "SELECT * FROM pages WHERE title = '#{user_input}'"
        db.execute(query)

        # SAFE (using parameterized query):
        query = "SELECT * FROM pages WHERE title = ?"
        db.execute(query, user_input)
        ```

*   **Exploitation Techniques:**
    *   **UNION-based Injection:**  The attacker uses the `UNION` operator to combine the results of the original query with the results of their own injected query. This can be used to extract data from other tables.
    *   **Error-based Injection:**  The attacker crafts input that causes a database error, and the error message reveals information about the database structure or data.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The attacker doesn't see the results of their injected query directly, but they can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., timing differences, changes in HTTP responses).
    *   **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:**  The attacker uses SQL functions like `SLEEP()` to introduce delays, allowing them to infer information bit by bit.
    *   **Out-of-band Injection:**  The attacker uses SQL functions to trigger external actions (e.g., sending an HTTP request to a server they control), allowing them to exfiltrate data.
    *   **Stacked Queries:**  Some database systems allow multiple SQL statements to be executed in a single query (separated by semicolons).  Attackers can use this to execute arbitrary commands.

*   **Mitigation Strategies (Query Construction):**
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the attacker from injecting malicious code.  The database driver handles escaping and quoting automatically.  This is the *gold standard* for preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) (with Caution):**  ORMs like Sequel or ActiveRecord can help prevent SQL injection *if used correctly*.  However, it's still possible to write vulnerable code even with an ORM if you bypass its built-in protection mechanisms (e.g., by using raw SQL queries).  Always use the ORM's query building methods rather than constructing SQL strings directly.
    *   **Stored Procedures (with Caution):**  Stored procedures can help, but they are not a silver bullet.  If the stored procedure itself constructs SQL queries dynamically using user input, it can still be vulnerable.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  The database user account used by Gollum should have the *minimum necessary privileges*.  It should not have permission to create or drop tables, modify database users, or access data outside of the Gollum wiki.
    *   **Database Firewall:**  A database firewall can be used to monitor and block suspicious SQL queries.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular code reviews and penetration testing are essential to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### 3. Gollum-Specific Considerations

*   **Gollum's Database Adapters:**  We need to investigate how Gollum interacts with different database systems.  Does it use a common abstraction layer (like `gollum-lib`)?  Are there specific adapters for different databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)?  The security of these adapters is crucial.
*   **`gollum-lib`:** This library likely handles the database interactions.  We need to examine its code for any potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Community Contributions:**  Gollum is an open-source project, so community contributions could introduce vulnerabilities.  Code review processes should be in place to catch these.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Are there any configuration options related to database security that users should be aware of?  For example, are there options to enable parameterized queries or to specify the database user account?

### 4. Conclusion and Recommendations

SQL Injection is a serious threat to any application that uses a database.  While Gollum's default Git-based storage mitigates this risk, database-backed installations are vulnerable.  The most effective mitigation is the consistent use of **parameterized queries** for all database interactions.  Input validation is also important, but it should be considered a secondary defense.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and penetration testing are essential to ensure the ongoing security of Gollum.

**Specific Recommendations for the Gollum Development Team:**

1.  **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  Conduct a thorough code review to ensure that *all* database queries use parameterized queries or a safe ORM abstraction.  Any instances of string concatenation or interpolation used to build SQL queries should be refactored.
2.  **Strengthen Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation using whitelisting, length limits, and type enforcement.  Ensure that validation is context-aware and appropriate for the specific input field.
3.  **Review Database Adapters:**  Carefully examine the code in `gollum-lib` and any other database adapters to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Document Security Best Practices:**  Provide clear documentation for users on how to securely configure Gollum, especially when using a database backend.  This should include recommendations on database user privileges and the importance of parameterized queries.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
6.  **Consider a Security Bounty Program:**  A security bounty program can incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
7. **Automated Security Scanning:** Integrate automated static and dynamic analysis tools into the development pipeline to catch potential vulnerabilities early.

By implementing these recommendations, the Gollum development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of the application.
