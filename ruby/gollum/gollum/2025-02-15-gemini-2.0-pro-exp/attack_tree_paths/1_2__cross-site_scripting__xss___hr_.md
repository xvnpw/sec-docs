Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Stored XSS vulnerabilities within the Gollum wiki application.

## Deep Analysis of Gollum Stored XSS Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability can be exploited in Gollum (specifically via page content), assess the potential impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to identify specific code paths and configurations that contribute to this vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  Stored XSS attacks achieved by injecting malicious scripts into wiki page content.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Direct edits to page content.
    *   Comments (if enabled).
    *   File uploads that are rendered as part of the page (e.g., SVG images, HTML snippets if allowed).
    *   Any other mechanism that allows user-supplied data to be persistently stored and later rendered as part of a wiki page.
*   **Target Application:** Gollum wiki software (https://github.com/gollum/gollum). We will consider the latest stable release and any known relevant historical vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  We will analyze the potential impact on users and the system, including session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and potential escalation of privileges.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Reflected XSS or DOM-based XSS.
    *   Vulnerabilities outside the scope of page content manipulation.
    *   Vulnerabilities in underlying libraries *unless* Gollum's usage of those libraries directly contributes to the Stored XSS vulnerability.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Gollum source code (primarily Ruby and JavaScript) to identify:
    *   Input validation and sanitization routines (or lack thereof) related to page content creation and editing.
    *   How user-supplied data is stored and retrieved from the database or file system.
    *   How page content is rendered in the browser, paying close attention to areas where user input is incorporated into the HTML.
    *   The use of any templating engines and how they handle escaping.
    *   Configuration options that might affect XSS vulnerability (e.g., enabling/disabling certain markup formats).

2.  **Vulnerability Database Research:** We will consult vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD, Snyk) and security advisories to identify any previously reported Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Gollum.  This will provide context and potentially highlight specific areas of concern.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will perform targeted penetration testing on a locally deployed instance of Gollum. This will involve:
    *   Crafting malicious payloads designed to exploit potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Attempting to inject these payloads through various input vectors (page edits, comments, etc.).
    *   Observing the behavior of the application and the browser to determine if the payloads are executed.
    *   Testing different configurations and markup formats.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider the attacker's perspective, identifying potential motivations and resources. This will help us prioritize mitigation efforts.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1. Stored XSS (via page content)

**2.1. Potential Vulnerability Points (Code Review & Research):**

Based on the nature of Gollum and general XSS vulnerabilities, the following areas are likely points of concern:

*   **Markup Processing:** Gollum supports various markup languages (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, etc.).  The core vulnerability lies in how these markup languages are processed and converted to HTML.  If the underlying libraries or Gollum's own processing logic doesn't properly sanitize user input *before* converting it to HTML, an attacker can inject malicious HTML tags and JavaScript.
    *   **Specific Libraries:**  We need to examine the specific libraries used for each markup language (e.g., `Redcarpet` for Markdown, `github-markup` which uses other libraries).  Are these libraries configured securely? Are they up-to-date?  Do they have known XSS vulnerabilities?
    *   **Custom Sanitization:**  Even if the underlying libraries perform *some* sanitization, Gollum might have its own custom sanitization logic.  This is a critical area to review.  Is it robust enough? Does it handle all edge cases?  Gollum uses `sanitize` gem, we need to check how it is configured.
    *   **`--allow-xss` flag:** Gollum has a command-line flag `--allow-xss` (or the equivalent configuration option).  This flag, if enabled, *intentionally disables* XSS protection.  This is a major security risk and should be highlighted.
    *   **`--no-sanitize` flag:** This flag disables HTML sanitization. This is another major security risk.
    *   **Markup-specific bypasses:**  Some markup languages might have features that can be abused to bypass sanitization.  For example, Markdown allows raw HTML in some contexts.  We need to check if Gollum properly handles these cases.

*   **File Uploads:** If Gollum allows users to upload files that are then rendered as part of the page (e.g., SVG images), these files could contain malicious JavaScript.
    *   **SVG Sanitization:**  SVG files are XML-based and can contain `<script>` tags.  Gollum needs to specifically sanitize SVG files to remove or disable these tags.
    *   **Content Type Handling:**  Gollum should serve uploaded files with the correct `Content-Type` header.  If it serves an HTML file with a `text/plain` header, the browser might still try to render it as HTML, leading to XSS.

*   **Comment System (if enabled):** If Gollum has a comment system, the same vulnerabilities that apply to page content also apply to comments.

*   **Database/Storage Interaction:** While less likely to be the *direct* cause of XSS, how Gollum stores and retrieves page content could be relevant.  For example, if it doesn't properly encode data when storing it in the database, a separate vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection) could be used to inject malicious content that then triggers XSS.

* **JavaScript Code:** Review any JavaScript code within Gollum that handles user input or dynamically modifies the DOM.  Look for instances where user-supplied data is inserted into the DOM without proper escaping or sanitization.

**2.2. Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**

The following tests should be performed on a local Gollum instance:

1.  **Basic Payload Injection:**
    *   Attempt to inject a simple alert payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   Try variations: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, `<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>`
    *   Test different locations: page title, page body, comments (if enabled).
    *   Test with different markup languages enabled.

2.  **Markup-Specific Tests:**
    *   **Markdown:**  Try embedding raw HTML: `<div><script>alert('XSS')</script></div>`
    *   **reStructuredText:**  Explore directives that might allow script execution.
    *   **AsciiDoc:**  Similar to reStructuredText, investigate potentially dangerous features.

3.  **File Upload Tests:**
    *   Upload an SVG file containing: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><script>alert('XSS')</script></svg>`
    *   Upload a text file with HTML content and a `.html` extension.  See if Gollum renders it as HTML.

4.  **Bypass Attempts:**
    *   Try encoding techniques: HTML entities (`&lt;script&gt;`), URL encoding (`%3Cscript%3E`), Unicode encoding.
    *   Try obfuscation techniques:  `eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 39, 88, 83, 83, 39, 41))`
    *   Try exploiting any known vulnerabilities in the underlying markup libraries.

5.  **Configuration Tests:**
    *   Test with and without the `--allow-xss` and `--no-sanitize` flags.
    *   Test with different sanitization configurations (if possible).

**2.3. Impact Assessment:**

A successful Stored XSS attack on Gollum can have severe consequences:

*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and access their accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can access and steal sensitive information stored within the wiki, including private pages, user data, and potentially even credentials.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of wiki pages, damaging the integrity and reputation of the wiki.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can inject malicious scripts that redirect users to phishing sites or download malware.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Depending on the configuration and user roles, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges within the wiki or even on the underlying server.
* **Denial of Service:** While not the primary goal of XSS, a malicious script could potentially consume resources or crash the browser, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent Stored XSS in Gollum:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous tags and attributes, use a whitelist approach.  Define a strict set of allowed HTML tags and attributes, and reject anything that doesn't match.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  The sanitization rules should be context-aware.  For example, the allowed attributes for an `<img>` tag are different from those for an `<a>` tag.
    *   **Robust Sanitization Library:**  Use a well-maintained and reputable HTML sanitization library (like the `sanitize` gem in Ruby, but ensure it's configured correctly).  Regularly update this library to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Markup-Specific Handling:**  Ensure that each supported markup language is processed securely.  Use up-to-date and secure libraries for each language.  Configure these libraries to disable any features that could be abused for XSS.
    *   **Disable Raw HTML:**  If possible, completely disable the ability for users to enter raw HTML.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Never enable `--allow-xss` or `--no-sanitize` flags in production environment.**

2.  **Output Encoding:**
    *   **HTML Entity Encoding:**  When displaying user-supplied data in the HTML, always encode it using HTML entities.  This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as HTML tags.  For example, `<` should be encoded as `&lt;`, `>` as `&gt;`, and `"` as `&quot;`.
    *   **Context-Specific Encoding:**  The type of encoding should be appropriate for the context.  For example, if you're inserting user data into a JavaScript string, you need to use JavaScript string encoding.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Implement a Strict CSP:**  CSP is a powerful browser security mechanism that allows you to control the resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) that the browser is allowed to load.  A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of injected scripts, even if the sanitization fails.
    *   **`script-src` Directive:**  Use the `script-src` directive to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.  Ideally, use a nonce-based or hash-based approach to allow only specific, trusted scripts.

4.  **File Upload Security:**
    *   **SVG Sanitization:**  Specifically sanitize SVG files to remove or disable `<script>` tags and other potentially dangerous elements.
    *   **Content Type Validation:**  Validate the `Content-Type` header of uploaded files and ensure that it matches the actual file content.
    *   **File Extension Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific file extensions that are known to be safe.
    *   **Serve Files from a Separate Domain:**  Consider serving uploaded files from a separate domain (or subdomain) to isolate them from the main wiki application. This can help mitigate some XSS risks.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Gollum codebase and configuration.
    *   Perform periodic penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

6.  **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**
    *   Regularly update Gollum and all its dependencies (including markup libraries and the `sanitize` gem) to the latest stable versions.  This ensures that you have the latest security patches.

7.  **Educate Users:**
    *   Inform users about the risks of XSS and encourage them to be cautious when entering data into the wiki.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the risk of Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Gollum can be significantly reduced, protecting users and the integrity of the wiki. The most important steps are robust input sanitization, output encoding, and a strong Content Security Policy.
