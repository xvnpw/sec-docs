Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Gollum (https://github.com/gollum/gollum), a Git-based wiki system.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Authorization Bypass in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to bypassing restrictions on editing/deleting pages within a Gollum wiki instance (attack path 1.5.2).  We aim to identify specific code weaknesses, configuration flaws, and operational practices that could lead to this critical vulnerability.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks.

**Scope:**

This analysis will focus specifically on the Gollum application itself, including:

*   **Gollum's Core Codebase:**  We'll examine the Ruby code responsible for handling page editing, deletion, and authorization checks.  This includes the `gollum-lib` gem, which forms the core logic, and the `gollum` gem, which provides the web interface.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**  We'll analyze how Gollum integrates with authentication providers (if any) and how it enforces authorization rules based on user roles or permissions.  This includes examining how Gollum handles sessions and cookies.
*   **Configuration Options:** We'll investigate configuration settings related to access control, such as those in `config.rb` or environment variables, that could impact authorization enforcement.
*   **Interaction with Git:**  Since Gollum uses Git as its backend, we'll consider how Git operations (commits, branches, etc.) are handled and whether vulnerabilities in Git itself or Gollum's interaction with Git could lead to authorization bypass.
*   **Common Web Vulnerabilities:** We will consider common web application vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to bypass authorization, even if they are not specific to Gollum.

We will *not* focus on:

*   **Infrastructure-level security:**  We won't delve into server hardening, network security, or operating system vulnerabilities, except where they directly interact with Gollum's authorization mechanisms.
*   **Third-party libraries (beyond `gollum-lib` and `gollum`):** While dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities, a comprehensive analysis of all third-party libraries is outside the scope of this specific path analysis.  We will, however, note any known vulnerabilities in commonly used libraries.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks:**  DoS is a separate concern from authorization bypass.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a manual code review of the relevant parts of the Gollum codebase, focusing on areas related to authorization, page editing, and deletion.  We will use static analysis techniques to identify potential flaws.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will set up a test instance of Gollum and perform dynamic testing, attempting to bypass authorization restrictions using various techniques.  This will include:
    *   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  We will manually craft requests and manipulate parameters to try to access restricted pages or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  We will use fuzzing techniques to send malformed or unexpected input to Gollum's API and web interface to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in Gollum, Git, and related libraries.  We will consult vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) and security advisories.
4.  **Configuration Analysis:**  We will examine the default configuration files and documentation to identify potentially insecure settings.
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack scenarios and prioritize mitigation efforts.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.5.2: Bypass Restrictions on Editing/Deleting Pages

This section dives into the specifics of the attack path, exploring potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

**2.1. Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors**

Here are several potential ways an attacker might bypass restrictions on editing/deleting pages in Gollum:

*   **2.1.1.  Insufficient Authorization Checks:**
    *   **Missing Checks:** The most direct vulnerability is simply missing authorization checks in the code that handles page editing and deletion.  For example, a route handler might directly process a request to modify a page without verifying the user's permissions.
    *   **Incorrect Logic:**  The authorization checks might be present but contain logical errors.  For example, a check might incorrectly compare user roles, use a flawed algorithm for determining permissions, or fail to handle edge cases (e.g., empty roles, special characters in usernames).
    *   **Client-Side Enforcement Only:**  If authorization checks are only performed on the client-side (e.g., using JavaScript), an attacker can easily bypass them by modifying the client-side code or sending requests directly to the server.  All authorization checks *must* be performed on the server-side.
    *   **Example (Ruby/Sinatra - Hypothetical):**

        ```ruby
        # VULNERABLE - No authorization check
        post '/edit/:page' do
          page = Gollum::Page.new(wiki).find(params[:page])
          page.update(params[:content])
          redirect "/#{params[:page]}"
        end

        # BETTER - Basic authorization check (but still could be flawed)
        post '/edit/:page' do
          if authorized? # Needs thorough implementation and testing!
            page = Gollum::Page.new(wiki).find(params[:page])
            page.update(params[:content])
            redirect "/#{params[:page]}"
          else
            halt 403, "Forbidden"
          end
        end
        ```

*   **2.1.2.  Path Traversal:**
    *   Gollum stores pages as files within the Git repository.  If Gollum doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input used to construct file paths, an attacker might be able to use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to access or modify files outside the intended wiki directory.  This could allow them to edit or delete pages they shouldn't have access to, or even to modify Gollum's configuration files or code.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical):**  If Gollum uses `params[:page]` directly in a file path without sanitization, an attacker could submit a request with `page=../../config.rb` to potentially modify the configuration file.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used to construct file paths.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-safe characters.  Consider using a dedicated library for path manipulation that handles sanitization securely.

*   **2.1.3.  Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** If Gollum uses user-supplied input in shell commands (e.g., to interact with Git), an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands.  This could allow them to bypass authorization checks and modify or delete pages, or even gain full control of the server.
    *   **SQL Injection (If applicable):**  While Gollum primarily uses Git, if it interacts with a database for any reason (e.g., for user management), SQL injection vulnerabilities could be present.  These could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or modify user permissions.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using user-supplied input directly in shell commands.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.  Sanitize all user input thoroughly.

*   **2.1.4.  Session Management Issues:**
    *   **Session Fixation:**  An attacker might be able to fixate a user's session ID, allowing them to hijack the user's session after they log in.  If the user has edit/delete permissions, the attacker could then use the hijacked session to modify or delete pages.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  If session IDs are predictable or can be intercepted (e.g., due to lack of HTTPS or weak encryption), an attacker could hijack a user's session.
    *   **Insufficient Session Timeout:**  If sessions don't expire after a reasonable period of inactivity, an attacker might be able to gain access to a stale session.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a strong, randomly generated session ID.  Regenerate the session ID after login.  Enforce HTTPS for all communication.  Implement proper session timeouts.  Use a secure session management library.

*   **2.1.5.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   An attacker could trick a logged-in user with edit/delete permissions into visiting a malicious website that sends a forged request to the Gollum server.  This request could modify or delete a page without the user's knowledge.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement CSRF protection using anti-CSRF tokens.  These tokens should be unique per session and per request, and should be validated by the server before processing any state-changing request.

*   **2.1.6.  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   While XSS itself doesn't directly bypass authorization, it can be used to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.  If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a Gollum page, they could potentially steal the session cookie of a user with edit/delete permissions and then use that cookie to bypass authorization.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Properly sanitize all user-supplied input to prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript.  Use a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output.

*   **2.1.7.  Git-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Git Hooks Abuse:**  If Gollum uses Git hooks (e.g., `pre-receive`, `post-receive`) for authorization or other security-related tasks, vulnerabilities in the hook scripts could be exploited.  For example, a poorly written hook script might be vulnerable to command injection.
    *   **Direct Git Access:**  If an attacker gains direct access to the Git repository (e.g., through a compromised server account or a misconfigured Git server), they could bypass Gollum's authorization checks entirely and modify or delete pages directly.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully review and audit any Git hook scripts.  Restrict access to the Git repository to authorized users and processes only.  Use a secure Git server configuration.

*    **2.1.8. Gollum specific configuration issues:**
    *   **Weak or Default Credentials:** If Gollum is configured with weak or default credentials for administrative accounts, an attacker could easily gain access.
    *   **Misconfigured Access Control:** Gollum's configuration file (`config.rb`) might contain settings that inadvertently grant excessive permissions to users or groups.
    *   **Disabled Security Features:** Gollum might have security features that are disabled by default.
    *   **Mitigation:** Change default credentials immediately after installation. Carefully review and configure access control settings. Enable all relevant security features.

**2.2.  Prioritization and Risk Assessment**

The vulnerabilities listed above have varying levels of risk and likelihood.  Here's a rough prioritization:

*   **High Risk:**
    *   Insufficient Authorization Checks (Missing, Incorrect, Client-Side Only)
    *   Path Traversal
    *   Command Injection
    *   Git Hooks Abuse (if hooks are used for authorization)
    *   Direct Git Access
    *   Weak or Default Credentials
    *   Misconfigured Access Control

*   **Medium Risk:**
    *   Session Fixation/Hijacking
    *   CSRF
    *   SQL Injection (if applicable)

*   **Low Risk (but still important):**
    *   XSS (as a means to escalate to authorization bypass)
    *   Insufficient Session Timeout
    *   Disabled Security Features

**2.3. Mitigation Strategies (General)**

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices throughout the Gollum codebase.  This includes input validation, output encoding, proper error handling, and secure session management.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.  Avoid granting excessive permissions.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Gollum codebase and configuration.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners to automatically detect known vulnerabilities.
*   **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Gollum, Git, and all related libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor Logs:**  Monitor Gollum's logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help to protect against common web attacks, such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
*   **Use a Secure Git Server:**  If you're hosting your own Git server, ensure that it's configured securely.

**2.4. Specific Recommendations for Gollum**

*   **Thoroughly review the `gollum-lib` and `gollum` codebases for authorization checks.**  Ensure that all routes that handle page editing and deletion have proper authorization checks.  Pay close attention to the logic of these checks to ensure they are correct and cannot be bypassed.
*   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization.**  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.  Validate all user-supplied input used to construct file paths, shell commands, and database queries.
*   **Implement CSRF protection.**  Use anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.
*   **Ensure secure session management.**  Use strong, randomly generated session IDs.  Regenerate session IDs after login.  Enforce HTTPS.  Implement proper session timeouts.
*   **Review and audit any Git hook scripts.**  Ensure they are secure and cannot be exploited.
*   **Restrict access to the Git repository.**  Only authorized users and processes should have access.
*   **Change default credentials immediately after installation.**
*   **Carefully review and configure access control settings in `config.rb`.**
*   **Enable all relevant security features.**
*   **Consider using a dedicated authentication and authorization library.**  This can help to simplify the implementation of secure authentication and authorization and reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Regularly test Gollum's authorization mechanisms.**  Use a combination of manual penetration testing and automated vulnerability scanning.
