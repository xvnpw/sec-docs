# Deep Analysis of Gollum Wiki Attack Tree Path: Exposed Sensitive Files/Directories

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the attack path related to the exposure of sensitive files and directories within a Gollum Wiki instance, specifically focusing on the `.git` directory and backup files.  We aim to understand the practical exploitability, potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies for these vulnerabilities.  This analysis will inform development and operational practices to enhance the security posture of Gollum deployments.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

**2.2. Exposed Sensitive Files/Directories (.git, backups, etc.) [HR]**

*   **2.2.1. Access .git directory to retrieve source code and history [CRITICAL]:**
*   **2.2.2 Access backup files to retrieve old versions of pages:**

The scope includes:

*   **Gollum Wiki Versions:**  While the analysis aims for general applicability, we will consider potential differences in behavior across various Gollum versions (especially focusing on common, recent versions).  We will note any version-specific findings.
*   **Deployment Environments:**  We will consider common deployment scenarios, including:
    *   Directly running Gollum (e.g., `gollum --port 4567`)
    *   Deployment behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
    *   Containerized deployments (e.g., Docker)
*   **Underlying Git Repository:**  The analysis assumes a standard Git repository backend, as this is Gollum's default.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities arising from misconfigured web servers *themselves* (e.g., directory listing enabled on the web server level).  It focuses on Gollum's specific handling of sensitive files and how a misconfiguration *within Gollum's context* or a failure to properly configure the *surrounding environment* could lead to exposure.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Gollum source code (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gollum/gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)) to identify how Gollum handles requests for files, particularly focusing on:
    *   Any logic that might explicitly or implicitly expose the `.git` directory or backup files.
    *   Configuration options related to file access and security.
    *   Dependencies that might introduce vulnerabilities related to file handling.

2.  **Testing (Local Environment):**  Set up a local Gollum instance and attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities. This will involve:
    *   Directly accessing the `.git` directory and its contents via a web browser.
    *   Attempting to access known backup file locations (if any are created by default).
    *   Testing different deployment configurations (with and without a reverse proxy).
    *   Trying common variations of requests (e.g., URL encoding, path traversal attempts).

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and reports related to Gollum and its dependencies, specifically focusing on issues related to file exposure.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the official Gollum documentation for any security recommendations or warnings related to file access and deployment best practices.

5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider various attacker profiles and their motivations for exploiting these vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1.  2.2.1. Access .git directory to retrieve source code and history [CRITICAL]

**Threat:**  An attacker can directly access the `.git` directory of the Gollum Wiki repository via a web browser or other HTTP client.  This grants them access to the complete version history of the wiki, including all past revisions of pages, commit messages, and potentially sensitive information that may have been committed and later removed from the live version.

**Exploitability:**  High.  If the web server serving the Gollum Wiki is not configured to deny access to the `.git` directory, it is typically directly accessible.  Gollum itself does not (by default) have built-in mechanisms to prevent access to the `.git` directory *at the application level*.  It relies on the web server or deployment environment to enforce this restriction.

**Impact:**  Critical.  Exposure of the `.git` directory can lead to:

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Leakage of sensitive information (passwords, API keys, internal documentation, etc.) that was inadvertently committed to the repository.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:**  Exposure of the wiki's content history, which could reveal intellectual property or confidential information.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The attacker can analyze the commit history to identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the wiki's content or configuration.  They might find old, vulnerable code or configurations that were later patched.

**Code Review Findings (gollum/gollum):**

*   Gollum's core functionality relies on interacting with the Git repository.  It does *not* include specific code to block access to the `.git` directory.
*   The documentation (and common deployment practices) strongly emphasize the need to configure the web server to prevent access to `.git`.

**Testing Results:**

*   **Direct Gollum Instance (no reverse proxy):**  If Gollum is run directly (e.g., `gollum --port 4567`) and the `.git` directory is within the web root, it is *highly likely* to be accessible.  Testing confirmed that accessing `http://localhost:4567/.git/HEAD` (or other `.git` files) directly returns the file contents.
*   **With Reverse Proxy (Nginx/Apache):**  The exploitability depends entirely on the reverse proxy configuration.  A properly configured reverse proxy will block access to `.git`.  An improperly configured one will not.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Web Server Configuration (Essential):**  The *primary* mitigation is to configure the web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to deny access to the `.git` directory.  This is a standard security practice for *any* web application using Git.
    *   **Nginx Example:**

        ```nginx
        location ~ /\.git {
            deny all;
        }
        ```

    *   **Apache Example:**

        ```apache
        <DirectoryMatch "^/.*/\.git/">
            Require all denied
        </DirectoryMatch>
        ```

2.  **Containerization (Best Practice):**  When deploying Gollum in a container (e.g., Docker), ensure that the `.git` directory is *not* exposed in the container's exposed volume or mount point.  The Gollum application itself should be run from a separate directory within the container. This adds an extra layer of isolation.

3.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the user account under which Gollum runs has the minimum necessary permissions to access the Git repository.  It should not have write access to the web server's root directory.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review the web server configuration and deployment setup to ensure that the `.git` directory remains inaccessible.

5. **.gitignore usage:** Ensure that sensitive files are never added to git repository.

### 4.2.  2.2.2 Access backup files to retrieve old versions of pages

**Threat:**  An attacker can locate and access backup files created by Gollum or the underlying system, potentially revealing older versions of wiki pages that contain sensitive information.

**Exploitability:**  Medium to High (depending on configuration and backup strategy).  Gollum itself does not have a built-in, automatic backup mechanism that creates easily accessible files *within the web root*. However:

*   **Manual Backups:**  Administrators might create manual backups of the wiki repository (e.g., by copying the entire directory) and inadvertently place these backups within the web root.
*   **System-Level Backups:**  System-level backup tools (e.g., `rsync`, `tar`) might create backup files (e.g., `.tar.gz`, `.bak`) in the same directory as the wiki repository, making them accessible if the web server is not configured to deny access.
*   **Editor Backups:** Text editors used to modify wiki files directly (if this is permitted) might create backup files (e.g., `page.md~`, `page.md.bak`) within the wiki directory.

**Impact:**  High.  Similar to the `.git` exposure, accessing backup files can reveal sensitive information that was previously present in the wiki but has since been removed.

**Code Review Findings (gollum/gollum):**

*   Gollum does not have built-in backup functionality that would create files in predictable, web-accessible locations.

**Testing Results:**

*   **Manual Backup Simulation:**  Creating a manual backup (e.g., `cp -r mywiki mywiki.bak`) and placing it within the web root made it directly accessible.
*   **Editor Backup Simulation:**  Editing a file with a text editor that creates backup files (e.g., Vim) resulted in a `~` backup file being created, which was accessible if the web server did not block it.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Web Server Configuration (Essential):**  Configure the web server to deny access to common backup file extensions (e.g., `.bak`, `~`, `.tar.gz`, `.zip`, `.old`).  This is a crucial step, similar to blocking `.git`.
    *   **Nginx Example:**

        ```nginx
        location ~ /\. {
            deny all;
        }
        location ~* \.(bak|old|tar\.gz|zip|~)$ {
            deny all;
        }
        ```

    *   **Apache Example:**

        ```apache
        <FilesMatch "\.(bak|old|tar\.gz|zip|~)$">
            Require all denied
        </FilesMatch>
        ```
2.  **Secure Backup Practices:**
    *   **Store Backups Outside the Web Root:**  Never store backups within the web-accessible directory.  Use a separate, dedicated directory for backups.
    *   **Automated Backup Scripts:**  Use scripts to automate backups and ensure they are stored securely.
    *   **Restrict Access to Backup Directory:**  Use file system permissions to restrict access to the backup directory.

3.  **Editor Configuration:**  If direct file editing is allowed, configure editors to store backup files in a separate, non-web-accessible location.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly check for the presence of unexpected backup files within the web root.

## 5. Conclusion

The exposure of the `.git` directory and backup files represents a significant security risk for Gollum Wiki deployments.  While Gollum itself does not inherently expose these files, it relies heavily on proper web server configuration and secure deployment practices to prevent unauthorized access.  The primary mitigation is to configure the web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to deny access to these sensitive files and directories.  Following secure backup practices and containerization best practices further enhances security.  Regular security audits are crucial to ensure that these mitigations remain effective over time.  Failure to implement these mitigations can lead to critical information disclosure and potentially compromise the entire wiki.
