Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Gollum, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis of Gollum RCE Attack Tree Path

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks against a Gollum wiki instance, specifically focusing on the identified attack paths: exploiting vulnerabilities in user input parsing and leveraging vulnerable dependencies.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific code areas and functionalities within Gollum and its dependencies that are most susceptible to these attack vectors.
*   Assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and security best practices to reduce the risk of RCE.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis will focus on the following:

*   **Gollum Core:** The core codebase of the Gollum wiki engine itself (https://github.com/gollum/gollum).  This includes, but is not limited to, the Markdown parsing logic, file upload handling, and any other areas that process user-supplied data.
*   **Key Dependencies:**  Critical dependencies that Gollum relies on for core functionality, particularly those involved in:
    *   Markdown rendering (e.g., `github-markup`, potentially older versions of libraries like `kramdown`, `redcarpet`).
    *   File handling (e.g., libraries used for image processing, if any).
    *   Web framework components (Gollum uses Sinatra).
    *   Git interaction (e.g., `rugged`, `grit`).
*   **Attack Path:** Specifically, attack tree path 1.6 (RCE) and its sub-paths 1.6.1 (Exploit vulnerability in parsing user input) and 1.6.2 (Leverage vulnerable dependencies).  We will *not* deeply analyze other attack vectors outside this path (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly contribute to RCE.
*   **Version:** We will primarily focus on the latest stable release of Gollum, but will also consider known vulnerabilities in older versions to understand the historical context and potential for regressions.
* **Deployment:** We will assume a standard deployment, where gollum is running as a web application.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Gollum source code and the source code of its key dependencies, focusing on areas identified as high-risk (input validation, sanitization, external library calls).  We will use static analysis principles to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Utilizing tools like `bundle audit` (for Ruby projects), OWASP Dependency-Check, or Snyk to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.  This will involve examining the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD, GitHub Security Advisories) for known RCE vulnerabilities in Gollum and its dependencies.  We will also review past security advisories and bug reports related to Gollum.
4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live penetration testing in this analysis, we will *conceptually* describe how dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing, manual testing with malicious payloads) could be used to validate potential vulnerabilities.
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Considering the attacker's perspective and potential attack scenarios to identify weaknesses in the application's design and implementation.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.6: Remote Code Execution (RCE)

### 2.1. Attack Path 1.6.1: Exploit Vulnerability in Parsing User Input

This attack path focuses on how an attacker could craft malicious input to trigger code execution.  Gollum, as a wiki engine, inherently deals with a lot of user-supplied data, making this a critical area of concern.

**2.1.1. Markdown Parsing:**

*   **Vulnerability Potential:** Markdown parsers are complex and have historically been a source of vulnerabilities.  The core risk is that specially crafted Markdown could be interpreted in a way that allows the attacker to inject code or commands.  This could involve:
    *   **Bypassing Sanitization:**  If Gollum's sanitization logic (intended to remove dangerous HTML or script tags) is flawed, an attacker could craft Markdown that bypasses these checks.
    *   **Exploiting Parser Bugs:**  The underlying Markdown parsing library itself might have bugs that allow for code execution when processing specific, unusual Markdown constructs.  This is particularly relevant if Gollum uses an older or unmaintained Markdown library.
    *   **Command Injection in Custom Macros/Extensions:** If Gollum supports custom macros or extensions that allow embedding code or commands within Markdown, these could be abused if not properly validated.
    *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Although less likely with Markdown, if the rendered Markdown is further processed by a templating engine, there's a potential for SSTI.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `Gollum::Markup` class and related files in the Gollum codebase.
    *   Identify the specific Markdown parsing library being used (e.g., by checking `Gemfile.lock`).
    *   Analyze the sanitization routines applied to the rendered Markdown output.  Look for potential bypasses or weaknesses.
    *   Investigate any custom Markdown extensions or macros and their validation logic.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a Secure and Up-to-Date Markdown Parser:**  Ensure Gollum is using a well-maintained Markdown library with a strong security track record.  Regularly update this dependency.
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization:**  Implement a strict whitelist-based sanitization approach, allowing only known-safe HTML tags and attributes.  Avoid blacklist-based approaches, which are prone to bypasses.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:**  Properly escape user input in the context where it's being used (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to limit the execution of inline scripts and other potentially dangerous content, even if sanitization fails.
    *   **Regular Expression Review:** If regular expressions are used for input validation or sanitization, carefully review them for potential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities, which could lead to a denial-of-service and potentially be escalated.

**2.1.2. File Uploads:**

*   **Vulnerability Potential:**  File uploads are a classic attack vector.  The risks include:
    *   **Uploading Executable Files:**  An attacker might upload a script (e.g., a `.rb` file, a shell script) that could be executed by the server.
    *   **Exploiting Image Processing Libraries:**  If Gollum processes uploaded images (e.g., for resizing or thumbnail generation), vulnerabilities in the image processing library (e.g., ImageMagick, RMagick) could be exploited.  "ImageTragick" is a well-known example of such a vulnerability.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  An attacker might try to upload a file with a manipulated filename (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) to overwrite critical system files.
    *   **Double Extensions:** Uploading files with double extensions (e.g., `malicious.jpg.rb`) to bypass extension checks.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the code responsible for handling file uploads in Gollum (likely within controllers or models related to page editing).
    *   Identify any image processing libraries used.
    *   Check how file extensions are validated and how uploaded files are stored.
    *   Look for any potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:**  Validate file types based on *content*, not just the file extension.  Use libraries like `file` (the command-line utility) or Ruby's `MIME::Types` to determine the actual file type.
    *   **Filename Sanitization:**  Sanitize filenames to remove any potentially dangerous characters or sequences (e.g., directory traversal characters).  Consider generating unique filenames for uploaded files.
    *   **Store Uploads Outside the Web Root:**  Store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* directly accessible via the web server.  Serve them through a dedicated controller that performs authentication and authorization checks.
    *   **Use a Secure Image Processing Library:**  If image processing is required, use a well-maintained and secure library.  Keep it up-to-date.  Consider sandboxing the image processing process.
    *   **Limit File Size:**  Enforce a reasonable maximum file size to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Disable Execution:** Ensure that the directory where files are uploaded has execution disabled.

### 2.2. Attack Path 1.6.2: Leverage Vulnerable Dependencies

This attack path focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Gollum.

*   **Vulnerability Potential:**  All software projects rely on dependencies, and these dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities.  If Gollum uses a library with a known RCE vulnerability, an attacker could exploit that vulnerability to gain control of the server.

*   **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Use `bundle audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems.  This tool compares the versions of gems listed in `Gemfile.lock` against a database of known vulnerabilities.
        ```bash
        bundle audit check --update
        ```
    *   Use OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to perform a more comprehensive dependency analysis, including checking for vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies).
    *   Manually review the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to identify key dependencies and research their security history.  Pay particular attention to:
        *   Markdown parsing libraries (as discussed above).
        *   Web framework components (Sinatra).
        *   Git interaction libraries (`rugged`, `grit`).
        *   Any libraries used for file handling or image processing.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable versions.  Use tools like `bundle update` to update gems.
    *   **Use a Dependency Management Tool:**  Use a tool like `bundle audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check, or Snyk to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Pin Dependency Versions:**  Pin dependency versions in `Gemfile` to specific versions or use version ranges that exclude known vulnerable versions.  This prevents accidental upgrades to vulnerable versions.
    *   **Vendor Dependencies (If Necessary):**  In extreme cases, if a critical dependency has a known vulnerability and no patch is available, consider vendoring the dependency (copying the source code into the Gollum project) and applying a patch manually.  This is a last resort, as it increases maintenance overhead.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Gollum with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running it as root.  This limits the impact of a successful RCE.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a critical vulnerability that could allow an attacker to completely compromise a Gollum wiki instance.  This analysis has identified two primary attack paths: exploiting vulnerabilities in user input parsing and leveraging vulnerable dependencies.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Dependency Management:**  Implement a robust dependency management process, including regular updates, vulnerability scanning, and version pinning.  This is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of RCE from vulnerable dependencies.
2.  **Secure Markdown Parsing:**  Ensure Gollum uses a secure and up-to-date Markdown parser.  Implement strict input sanitization and a strong Content Security Policy.
3.  **Secure File Uploads:**  Implement strict file type validation, filename sanitization, and store uploaded files outside the web root.
4.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security-focused code reviews, paying particular attention to areas that handle user input and interact with external libraries.
5.  **Automated Security Testing:**  Integrate automated security testing tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline.
6.  **Least Privilege:** Run Gollum with the least privileges necessary.
7. **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and bug reports related to Gollum and its dependencies.
8. **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering malicious traffic and blocking known attack patterns.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of RCE vulnerabilities in Gollum and improve the overall security of the application. This proactive approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the wiki data.
