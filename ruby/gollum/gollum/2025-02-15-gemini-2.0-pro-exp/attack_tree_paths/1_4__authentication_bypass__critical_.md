Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Gollum (the wiki software) and its potential vulnerabilities.

## Deep Analysis of Authentication Bypass in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Authentication Bypass" attack path (specifically 1.4.2 and 1.4.3) within the Gollum wiki application, identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance Gollum's security posture against these specific threats.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Gollum's authentication mechanisms:**  We'll examine how Gollum handles user authentication, including password storage, session management, and any integration with external authentication providers (e.g., OmniAuth).  We'll assume a default or typical Gollum setup, but also consider common configurations.
*   **Brute-force attacks (1.4.2):**  We'll analyze Gollum's susceptibility to brute-force and dictionary attacks against user accounts.  This includes evaluating any existing rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Session hijacking (1.4.3):** We'll investigate how Gollum manages user sessions, including the generation, storage, and transmission of session identifiers.  We'll look for vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to steal or predict session IDs.
*   **Impact on Gollum's functionality:** We'll assess the potential consequences of successful authentication bypass, including unauthorized access to wiki content, modification of pages, and potential privilege escalation.
* **Dependencies:** Gollum relies on several external libraries (e.g., Rack, Sinatra, various authentication gems).  We'll consider vulnerabilities in these dependencies that could contribute to the attack path.
* **Codebase Review:** We will review relevant parts of Gollum's codebase, focusing on authentication and session management logic.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Attacks targeting the underlying operating system or web server (e.g., SSH brute-forcing, server-level vulnerabilities).  We're focusing on application-level vulnerabilities within Gollum itself.
*   Other attack tree paths (e.g., XSS, CSRF) are only considered *insofar* as they directly contribute to session hijacking (1.4.3).  A full XSS or CSRF analysis is separate.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unless directly related to the brute-force attack (e.g., overwhelming the authentication system).

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Gollum source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand:
    *   How authentication is implemented (e.g., `gollum-lib` and any authentication-related gems).
    *   Password storage mechanisms (hashing algorithms, salting).
    *   Session management (how session IDs are generated, stored, and validated).
    *   Any existing security measures (rate limiting, account lockout).
    *   Interaction with external authentication providers (if used).

2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identify and review the security advisories and known vulnerabilities of Gollum's dependencies, particularly those related to authentication and session management.  Tools like `bundler-audit` or Snyk can be helpful here.

3.  **Dynamic Testing (Conceptual):**  Describe how we would *conceptually* test for these vulnerabilities.  We won't actually perform live penetration testing, but we'll outline the testing approach. This includes:
    *   Attempting brute-force attacks with tools like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder.
    *   Testing for session hijacking vulnerabilities by:
        *   Inspecting session cookies for predictability (e.g., sequential IDs).
        *   Attempting to capture session cookies through network sniffing (in a controlled environment).
        *   Testing for XSS vulnerabilities that could be used to steal cookies.
        *   Checking for session fixation vulnerabilities.

4.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Based on the code review, dependency analysis, and conceptual testing, assess the likelihood and impact of each vulnerability.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.  These recommendations should be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 1.4.2. Brute-force Weak Passwords

**Code Review Findings (Expected/Potential):**

*   **Password Storage:** Gollum, by default, likely relies on a gem like `bcrypt` (via a higher-level authentication gem) to hash passwords.  `bcrypt` is a strong hashing algorithm, which is good.  However, the *configuration* of `bcrypt` is crucial.  The "cost factor" determines the computational effort required to hash a password.  A low cost factor makes brute-forcing easier.  We need to check the configured cost factor.
*   **Rate Limiting/Account Lockout:**  Gollum *may* have some basic rate limiting implemented, possibly through Rack middleware (e.g., `Rack::Attack`).  However, this is often not enabled or configured aggressively enough by default.  We need to examine the presence and configuration of any rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms.  Without these, Gollum is highly vulnerable.
*   **Authentication Gems:** Gollum might use gems like `warden` or a custom authentication solution.  We need to inspect the chosen gem and its configuration for best practices.

**Dependency Analysis:**

*   Vulnerabilities in `bcrypt` itself are unlikely, but we should check for any known issues in the specific version used by Gollum.
*   Vulnerabilities in the authentication gem (e.g., `warden`, or a custom solution) could exist and should be investigated.
*   If `Rack::Attack` is used, we need to check for vulnerabilities in that gem and ensure it's properly configured.

**Conceptual Dynamic Testing:**

1.  **Basic Brute-Force:** Use a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder with a list of common usernames and passwords to attempt to log in.  Observe the response times and any error messages.
2.  **Rate Limiting Test:**  Attempt multiple login attempts in rapid succession.  Observe if the application starts rejecting requests or introduces delays.
3.  **Account Lockout Test:**  Attempt multiple incorrect login attempts for a single user.  Observe if the account becomes locked out.

**Vulnerability Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:**  High, if rate limiting and account lockout are not implemented or are poorly configured.  The prevalence of weak passwords makes this a common attack vector.
*   **Impact:**  High.  Successful brute-forcing grants the attacker full access to the compromised user's account, allowing them to view, modify, or delete wiki content.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements) through configuration or custom validation logic.
2.  **Robust Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting using `Rack::Attack` or a similar mechanism.  This should limit the number of login attempts per IP address and/or per user within a given time window.  Consider both global and per-user rate limits.
3.  **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.  The lockout duration should be configurable, and there should be a mechanism for users to unlock their accounts (e.g., email verification).
4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Implement 2FA (e.g., using TOTP) to add an extra layer of security.  This makes brute-forcing significantly harder, even with weak passwords.
5.  **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Log all login attempts (successful and failed) and monitor these logs for suspicious activity.  Consider using a security information and event management (SIEM) system.
6.  **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA on the login page to deter automated brute-force attacks. However, be mindful of the usability impact of CAPTCHAs.
7.  **`bcrypt` Cost Factor:** Ensure the `bcrypt` cost factor is set to a sufficiently high value (e.g., 12 or higher) to make brute-forcing computationally expensive.

#### 1.4.3. Session Hijacking (if session management is flawed)

**Code Review Findings (Expected/Potential):**

*   **Session ID Generation:** Gollum likely uses Rack's session management, which typically relies on a secure random number generator to create session IDs.  We need to verify this and ensure the generated IDs are sufficiently long and random.  Predictable session IDs are a major vulnerability.
*   **Session Storage:** Gollum can store sessions in various ways (e.g., cookies, server-side storage).  Cookie-based sessions are the most common.  We need to examine the cookie attributes:
    *   **`HttpOnly`:**  This flag prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking.  It *must* be set.
    *   **`Secure`:**  This flag ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS.  It *must* be set in a production environment.
    *   **`SameSite`:**  This flag helps prevent CSRF attacks, which can indirectly lead to session hijacking.  It should be set to `Strict` or `Lax`.
    *   **Expiration:**  Session cookies should have a reasonable expiration time.
*   **Session Fixation:**  Gollum should generate a new session ID *after* successful authentication.  Failure to do so allows for session fixation attacks, where an attacker can pre-set a session ID and then trick the victim into using it.
* **Session Invalidation:** Gollum should properly invalidate sessions on logout and after a period of inactivity.

**Dependency Analysis:**

*   Vulnerabilities in Rack's session management are possible, but less likely if using a recent version.  We should check for any known issues.
*   If Gollum uses a separate gem for session management, we need to analyze that gem's security.

**Conceptual Dynamic Testing:**

1.  **Session ID Predictability:**  Create multiple user accounts and observe the generated session IDs.  Look for patterns or sequential numbering.
2.  **Cookie Attribute Inspection:**  Use browser developer tools to inspect the session cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`, expiration).
3.  **Network Sniffing (Controlled Environment):**  Use a tool like Wireshark to capture network traffic (in a controlled, ethical environment) and observe the session cookie being transmitted.  Verify it's only sent over HTTPS.
4.  **XSS Testing (Targeted):**  Test for XSS vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session cookies.  This is a separate, broader attack vector, but it's relevant here.
5.  **Session Fixation Test:**  Try to set a session cookie before logging in, then log in and see if the same cookie is still used.
6.  **Session Invalidation Test:** Log out of the application and then try to use the old session cookie to access protected resources.

**Vulnerability Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:**  Medium to High, depending on the configuration and presence of vulnerabilities like XSS.  If `HttpOnly` and `Secure` are not set, the likelihood is very high.
*   **Impact:**  High.  Session hijacking allows the attacker to impersonate the victim user, gaining full access to their account and wiki content.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` Flags:**  Ensure the session cookie has the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes set correctly.  This is crucial.
2.  **Secure Session ID Generation:**  Verify that Gollum uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to create session IDs.  The IDs should be sufficiently long (e.g., at least 128 bits).
3.  **Session Regeneration:**  Generate a new session ID after successful authentication to prevent session fixation attacks.
4.  **Session Timeout:**  Implement a reasonable session timeout (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity) to automatically invalidate sessions.
5.  **Proper Session Invalidation:**  Ensure sessions are properly invalidated on logout.
6.  **Protect Against XSS:**  Implement robust defenses against XSS attacks, as these can be used to steal session cookies.  This includes proper input validation, output encoding, and potentially a Content Security Policy (CSP).
7.  **Consider Server-Side Session Storage:**  Storing sessions on the server (e.g., in a database or cache) can provide additional security, as the session ID is the only thing transmitted to the client.
8. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address session management vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

Authentication bypass is a critical vulnerability for any application, and Gollum is no exception.  Brute-force attacks and session hijacking are two common and effective methods for achieving this bypass.  By addressing the vulnerabilities outlined above and implementing the recommended mitigations, the Gollum development team can significantly improve the application's security and protect user accounts and data.  The most important immediate steps are to ensure proper rate limiting, account lockout, secure session cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), and session regeneration after login.  Longer-term, implementing 2FA and conducting regular security audits are highly recommended.
