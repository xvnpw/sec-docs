Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Gollum's potential vulnerabilities related to insecure file uploads.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Insecure File Uploads in Gollum

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path related to insecure file uploads in Gollum, specifically focusing on the ability of an attacker to upload and potentially execute malicious files.  This analysis aims to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose mitigation strategies.  We will focus on the practical implications within the context of Gollum's architecture and intended use.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of Gollum (version as of today, Oct 26, 2023, and considering recent commits):

*   **File Upload Mechanism:** How Gollum handles file uploads, including the underlying libraries and frameworks used.
*   **File Type Validation:**  The methods Gollum employs (or *should* employ) to validate uploaded file types and prevent the upload of executable scripts.
*   **File Storage:** Where and how uploaded files are stored, and the permissions associated with those storage locations.
*   **Execution Context:**  Under what circumstances uploaded files might be executed or interpreted by the server, even if they are not explicitly intended to be executable.
*   **Interaction with Git:**  How Gollum's reliance on Git for version control impacts the risk and mitigation of file upload vulnerabilities.
*   **Gollum's Configuration:**  Settings and options within Gollum that can influence the security of file uploads.
*   **Dependencies:**  Vulnerabilities in underlying libraries (e.g., Rack, Grit, web server configurations) that could be exploited in conjunction with a file upload.

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities that are purely client-side (e.g., XSS attacks that don't involve server-side execution of uploaded files).  It also excludes attacks that are entirely unrelated to file uploads (e.g., SQL injection, if applicable).

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the Gollum source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand the file upload handling logic, validation routines, and storage mechanisms.  This will be the primary method.
*   **Literature Review:**  Searching for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to Gollum and its dependencies, as well as general best practices for secure file upload handling.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describing how one might *test* for these vulnerabilities in a running instance of Gollum, even without actually performing the tests. This includes outlining potential attack payloads and expected outcomes.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Considering the attacker's perspective, motivations, and capabilities to identify likely attack vectors and scenarios.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifying key dependencies and researching their known vulnerabilities related to file uploads.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.3: Insecure File Uploads

**2.3. Insecure File Uploads [HR]**

*   **2.3.1. Upload malicious file (e.g., shell script) [CRITICAL]:**

    *   **Vulnerability Description:** This is the core vulnerability.  If an attacker can upload a file containing executable code (e.g., a PHP script, a shell script, a Python script, or even a specially crafted HTML file with embedded server-side scripting), and that code is subsequently executed by the server, the attacker gains significant control over the system.  The severity depends on the execution context (user privileges, system access).

    *   **Gollum-Specific Considerations:**
        *   **Intended File Types:** Gollum is primarily designed for wiki content (Markdown, reStructuredText, etc.).  Executable scripts are *not* intended to be uploaded.  This makes any successful upload of an executable script a clear violation of intended functionality.
        *   **Git as a Mitigation (Partial):** Gollum stores files in a Git repository.  This provides some inherent protection:
            *   **Version Control:**  Malicious uploads are tracked, and rollbacks are possible.
            *   **No Direct Execution (Usually):** Git itself doesn't execute files.  However, this is *not* a complete mitigation.  The web server serving the Gollum wiki *could* be configured to execute files from the Git repository, especially if the repository is directly exposed to the web root.
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** The *most critical factor* is the web server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx).  If the web server is configured to execute files with certain extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.py`, `.sh`) within the Gollum repository's directory, then a successful upload of such a file becomes a critical vulnerability.
        *   **Rack Middleware:** Gollum uses Rack.  Rack itself doesn't inherently execute uploaded files, but misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Rack middleware *could* lead to execution.

    *   **Potential Attack Payloads:**
        *   `.php` file containing `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` (allows arbitrary command execution via a URL parameter).
        *   `.sh` file containing a reverse shell script.
        *   `.py` file with malicious code that interacts with the system.
        *   `.html` file with server-side includes (SSI) enabled, allowing execution of commands.

    *   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, defacement, use of the server for further attacks (e.g., botnet participation).

    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Crucial):**
        *   **Strict File Type Whitelisting:**  *Never* rely on blacklisting.  Only allow a specific set of known-safe file extensions (e.g., `.md`, `.rst`, `.txt`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`).  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **File Content Inspection:**  Go beyond file extensions.  Examine the *content* of the file to ensure it matches the expected type.  For example, use a library to verify that a `.png` file actually contains a valid PNG image.
        *   **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Store uploaded files with randomly generated names (e.g., UUIDs) to prevent attackers from predicting the file path and accessing it directly.
        *   **Secure Web Server Configuration:**  *Absolutely crucial*.  Ensure the web server is configured to *never* execute files from the Gollum repository's directory.  Use `.htaccess` files (Apache) or equivalent configurations (Nginx) to deny execution permissions.  Serve the wiki content as static files.
        *   **Separate Upload Directory:**  Store uploaded files in a directory *outside* the web root, and serve them through a dedicated script that performs additional validation.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the Gollum application and the web server with the lowest possible privileges.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update Gollum and all its dependencies (Rack, Grit, web server, etc.) to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **2.3.2. Bypass file type restrictions:**

    *   **Vulnerability Description:**  This describes the techniques an attacker might use to circumvent file type validation mechanisms.

    *   **Common Bypass Techniques:**
        *   **Double Extensions:**  Uploading a file named `malicious.php.jpg`.  If the validation only checks the last extension, it might be allowed.
        *   **MIME Type Manipulation:**  Sending a file with a manipulated `Content-Type` header (e.g., claiming a PHP script is an image/jpeg).
        *   **Null Byte Injection:**  Using a null byte (`%00`) to truncate the filename (e.g., `malicious.php%00.jpg`).  This is less common in modern systems but should still be considered.
        *   **Case Manipulation:**  Using different casing (e.g., `malicious.PhP`) if the validation is case-sensitive.
        *   **Special Characters:**  Using unusual characters or encodings in the filename.
        *   **Content-Type Spoofing:** The attacker changes the Content-Type in the HTTP request header to match an allowed file type.

    *   **Gollum-Specific Considerations:**
        *   **Rack's Handling of `Content-Type`:**  Gollum relies on Rack for handling HTTP requests.  It's crucial to understand how Rack parses and validates the `Content-Type` header.  Vulnerabilities in Rack's handling could be exploited.
        *   **Gollum's Internal Validation:**  Gollum *should* have its own internal validation logic, independent of Rack, to verify file types.  This logic needs to be robust against the bypass techniques listed above.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust File Type Validation (Server-Side):**  Implement comprehensive server-side validation that:
            *   Uses a whitelist of allowed extensions.
            *   Checks the *entire* filename, not just the last extension.
            *   Is case-insensitive.
            *   Handles null bytes and special characters correctly.
            *   Validates the *actual file content*, not just the extension or MIME type.  Use libraries like `file` (on Unix-like systems) or language-specific libraries (e.g., Python's `mimetypes` module, but used *correctly* for validation, not just guessing).
        *   **Reject Files with Multiple Extensions:**  A simple but effective rule is to reject any file with multiple extensions.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize the filename to remove any potentially dangerous characters.
        *   **Regular Expressions (Carefully):**  If using regular expressions for validation, ensure they are carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path of insecure file uploads in Gollum presents a significant risk, primarily due to the potential for remote code execution. While Gollum's use of Git provides some inherent protection, it is *not* sufficient. The most critical factors are the web server configuration and the robustness of Gollum's file type validation.  Strict whitelisting of allowed file types, content-based validation, secure web server configuration (preventing execution of files within the repository), and secure storage practices are essential to mitigate this vulnerability.  Regular security audits and updates are also crucial. The development team should prioritize implementing these mitigations to ensure the security of Gollum installations.
