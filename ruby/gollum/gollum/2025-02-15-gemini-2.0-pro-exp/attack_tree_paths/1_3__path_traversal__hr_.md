# Deep Analysis of Gollum Attack Tree Path: Path Traversal

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability of Gollum to path traversal attacks, specifically focusing on how an attacker can manipulate file paths to access sensitive configuration files.  We aim to identify the specific mechanisms within Gollum that could be exploited, the potential impact of a successful attack, and, most importantly, concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to prevent such attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

1.  **Path Traversal [High Risk]**
    *   1.3.1.  **Manipulate file paths in requests:**  The attacker crafts malicious URLs or inputs.
    *   1.3.2.  **Access sensitive files (e.g., configuration) [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The scope includes:

*   **Gollum's core functionality related to file handling and URL processing.**  We'll examine how Gollum handles user-provided input that influences file paths, including page names, file uploads (if applicable), and any other relevant parameters.
*   **The Git backend interaction.**  Since Gollum uses Git, we need to understand how Git's file storage and access mechanisms interact with Gollum's request handling.  This includes considering how Gollum sanitizes or validates paths before interacting with the Git repository.
*   **The web server configuration (to a limited extent).** While the primary focus is on Gollum itself, we'll briefly consider how common web server configurations (e.g., Apache, Nginx) might exacerbate or mitigate the vulnerability.  We won't delve into detailed web server hardening, but we'll note relevant interactions.
*   **Typical deployment scenarios.** We'll assume a standard Gollum deployment, likely using a common web server and a local Git repository.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Other attack vectors against Gollum (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
*   General Git security best practices (e.g., securing SSH keys).
*   In-depth analysis of specific web server vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Gollum source code (available on GitHub) to identify:
    *   Functions responsible for handling file paths and URLs.
    *   Input validation and sanitization routines (or lack thereof).
    *   Interactions with the Git backend (e.g., calls to `git` commands).
    *   Any known vulnerabilities or past security advisories related to path traversal.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will set up a local Gollum instance and perform penetration testing to:
    *   Attempt to craft malicious URLs and inputs to trigger path traversal.
    *   Observe the application's behavior and error messages.
    *   Verify if we can access files outside the intended wiki directory.
    *   Test different encoding techniques (e.g., URL encoding, double encoding) to bypass potential filters.

3.  **Literature Review:**  We will research:
    *   Common path traversal vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
    *   Best practices for preventing path traversal in web applications.
    *   Security advisories and CVEs related to Gollum or similar Git-based wiki systems.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles and their motivations to understand the potential impact of a successful path traversal attack.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1.  1.3.1. Manipulate file paths in requests

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

Gollum, being a wiki system, heavily relies on user-provided input to determine which page to display or edit.  This input, typically in the form of a page name within the URL, directly influences the file path used to access the corresponding Git object (usually a file within the Git repository).  The core vulnerability lies in how Gollum handles this user-provided page name.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Path Traversal:**  An attacker might try to access a file outside the wiki directory by including `../` sequences in the page name.  For example:
    ```
    http://example.com/wiki/../../etc/passwd
    ```
    This attempts to navigate two levels up from the wiki's root directory and access the `/etc/passwd` file.

*   **Encoded Path Traversal:**  To bypass simple filtering, attackers might use URL encoding or double URL encoding:
    ```
    http://example.com/wiki/%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd  (URL encoded)
    http://example.com/wiki/%252E%252E%252F%252E%252E%252Fetc%252Fpasswd (Double URL encoded)
    ```

*   **Null Byte Injection:**  In some older systems (less likely with modern Ruby/Rack setups), a null byte (`%00`) could be used to terminate the file path prematurely, potentially bypassing checks:
    ```
    http://example.com/wiki/../../etc/passwd%00.html
    ```
    (The `.html` might be appended by Gollum, but the null byte could truncate it).

* **Upload Functionality (If Present):** If Gollum allows file uploads, the attacker might try to control the filename or upload path to place a malicious file in a sensitive location or overwrite an existing file.

* **Git Specific Vectors:** While less direct, an attacker with some knowledge of the Git repository structure might try to craft URLs that access specific Git objects (e.g., blobs, trees) directly, although this would likely require more sophisticated understanding of Gollum's internal workings.

**Code Review (Illustrative - Requires Actual Code Inspection):**

We would look for code similar to this (hypothetical, based on common patterns):

```ruby
# Hypothetical Gollum code (simplified)
def show_page(page_name)
  file_path = File.join(wiki_root, page_name) # Potential vulnerability here!
  if File.exist?(file_path)
    # ... read and display the file ...
  else
    # ... handle 404 ...
  end
end
```

The critical point is the `File.join(wiki_root, page_name)` line.  If `page_name` is not properly sanitized, it can contain `../` sequences, leading to path traversal.  A secure implementation would need to:

1.  **Normalize the path:**  Use a function like `File.expand_path` to resolve relative paths (`../`) *before* joining with the `wiki_root`.
2.  **Validate the path:**  After normalization, check if the resulting path is still within the `wiki_root` directory.  This is crucial.
3.  **Whitelist allowed characters:**  Restrict the allowed characters in `page_name` to a safe set (e.g., alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore).  This is a defense-in-depth measure.

### 4.2. 1.3.2. Access sensitive files (e.g., configuration) [CRITICAL]

**Impact Analysis:**

Successful path traversal allows the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, limited only by the permissions of the user running the Gollum process (and the web server).  This has severe consequences:

*   **Configuration File Disclosure:**  The most critical impact is the potential exposure of configuration files.  Gollum might have configuration files containing:
    *   Database credentials (if using a database-backed Git adapter).
    *   API keys for external services.
    *   Secret keys used for session management or other security-related functions.
    *   Sensitive application settings.

*   **Source Code Disclosure:**  The attacker might be able to read Gollum's source code, potentially revealing other vulnerabilities or sensitive logic.

*   **System Information Disclosure:**  Accessing files like `/etc/passwd`, `/proc/version`, or other system files can provide the attacker with valuable information about the server's operating system, users, and configuration, aiding in further attacks.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not the primary goal of path traversal, an attacker could potentially cause a DoS by accessing very large files or device files (e.g., `/dev/zero`), consuming server resources.

* **Data Modification/Deletion (Less Likely, but Possible):** If the Gollum process has write access to files outside the wiki directory (which it *should not*), the attacker could potentially modify or delete files, leading to data loss or system instability. This is highly dependent on the system's file permissions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The primary mitigation is to prevent path traversal in the first place (as described in 4.1).  However, additional layers of defense are crucial:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Gollum process with the *minimum* necessary permissions.  It should *never* run as root.  It should only have read access to the wiki directory (and write access if editing is enabled) and no access to sensitive system files.

*   **Chroot Jail (If Possible):**  Consider running Gollum within a chroot jail, which restricts its file system access to a specific directory, effectively preventing it from accessing anything outside that directory, even with path traversal.

*   **Web Server Configuration:**  Configure the web server (Apache, Nginx) to:
    *   Prevent directory listing.
    *   Restrict access to sensitive files and directories using `Location` or similar directives.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block path traversal attempts.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Keep Gollum and Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update Gollum and all its dependencies (Ruby, Rack, Git, etc.) to the latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to ensure that user-provided input does not contain malicious characters or sequences.

* **Safe File Handling Practices:** Use secure file handling functions and libraries that are designed to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Path traversal is a serious vulnerability that can have critical consequences for Gollum installations.  By carefully analyzing the attack tree path, we've identified the specific mechanisms that can be exploited, the potential impact, and, most importantly, concrete mitigation strategies.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Robust input validation and sanitization are paramount.**  Gollum must rigorously validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences file paths.
*   **The principle of least privilege is essential.**  The Gollum process should run with minimal permissions.
*   **Defense-in-depth is crucial.**  Multiple layers of security controls (application-level, web server-level, and system-level) should be implemented to mitigate the risk.
*   **Regular security audits and updates are necessary.**  Continuous monitoring and patching are vital to maintain a secure Gollum installation.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of path traversal attacks and protect sensitive data.
