# Threat Model Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed wiki page or sequence of requests that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, or disk I/O) *due to Gollum's processing of that input*. This could involve deeply nested markup, complex macros that Gollum must evaluate, or a high volume of requests that overwhelm Gollum's internal processing capabilities. The goal is to make the wiki unresponsive or unavailable. This differs from a general web server DoS; it's specifically about how Gollum handles input.
    *   **Impact:** Wiki becomes unavailable or extremely slow, disrupting normal operations. Potential for server instability.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:**
        *   `Gollum::Markup` (and related classes): The rendering engine responsible for processing wiki markup. Complex or malicious markup can cause excessive resource consumption *within Gollum*.
        *   `Gollum::Page` and `Gollum::File`: Handling of large files or numerous attachments *by Gollum*.
        *   Macro processing (if custom macros are used, and Gollum is responsible for their execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (within Gollum):** Gollum should validate and sanitize user input *before* processing it, especially in areas that trigger complex rendering or macro execution. Limit the length, depth, and complexity of markup and macro arguments.
        *   **Resource Limits (for Gollum processes):** Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) specifically for the Gollum process. This can be done at the OS level or, if possible, within the Ruby environment Gollum runs in.
        *   **Macro Security (within Gollum):** If custom macros are used, Gollum's macro handling should include:
            *   Thorough review and auditing of macro code.
            *   Strict input validation within the macro.
            *   Limiting macro capabilities (avoiding system calls, etc.).
            *   Potentially sandboxing macro execution (if feasible within the Ruby/Gollum environment).
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms (within Gollum):** Gollum should implement timeouts for long-running operations (markup rendering, macro execution) to prevent them from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   **Rate Limiting (specific to Gollum actions):** Implement rate limiting *within Gollum* to prevent users from submitting an excessive number of requests that trigger expensive operations (e.g., complex page renders, macro calls). This is distinct from general web server rate limiting.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File Upload/Access (Gollum's Handling)](./threats/unauthorized_file_uploadaccess__gollum's_handling_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized File Upload/Access (Gollum's Handling)

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file through Gollum's file upload functionality, or accesses existing attachments without authorization *due to flaws in Gollum's handling of file uploads and access control*. This is *not* about general web server misconfiguration, but about Gollum's specific code for managing files.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the server (if Gollum mishandles executable uploads), malware distribution to users, data breaches, and system compromise.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:**
        *   `Gollum::File`: The component responsible for handling file uploads, storage, and retrieval *within Gollum*.
        *   Any Gollum code that serves files or generates links to files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Type Whitelisting (within Gollum):** Gollum's code should strictly enforce a whitelist of allowed file types *before* storing the file.
        *   **File Content Validation (within Gollum):** Gollum should validate the *content* of uploaded files, not just the extension, using a reliable method (e.g., "magic numbers") *before* storing the file.
        *   **Secure Storage (Gollum's responsibility):** Gollum should be configured to store attachments in a location and with permissions that prevent direct web access. Gollum should be responsible for serving the files with appropriate access control.
        *   **Randomized File Names (generated by Gollum):** Gollum should use a secure random number generator to create file names, preventing predictable paths.
        *   **Access Control (within Gollum):** Gollum's code must implement and enforce access control for file downloads, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific files. This is *Gollum's* responsibility, not just the web server's.

## Threat: [Macro-Related Vulnerabilities](./threats/macro-related_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Macro-Related Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** If Gollum is configured to use custom macros, a poorly written or malicious macro *that Gollum executes* could introduce vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), or information disclosure. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a wiki page that uses the vulnerable macro, and Gollum would then execute the flawed code.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from XSS (allowing the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript) to RCE (allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server).
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:**
        *   Gollum's macro processing engine (the specific Ruby code that handles macro definition, parsing, and execution).
        *   Any Gollum components that interact with the output of macros.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Code Review (of Gollum's macro handling and the macros themselves):** Carefully review Gollum's macro implementation and *all* custom macro code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation (within Gollum and the macros):** Gollum's macro engine should validate input *to* the macros, and the macros themselves should rigorously validate any data they receive.
        *   **Output Encoding (by Gollum and the macros):** Gollum should ensure that macro output is properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Macros themselves should also encode their output.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (for macros):** Limit the capabilities of macros to the absolute minimum required. Avoid giving them access to system commands, sensitive data, or network resources *from within Gollum*.
        *   **Sandboxing (if feasible within Gollum/Ruby):** If possible within the Ruby environment and Gollum's architecture, consider executing macros in a sandboxed environment to limit their potential impact.
        *   **Regular Updates (of Gollum and macro libraries):** Keep Gollum and any libraries used by macros up to date to address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication/Authorization (if implemented *within* Gollum)](./threats/weak_authenticationauthorization__if_implemented_within_gollum_.md)

* **Threat:** Weak Authentication/Authorization (if implemented *within* Gollum)

    * **Description:** If Gollum has *its own* built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms (rather than relying entirely on an external system), weaknesses in these mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass them. This includes weak password handling, flawed authorization checks, or vulnerabilities in session management *within Gollum's code*.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to wiki content, potential for data modification or deletion, and escalation of privileges *within the wiki*.
    * **Affected Gollum Component:**
        * Gollum's authentication module (if it exists).
        * Gollum's authorization logic (the code that determines user permissions).
        * Session management code (if Gollum handles sessions directly).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Password Policies (enforced by Gollum):** If Gollum handles passwords, it must enforce strong password policies.
        * **Brute-Force Protection (within Gollum):** Gollum's authentication logic should include mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., account lockout).
        * **Proper Authorization Checks (within Gollum):** Gollum's code must implement and enforce correct authorization checks for *all* wiki operations.
        * **Secure Session Management (if handled by Gollum):** If Gollum manages sessions, it must do so securely (using secure cookies, proper session timeouts, etc.).
        * **Prefer External Authentication:** The *best* mitigation is often to *not* rely on Gollum's built-in authentication (if any). Instead, integrate with a robust, well-maintained external authentication system (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, SAML) and let *that* system handle authentication. Gollum would then only need to handle authorization based on the authenticated user's identity.
