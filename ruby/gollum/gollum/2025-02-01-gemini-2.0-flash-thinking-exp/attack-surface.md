# Attack Surface Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markup Parsing](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markup_parsing.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious users inject client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into wiki pages through crafted markup syntax. When other users view these pages, the scripts execute in their browsers.
*   **Gollum Contribution:** Gollum uses various markup parsers (Markdown, Creole, etc.) to render wiki content. Vulnerabilities in these parsers or Gollum's sanitization logic can allow malicious markup to be interpreted as executable code.
*   **Example:** A user creates a wiki page with Markdown containing: `[Click me!](javascript:alert('XSS'))`. When another user clicks the link, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` executes in their browser, demonstrating XSS. A more malicious example could involve stealing cookies or redirecting to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account compromise, defacement of wiki pages, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Gollum should rigorously sanitize all user-provided markup input before rendering it. Utilize robust HTML sanitization libraries specifically designed to prevent XSS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, significantly reducing the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
    *   **Regularly Update Gollum and Markup Parsers:** Keep Gollum and its dependencies, especially markup parser gems, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Choose Markup Language Carefully:**  Consider using a less feature-rich markup language if security is a primary concern, as simpler languages may have a smaller attack surface.
    *   **Disable or Restrict Unsafe Markup Features:** If possible, configure Gollum or the chosen parser to disable or restrict potentially unsafe markup features like inline JavaScript or iframes.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Markup](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_markup.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit markup features that allow embedding external resources (images, iframes, etc.) to make requests to internal or external servers from the Gollum server.
*   **Gollum Contribution:** Gollum's markup parsing capabilities, if not properly restricted, can allow users to embed URLs in wiki pages. If Gollum's server-side rendering process fetches these URLs without proper validation, it can be exploited for SSRF.
*   **Example:** A user creates a wiki page with Markdown containing: `![Internal Service](http://internal.network/admin)`. When Gollum renders this page, it might attempt to fetch the image from `http://internal.network/admin`, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on them if they are not properly secured.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems, denial of service against internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Implement strict whitelisting of allowed URL schemes and domains for embedded resources. Blacklist internal network ranges and sensitive external domains.
    *   **Disable External Resource Embedding (If possible):** If embedding external resources is not a core requirement, consider disabling this feature in Gollum's configuration or through parser settings.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize URLs provided in markup to ensure they conform to allowed patterns and do not point to internal or restricted resources.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Gollum server from sensitive internal networks if possible, limiting the potential impact of SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Git Repository Access Control Bypass](./attack_surfaces/git_repository_access_control_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Gollum's access control mechanisms could allow unauthorized users to bypass these controls and directly interact with the underlying Git repository.
*   **Gollum Contribution:** Gollum manages access to wiki content through its own access control mechanisms, which might have vulnerabilities or be misconfigured, especially in custom deployments or extensions.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Gollum's authentication or authorization logic could allow an unauthenticated user to gain write access to the Git repository, enabling them to modify wiki content or even the repository structure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of wiki content, information disclosure through access to Git history, potential repository corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly Review and Test Access Control Implementation:**  Carefully review and test Gollum's access control mechanisms, especially if custom authentication or authorization is implemented.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and modify wiki content.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in access control.
    *   **Secure Git Repository Hosting:** Ensure the underlying Git repository hosting platform is also securely configured and access-controlled.

## Attack Surface: [Markup Parser Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markup_parser_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Gollum relies on external markup parsers (like Redcarpet for Markdown). Vulnerabilities in these specific parser dependencies can be directly exploited through Gollum.
*   **Gollum Contribution:** Gollum's core functionality depends on these parsers to render user-provided content. Vulnerabilities in these parsers directly become vulnerabilities in Gollum.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the `redcarpet` gem (Markdown parser) that allows remote code execution when processing maliciously crafted Markdown. If Gollum uses this vulnerable version, attackers could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the Gollum server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server compromise, Data breach, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Dependency Management and Pinning:** Use a dependency management tool (like Bundler in Ruby) and pin specific versions of markup parser gems to ensure consistent and controlled updates.
    *   **Proactive Vulnerability Monitoring for Markup Parsers:**  Specifically monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for the markup parsers used by Gollum.
    *   **Rapid Patching and Updates:**  Have a process in place to quickly patch or update Gollum and its markup parser dependencies when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
    *   **Consider Alternative Parsers (with caution):** If a parser consistently shows vulnerabilities, consider switching to a more secure and actively maintained alternative, but ensure compatibility and thorough testing.
