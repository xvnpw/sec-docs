## Attack Tree Path: [Read Sensitive Configuration (e.g., secrets, API keys if improperly stored) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/read_sensitive_configuration__e_g___secrets__api_keys_if_improperly_stored___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Insecurely configured Gollum deployment where configuration files are readable by unauthorized users.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker gains access to configuration files (e.g., due to misconfigured file permissions) and reads sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets stored within.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further compromise of the application, backend systems, or external services.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict file permissions on configuration files, ensuring only the Gollum application user and administrators have read access.
    *   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Git Repository Access -> Gain Write Access -> Modify Wiki Content and potentially Application Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_git_repository_access_-_gain_write_access_-_modify_wiki_content_and_potentially_applic_63697e62.md)

**Attack Vector:** Weak access controls on the underlying Git repository used by Gollum.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker gains write access to the Git repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, misconfigured Git server permissions, or social engineering). They can then directly modify wiki content by pushing changes. If wiki content influences application logic (less common in core Gollum, but possible in integrations), this can lead to application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Wiki defacement, misinformation, data manipulation, and potentially application compromise if wiki content is used for other purposes.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strong access controls on the Git repository, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit Git repository permissions.
    *   Consider read-only Gollum deployments if editing is not required.

**Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in Gollum's markup parsing that allow injection of malicious scripts into wiki pages.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a wiki page (e.g., via Markdown). This script is stored in the wiki and executed in the browsers of other users who view the page (Stored XSS). The script can steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's session.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, further attacks leveraging compromised accounts.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Robust input sanitization and output encoding of user-provided markup.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and control resource loading sources.
    *   Regular security testing focused on XSS vulnerabilities in markup parsing.
    *   Keep Gollum and dependencies updated to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Redirect Users to Malicious Sites [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_redirect_users_to_malicious_sites__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in custom formatters or extensions (less likely in core Gollum) that allow an attacker to control server-side requests made by Gollum.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker crafts malicious markup that, when processed by a vulnerable formatter/extension, causes Gollum to make requests to internal resources (e.g., internal network services, databases, cloud metadata APIs).
*   **Impact:** Access to internal systems and data, potential data breaches, information gathering about the internal network.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully review and secure custom formatters and extensions.
    *   Restrict outbound network access from the Gollum server to only necessary external resources.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization in custom formatters to prevent manipulation of request URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection -> Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_-_gain_remote_code_execution__rce__on_server__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Highly unlikely in core Gollum, but possible in severely vulnerable custom formatters or extensions that execute shell commands based on user-controlled markup input.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker injects malicious markup that, when processed by a vulnerable formatter/extension, results in the execution of arbitrary shell commands on the Gollum server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, complete control over the Gollum application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid executing shell commands based on user input in custom formatters or extensions.
    *   If shell command execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.

**Attack Vector:** Very unlikely in typical Gollum setup and Git permissions, but theoretically possible if there's a vulnerability allowing writing to arbitrary file paths via Git commands.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability in Git command execution (highly improbable in standard Git usage) to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, ability to overwrite system files, introduce backdoors, or disrupt system operations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure Git commands are executed securely and do not allow path traversal.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions to limit write access for the Gollum application user.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Ruby Gems -> Gain RCE via vulnerable gem [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_ruby_gems_-_gain_rce_via_vulnerable_gem__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using outdated Ruby gems with known security vulnerabilities that allow Remote Code Execution.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies a vulnerable Ruby gem used by Gollum and exploits a known vulnerability (often publicly disclosed) to execute arbitrary code on the server.

*   **Exploitation:** Attacker floods the Gollum application with excessive requests, overwhelming server resources and causing service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, wiki unavailability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting for critical operations to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
    *   Use web application firewalls (WAFs) or load balancers to mitigate DoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Security Headers -> XSS exploitation via missing headers [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_security_headers_-_xss_exploitation_via_missing_headers__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Missing security headers in the HTTP response from the Gollum application.
*   **Exploitation:** Lack of security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` makes it easier for attackers to exploit XSS vulnerabilities. For example, missing `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` might allow reflected XSS attacks that would otherwise be blocked by the browser's built-in XSS filter (though this header is deprecated, CSP is the modern solution). Missing CSP is a significant weakening of XSS defenses.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to XSS attacks, potentially leading to account compromise and other XSS-related impacts.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure the web server hosting Gollum to send essential security headers, including `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy`.
