# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Markdown Parsing and HTML Sanitization (Gollum Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_markdown_parsing_and_html_sanitization__gollum_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Gollum's Markdown Parser Configuration:** Gollum uses a Markdown parser (by default `kramdown`). Examine Gollum's configuration options related to Markdown parsing.  Specifically look for settings that control:
        *   **HTML Rendering:**  Check if there are options to disable or restrict raw HTML embedding within Markdown.
        *   **Safe Mode/Strict Mode:**  See if the parser offers a "safe mode" or "strict mode" that limits potentially dangerous features.
    2.  **Configure `kramdown` (or Chosen Parser) for Security:** If using `kramdown`, explore its configuration options to enhance security. This might involve:
        *   **Disabling HTML in Markdown:**  If possible and functionality allows, disable the parsing of raw HTML within Markdown content altogether.
        *   **Restricting HTML Tags and Attributes:** If raw HTML cannot be fully disabled, configure `kramdown` (or use a separate HTML sanitizer *after* `kramdown` parsing but *before* rendering) to allow only a very limited and safe set of HTML tags and attributes. Blacklist potentially dangerous elements like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and event attributes.
    3.  **Regularly Update Gollum and `kramdown` Gems:** Keep Gollum and its `kramdown` (or the Markdown parser gem you are using) dependencies updated to the latest versions. Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases. Use `bundle update gollum kramdown` (or similar for your dependency manager).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown - High Severity:**  Malicious users could inject JavaScript code into wiki pages by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Markdown parser's handling of HTML or by using allowed HTML features in Markdown to inject malicious scripts. This mitigation directly reduces this risk by controlling how Gollum parses and renders Markdown.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown: Significantly Reduced.** By configuring Gollum's Markdown parser for strictness and potentially sanitizing HTML output, the risk of XSS attacks originating from crafted Markdown content is substantially lowered.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Markdown Parser:** Using `kramdown` gem, which is default in Gollum.
    *   **Configuration:** Gollum is likely using default `kramdown` configuration. No explicit security hardening of Markdown parsing is configured beyond defaults.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Gollum Configuration Review:** Need to explicitly review Gollum's configuration files or settings to identify options for Markdown parser configuration.
    *   **`kramdown` Hardening:**  Explore `kramdown` documentation to find security-related configuration options and implement them in Gollum's setup.
    *   **Potential HTML Sanitizer Integration (Post-Parsing):** If `kramdown` configuration is insufficient, consider adding a separate HTML sanitizer step after `kramdown` parsing but before rendering the HTML output in Gollum.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Gollum's Authentication and Authorization Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/gollum's_authentication_and_authorization_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Gollum's Authentication Options:** Gollum might offer built-in authentication mechanisms or support integration with external authentication systems. Examine Gollum's documentation and configuration files to understand the available authentication options.
    2.  **Configure Strong Authentication for Gollum:**
        *   **If using built-in Gollum Authentication:** Ensure it is configured securely. Enforce strong password policies if applicable. Consider if built-in authentication is sufficient for your security needs.
        *   **Integrate with External Authentication (Recommended):** If Gollum supports it, integrate with a more robust external authentication system like:
            *   LDAP/Active Directory (if your organization uses it)
            *   OAuth 2.0 providers (if appropriate for your user base)
            *   SAML (for enterprise environments)
        *   **Disable Anonymous Access (If Necessary):** If your wiki should not be publicly accessible, ensure anonymous access is disabled in Gollum's configuration.
    3.  **Implement Gollum's Authorization/Permissions (If Available):** Check if Gollum provides any built-in mechanisms for authorization or access control (e.g., page-level permissions, user roles). If so, configure these to restrict access to sensitive wiki content based on user roles or permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Wiki Content - High Severity:** If authentication is weak or misconfigured, unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive wiki pages, potentially viewing confidential information or modifying content they shouldn't.
    *   **Unauthorized Modification of Wiki Content - Medium to High Severity:**  Without proper authorization, users might be able to edit or delete wiki pages without appropriate permissions, leading to data integrity issues or vandalism.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access: Significantly Reduced.** Strong authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized users from accessing the Gollum application.
    *   **Unauthorized Modification: Partially to Significantly Reduced.** Authorization controls within Gollum (if implemented) can restrict editing and modification rights to authorized users, depending on the granularity of the authorization system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Authentication:**  Likely using default Gollum authentication (if enabled) or potentially no authentication if publicly accessible. Current authentication method needs to be verified.
    *   **Authorization:**  Authorization mechanisms within Gollum (beyond basic edit permissions) are likely not configured or used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Authentication Configuration Review:**  Review Gollum's authentication configuration and determine the current method in use.
    *   **Stronger Authentication Integration:**  Explore integrating Gollum with a more robust authentication system (LDAP, OAuth, SAML) if appropriate.
    *   **Authorization Implementation:** Investigate if Gollum or plugins offer authorization features and implement role-based access control or page-level permissions if needed.
    *   **Access Control Testing:** Thoroughly test the configured authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure they are working as expected.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Gollum Dependency Management and Updates (Gem Updates)](./mitigation_strategies/gollum_dependency_management_and_updates__gem_updates_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Update Gollum Gem:**  Keep the `gollum` Ruby gem updated to the latest stable version. Use `bundle update gollum` (or your Ruby dependency management tool) to update.
    2.  **Update Gollum's Dependencies (Gems):** Gollum relies on other Ruby gems (like `kramdown`, `rugged`, etc.). Regularly update *all* of Gollum's dependencies to their latest versions. Use `bundle update` to update all gems in your `Gemfile`.
    3.  **Monitor for Gollum and Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability scanning tools (like `bundler-audit`) to monitor for reported security vulnerabilities in Gollum and its dependencies.
    4.  **Promptly Apply Security Updates:** When security vulnerabilities are announced for Gollum or its dependencies, prioritize applying the updates as quickly as possible to patch the vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Gollum or Dependencies - High Severity:** Gollum and its dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, RCE, arbitrary code execution). Outdated versions are more likely to have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Keeping dependencies updated mitigates these risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Gollum/Dependencies: Significantly Reduced.** Regularly updating Gollum and its dependencies ensures that known security vulnerabilities are patched, significantly reducing the attack surface and the risk of exploitation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Dependency Updates:**  Likely no regular, automated process for updating Gollum and its dependencies. Updates might be done manually and infrequently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Update Process:** Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying updates to Gollum and its dependencies. This could involve:
        *   **Scheduled Dependency Checks:**  Set up automated checks for outdated gems using tools like `bundler-audit` or similar.
        *   **Automated Update Pipeline:**  Ideally, integrate dependency updates into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure updates are tested and deployed regularly.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Establish a system for monitoring security advisories related to Gollum and its dependencies.
