### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions/Formatters -> Gain Control via Custom Code Exploitation

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions or Formatters

Gollum's extensibility is a powerful feature, allowing users to tailor the wiki to their specific needs through custom extensions and formatters. However, this flexibility introduces a significant security consideration.  Custom code, by its nature, is outside the direct security scrutiny of the core Gollum development team. This increases the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities if developers lack sufficient security expertise or fail to adhere to secure coding practices.

**Key Aspects of the Attack Vector:**

*   **Custom Code Nature:**  Extensions and formatters are developed by users or third-party developers, potentially with varying levels of security awareness and expertise.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:**  Adding custom code expands the application's codebase and introduces new functionalities, potentially creating new entry points for attackers.
*   **Trust Assumption:**  Gollum relies on the assumption that custom extensions are developed securely. If this assumption is violated, it creates a significant vulnerability.
*   **Complexity:**  Complex extensions with intricate logic are more prone to vulnerabilities than simple ones.

#### 4.2. Exploitation: Gain Control via Custom Code Exploitation

If custom extensions or formatters are not developed with security in mind, they can introduce various vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain control over the Gollum application and potentially the underlying server.  The most common and critical vulnerability types in this context include:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** If custom formatters process user-supplied content without proper sanitization and output encoding, they can inject malicious JavaScript code into wiki pages.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can craft malicious wiki pages or content that, when rendered by a vulnerable formatter, executes JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, account takeover, defacement of wiki pages, redirection to malicious websites, and phishing attacks targeting wiki users.

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   **Mechanism:**  If custom extensions interact with the operating system, execute external commands, or process user input in an unsafe manner (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection), vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can craft malicious input or requests that, when processed by a vulnerable extension, result in the execution of attacker-controlled code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** RCE is the most critical vulnerability. It grants attackers complete control over the Gollum server, allowing them to:
        *   Steal sensitive data (wiki content, server configuration, credentials).
        *   Modify or delete wiki content.
        *   Install malware or backdoors.
        *   Use the server as a launchpad for further attacks on internal networks or external systems.
        *   Cause a denial of service.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    *   **Mechanism:** If custom extensions make outbound network requests based on user-controlled data without proper validation and sanitization of the target URL, attackers can force the server to make requests to unintended destinations.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can manipulate user input to cause the Gollum server to make requests to internal resources (e.g., internal services, databases) or external systems.
    *   **Impact:** SSRF can lead to:
        *   Access to internal resources that are not directly accessible from the internet.
        *   Information disclosure of internal network configurations and services.
        *   Bypassing firewalls and access controls.
        *   Potentially chaining with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or gain further access.

*   **Other Vulnerabilities:** Depending on the specific functionality of the custom extension, other vulnerabilities may also be introduced, including:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If extensions interact with databases without proper parameterized queries or ORM usage.
    *   **Path Traversal:** If extensions handle file paths based on user input without proper validation, allowing access to unauthorized files.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** If extensions deserialize data from untrusted sources without proper validation, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** If custom authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented incorrectly.

#### 4.3. Impact: Ranging from XSS to Full Server Compromise

The impact of successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in custom extensions and formatters varies significantly depending on the type and severity of the vulnerability:

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    *   **Impact Level:** Low to Medium. Primarily client-side impact.
    *   **Consequences:** User account compromise, data theft (cookies, session tokens), wiki defacement, phishing attacks targeting wiki users, reduced user trust.

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**
    *   **Impact Level:** Medium to High. Server-side impact, potential for internal network exposure.
    *   **Consequences:** Exposure of internal network infrastructure, access to internal services and data, potential data breaches, bypassing security controls, potential for further exploitation.

*   **RCE (Remote Code Execution):**
    *   **Impact Level:** Critical. Server-side impact, complete system compromise.
    *   **Consequences:** Full control over the Gollum server, data breaches (wiki content, server configuration, credentials), data manipulation or deletion, malware installation, denial of service, use of compromised server for further attacks, severe reputational damage.

**Overall Impact:**  The "Gain Control via Custom Code Exploitation" path is considered **HIGH RISK** because it can potentially lead to **CRITICAL** impact, especially in the case of RCE vulnerabilities.  A successful attack can compromise the entire Gollum wiki and the server it runs on, leading to significant security breaches and operational disruptions.

#### 4.4. Mitigation: Secure Development, Testing, and Maintenance

To effectively mitigate the risks associated with vulnerabilities in custom extensions and formatters, a multi-layered approach is required, focusing on secure development practices, thorough security testing, and ongoing maintenance:

**4.4.1. Secure Coding Practices During Development:**
