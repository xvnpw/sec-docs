### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) -> Access Internal Resources [HIGH RISK PATH]

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the SSRF attack path, focusing on each stage from attack vector to mitigation.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters or Extensions

**Explanation:**

Gollum, being a wiki system, allows users to create and edit content using various markup formats (Markdown, Textile, etc.). While core Gollum formatters are generally well-maintained, the extensibility of Gollum through custom formatters and extensions introduces a potential attack surface.

*   **Custom Formatters:** Gollum allows developers to create custom formatters to support new markup languages or extend existing ones. These formatters are responsible for parsing user-provided markup and converting it into HTML for display. If a custom formatter is poorly written and doesn't properly sanitize or validate user input, it can become vulnerable to SSRF.
*   **Extensions:** Gollum extensions can add various functionalities to the wiki, potentially including features that involve making network requests. If an extension processes user input and uses it to construct URLs or network requests without proper validation, it can be exploited for SSRF.

**Why Custom Components are Higher Risk:**

*   **Less Rigorous Security Review:** Custom formatters and extensions are often developed by individual users or smaller teams, and may not undergo the same level of security scrutiny as the core Gollum codebase.
*   **Complexity and Feature Creep:** Custom components might introduce complex logic and features, increasing the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities, including SSRF.
*   **Lack of Awareness:** Developers of custom components might not be fully aware of SSRF risks or best practices for preventing them.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a custom formatter designed to embed external content based on a URL provided in the markup.  If this formatter directly uses the provided URL to make a request without validation, an attacker can inject a URL pointing to an internal resource.

```markup
[[custom-embed url="http://internal.example.com/admin/sensitive-data"]]
```

If the custom formatter naively processes this markup, Gollum server will make a request to `http://internal.example.com/admin/sensitive-data` from its own network context.

#### 4.2. Exploitation: Attacker Crafts Malicious Markup

**Explanation:**

The exploitation phase involves an attacker crafting malicious markup within a Gollum page. This markup is designed to be processed by a vulnerable custom formatter or extension in a way that triggers an SSRF attack.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Formatter/Extension:** The attacker needs to identify a custom formatter or extension that is susceptible to SSRF. This might involve:
    *   **Publicly Known Vulnerabilities:** Checking for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific Gollum extensions or common patterns in custom formatters.
    *   **Code Analysis (if possible):** If the source code of custom components is available, the attacker can analyze it for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   **Trial and Error (Black-box testing):**  Experimenting with different markup inputs to observe if the Gollum server makes unexpected outbound requests. This could involve using network monitoring tools or observing server logs.

2.  **Craft Malicious Markup:** Once a vulnerable component is identified, the attacker crafts malicious markup that exploits the vulnerability. This markup will typically involve:
    *   **Injecting a URL:**  The attacker injects a URL into the markup that will be processed by the vulnerable formatter/extension. This URL will point to the internal resource the attacker wants to access.
    *   **URL Encoding/Obfuscation (if necessary):**  If the formatter/extension performs basic input validation, the attacker might use URL encoding or other obfuscation techniques to bypass these checks.
    *   **Exploiting URL Parameters:**  The attacker might manipulate URL parameters to target specific internal resources or actions.

**Example Malicious Markup (Continuing from previous example):**

```markup
[[custom-embed url="http://127.0.0.1:6379/info"]]  // Access local Redis instance (if running)
[[custom-embed url="http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/"]] // Access Google Cloud Metadata API (if running in GCP)
[[custom-embed url="file:///etc/passwd"]] // Attempt to read local files (depending on formatter capabilities and server configuration)
```

When Gollum processes a page containing this malicious markup, the vulnerable custom formatter/extension will make a server-side request to the attacker-controlled URL.

#### 4.3. Impact: Access to Internal Systems and Data

**Explanation:**

A successful SSRF attack, especially one targeting internal resources, can have significant and damaging impacts.

**Potential Impacts:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Internal Systems:**
    *   **Internal Web Applications:** Access to internal admin panels, monitoring dashboards, or other web-based applications that are not intended to be publicly accessible.
    *   **Databases:**  If internal databases are accessible via HTTP or other protocols, SSRF can be used to query or even modify data.
    *   **Cloud Metadata APIs:** In cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure), SSRF can be used to access metadata APIs, potentially revealing sensitive information like API keys, instance roles, and other configuration details.
    *   **Internal Network Services:** Access to other internal services like message queues, caching systems (Redis, Memcached), or internal APIs.

*   **Data Breaches:** Accessing internal systems can lead to the exposure and exfiltration of sensitive data, including customer data, internal documents, credentials, and intellectual property.

*   **Information Gathering about Internal Network:** Even without directly accessing sensitive data, SSRF can be used for reconnaissance to map the internal network, identify running services, and gather information that can be used for further attacks.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, SSRF can be used to overload internal services or trigger resource exhaustion, leading to denial of service.

**Risk Level:**

The "Access Internal Resources" SSRF path is considered **HIGH RISK** because it directly leads to potential compromise of internal systems and data, which can have severe consequences for the organization.

#### 4.4. Mitigation: Securing Custom Formatters and Extensions

**Explanation:**

Mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities in Gollum, especially those arising from custom formatters and extensions, requires a multi-layered approach focusing on prevention, detection, and response.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Carefully Review and Secure Custom Formatters and Extensions:**
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of all custom formatters and extensions before deployment. Focus specifically on how they handle user input and make network requests.
    *   **Secure Development Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom components, including input validation, output encoding, and least privilege principles.
    *   **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep custom formatters and extensions up-to-date with security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate if the functionality provided by custom components can be achieved through safer means or by leveraging core Gollum features.

2.  **Restrict Outbound Network Access from the Gollum Server:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Gollum server in a network segment with restricted outbound access.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to limit outbound connections from the Gollum server to only necessary external resources (e.g., specific whitelisted domains or IP ranges). Deny all other outbound traffic by default.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF that can inspect outbound requests from the Gollum application and block suspicious or malicious requests.

3.  **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Custom Formatters:**
    *   **URL Validation:**  Strictly validate URLs provided in user input. Use allowlists of permitted protocols (e.g., `https://`, `http://` for external resources, and potentially `data:` for inline data if necessary and carefully controlled).  **Never allow `file://` protocol unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
    *   **Hostname/Domain Whitelisting:** If the formatter needs to access external resources, implement a strict whitelist of allowed hostnames or domains.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or sequences that could be used to manipulate URLs or other parameters.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic URL Construction:** Minimize or eliminate the dynamic construction of URLs based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized queries or templating engines with proper escaping to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Restrict Server Permissions:** Run the Gollum server process with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Limit Access to Internal Resources:**  Ensure that the Gollum server's service account has minimal access to internal resources.

5.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Log Outbound Requests:**  Log all outbound requests made by the Gollum application, including the destination URL and originating user (if possible).
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement monitoring and anomaly detection systems to identify unusual outbound network traffic patterns that might indicate SSRF attacks.
    *   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for suspicious outbound requests or access attempts to internal resources.

**Conclusion:**

The SSRF attack path targeting internal resources through vulnerabilities in custom Gollum formatters and extensions represents a significant security risk. By understanding the attack vector, exploitation techniques, and potential impact, and by implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development and security teams can effectively reduce the likelihood and severity of SSRF attacks against their Gollum wiki application.  Prioritizing secure development practices for custom components and implementing robust network security controls are crucial for protecting sensitive internal resources.
