### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Repository Manipulation via Direct Git Access -> Introduce Backdoors into Wiki Data

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Gaining Direct Git Write Access

The initial step in this attack path is for an attacker to gain direct write access to the Git repository that underpins the Gollum wiki. This access bypasses the intended user interface and control mechanisms of Gollum itself.  Potential scenarios for achieving this include:

*   **Compromised Git Credentials:**
    *   **Stolen Credentials:** Attackers could obtain valid Git credentials (usernames and passwords, SSH keys, API tokens) through phishing, malware, or data breaches.
    *   **Weak Credentials:**  Users might employ weak or default passwords that are easily guessable or brute-forceable.
    *   **Credential Reuse:**  Users might reuse credentials across multiple services, making them vulnerable if one service is compromised.
*   **Insider Threat:**
    *   **Malicious Insider:** A disgruntled or compromised employee or contractor with legitimate Git access could intentionally introduce backdoors.
    *   **Negligent Insider:**  Unintentional misconfigurations or actions by users with Git access could create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Misconfigured Git Permissions:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Access Control:**  Git repositories might be configured with overly broad write permissions, granting access to unauthorized users or groups.
    *   **Publicly Accessible Repository (Accidental):** In rare cases, a private Git repository might be unintentionally exposed publicly due to misconfiguration, allowing unauthorized write access.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Git Hosting Platform:**
    *   Exploiting security vulnerabilities in the Git hosting platform (e.g., GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or self-hosted Git servers) to gain unauthorized access. This is less likely but still a potential vector.
*   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   If the CI/CD pipeline has write access to the Git repository, compromising the pipeline could grant attackers indirect write access.

#### 4.2. Exploitation: Introducing Backdoors into Wiki Data

Once an attacker has direct Git write access, they can manipulate the wiki data in various ways to introduce backdoors. The effectiveness and subtlety of these backdoors depend on the application logic that relies on the wiki data.

*   **Malicious Code Injection in Wiki Pages:**
    *   **JavaScript Injection:**  If Gollum or applications consuming wiki data render wiki content as HTML, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code within Markdown or HTML pages. This code could:
        *   **Steal User Credentials:** Capture user input, cookies, or session tokens.
        *   **Redirect Users to Malicious Sites:**  Phishing or malware distribution.
        *   **Perform Actions on Behalf of Users:**  Modify data, trigger application functions.
        *   **Establish Persistent Backdoors:**  Load external scripts or create web shells.
    *   **HTML Injection:**  Injecting malicious HTML tags (e.g., `<iframe>`, `<script>`, `<link>`) to embed external content or execute scripts.
    *   **Server-Side Template Injection (Less Likely in Gollum Directly, but possible in consuming applications):** If wiki content is processed by a server-side templating engine in applications consuming the wiki data, attackers might attempt to inject malicious template code.
*   **Data Manipulation for Application Logic Exploitation:**
    *   **Modifying Configuration Data:** If the wiki stores configuration data used by other applications (e.g., feature flags, access control lists, API endpoints), attackers can manipulate this data to:
        *   **Grant Unauthorized Access:**  Elevate privileges or bypass access controls.
        *   **Disable Security Features:**  Turn off security mechanisms or logging.
        *   **Redirect Application Flow:**  Change application behavior to their advantage.
    *   **Introducing Malicious Data Payloads:**  If applications parse and process wiki content as structured data (e.g., JSON, YAML embedded in wiki pages), attackers can inject malicious payloads that:
        *   **Trigger Vulnerabilities in Parsing Logic:**  Exploit buffer overflows, injection flaws, or other parsing errors.
        *   **Manipulate Application State:**  Alter data used in application calculations or decision-making processes.
    *   **Subtle Content Modification for Social Engineering:**
        *   **Phishing Links:**  Injecting inconspicuous phishing links within wiki content to trick users into revealing credentials or sensitive information.
        *   **Misinformation and Propaganda:**  Subtly altering wiki content to spread misinformation or manipulate user perception.
*   **Backdoor via Git Hooks (Less Direct Wiki Data Manipulation, but related to Git Access):**
    *   While not directly modifying wiki *content*, attackers with Git write access could modify Git hooks (e.g., `pre-receive`, `post-receive`) to execute malicious scripts on the server when changes are pushed. This could be used to establish a backdoor at the server level, even if the wiki content itself appears benign.

**Key Considerations for Exploitation:**

*   **Subtlety:** Attackers will likely aim for subtle modifications that are difficult to detect during casual review but are effective for their malicious purposes.
*   **Persistence:** Backdoors introduced via Git are persistent as they are stored within the repository's history.
*   **Context is Crucial:** The effectiveness of backdoors depends heavily on how the wiki data is used by Gollum and any other applications consuming it.

#### 4.3. Impact: Persistent Backdoors, Application Compromise, Data Breaches

The impact of successfully introducing backdoors via direct Git access can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Persistent Backdoors:**  Backdoors injected into the Git repository are persistent and can remain undetected for extended periods, allowing attackers to maintain long-term access and control.
*   **Application Compromise:**
    *   **Gollum Wiki Compromise:**  The Gollum wiki itself can be compromised, leading to:
        *   **Data Breaches:**  Exposure or theft of wiki content, including potentially sensitive information.
        *   **Defacement:**  Altering wiki content for malicious purposes or reputational damage.
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting wiki availability or performance.
    *   **Compromise of Applications Relying on Wiki Data:** If other applications consume or process wiki data, backdoors can propagate to these systems, leading to broader compromise. This is a critical concern if the wiki is used for configuration, documentation, or data sharing across systems.
*   **Data Breaches:**  Compromised applications can be used to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the wiki or in connected systems.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Backdoors can be used to escalate privileges within the Gollum application or related systems, granting attackers administrative control.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised systems can be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems within the organization's network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (Indirect):** If the wiki data is used in software development or deployment processes, backdoors could potentially be introduced into the software supply chain, affecting downstream users.

#### 4.4. Mitigation: Strengthening Defenses Against Repository Manipulation

To mitigate the risk of backdoors introduced via direct Git access, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

*   **Strict Access Control and Monitoring of Git Repository Access:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Git write access only to users and systems that absolutely require it. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage Git permissions based on roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all Git accounts with write access to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise.
    *   **Strong Password Policies:**  Implement and enforce strong password policies for Git accounts.
    *   **SSH Key Management:**  Prefer SSH keys over passwords for authentication and implement secure SSH key management practices.
    *   **API Token Security:**  If API tokens are used for Git access, ensure they are securely generated, stored, and rotated.
    *   **Audit Logging and Monitoring:**  Enable comprehensive audit logging of all Git repository access and modifications. Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities, such as:
        *   Unusual access patterns.
        *   Modifications to sensitive files or branches.
        *   Changes made outside of normal working hours.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Consider deploying IDS/IPS solutions to monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of unauthorized Git access attempts.
*   **Code Review and Security Audits of Application Logic Relying on Wiki Data:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Train developers on secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in applications that consume wiki data.
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Use SAST tools to automatically analyze application code for potential vulnerabilities related to wiki data processing.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Employ DAST tools to test running applications for vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks, including those targeting wiki data manipulation.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses in the application's security posture, including its handling of wiki data.
    *   **Regular Security Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for any changes to application logic that processes wiki data, focusing on security aspects.
*   **Content Integrity Monitoring:**
    *   **Version Control and Diffing:**  Leverage Git's version control capabilities to track all changes to wiki content. Regularly review diffs to identify unexpected or suspicious modifications.
    *   **Content Hashing:**  Implement mechanisms to generate and store cryptographic hashes of wiki content. Periodically verify these hashes to detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Automated Content Integrity Checks:**  Develop automated scripts or tools to regularly scan wiki content for known malicious patterns or anomalies.
    *   **Content Security Policies (CSP):**  If wiki content is rendered in web browsers, implement CSP headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the loading of external resources, mitigating the impact of JavaScript injection.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  If wiki data is used as input to other applications, implement robust input validation to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
    *   **Output Sanitization/Encoding:**  When rendering wiki content or using it in other contexts, properly sanitize or encode output to prevent injection attacks (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript encoding).
*   **Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments:**
    *   Conduct periodic security audits of the entire Gollum wiki infrastructure, including Git repository access controls, application security, and data handling practices.
    *   Perform regular vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses in the system.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to handle security breaches, including scenarios involving wiki data compromise.
    *   Regularly test and update the incident response plan.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**
    *   Provide security awareness training to all users with Git access, emphasizing the risks of credential compromise, insider threats, and the importance of secure Git practices.
