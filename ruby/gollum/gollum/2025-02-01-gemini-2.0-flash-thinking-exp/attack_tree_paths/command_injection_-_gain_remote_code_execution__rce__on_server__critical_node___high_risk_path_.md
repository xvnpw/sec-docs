#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Vulnerable Custom Formatters or Extensions

**Description:**

The core Gollum application is generally considered secure against direct command injection vulnerabilities. However, the extensibility of Gollum through custom formatters and extensions introduces potential attack vectors.  These components, if not developed with robust security practices, can become susceptible to command injection.

**Explanation:**

*   **Gollum Extensibility:** Gollum allows developers to create custom formatters to support various markup languages beyond the default (e.g., Markdown, Textile, etc.) and extensions to add functionalities. These custom components are executed within the Gollum application context.
*   **User-Controlled Markup Input:**  Gollum's primary function is to process user-provided markup text and render it as web pages. This user input is parsed and processed by the selected formatter.
*   **Vulnerable Code Execution:** If a custom formatter or extension is designed in a way that it executes shell commands based on user-controlled parts of the markup input *without proper sanitization*, it creates a command injection vulnerability.  This is particularly risky if the formatter attempts to dynamically construct shell commands using user-provided strings.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a hypothetical custom formatter designed to embed external files into the wiki page using a tag like `[include file="<user_provided_path>"]`. If the formatter directly uses the `<user_provided_path>` value in a shell command without validation, an attacker could inject malicious commands instead of a file path.

For instance, instead of `[include file="documents/report.txt"]`, an attacker could inject:

`[include file="documents/report.txt; rm -rf /tmp/* #"]`

If the vulnerable formatter executes a command like `cat <user_provided_path>`, the injected payload would become:

`cat documents/report.txt; rm -rf /tmp/* #`

This would first attempt to display `report.txt` (potentially harmless) but then execute `rm -rf /tmp/*`, deleting files in the `/tmp` directory on the server. The `#` symbol is used to comment out any subsequent parts of the intended command, preventing errors.

#### 4.2. Exploitation: Injecting Malicious Markup for Command Execution

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Gollum Instance:** The attacker first identifies a Gollum instance that potentially utilizes custom formatters or extensions. This might involve reconnaissance techniques like:
    *   Examining the Gollum configuration or documentation if publicly available.
    *   Analyzing error messages or server responses that might reveal used extensions.
    *   Trial and error by injecting different markup patterns and observing the application's behavior.

2.  **Identify Vulnerable Parameter/Markup:**  The attacker needs to pinpoint the specific markup element or parameter within a custom formatter/extension that is vulnerable to command injection. This often involves:
    *   Analyzing the functionality of custom formatters/extensions (if documentation or source code is available).
    *   Fuzzing input fields with various command injection payloads.
    *   Observing how the application processes different markup inputs.

3.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** Once the vulnerable parameter is identified, the attacker crafts a malicious markup payload. This payload will contain shell commands embedded within the expected markup structure, designed to be executed by the vulnerable formatter/extension.  Payloads can be tailored to the target operating system (Linux/Windows) and desired outcome. Common techniques include:
    *   **Command Chaining:** Using operators like `;`, `&&`, `||` to execute multiple commands sequentially.
    *   **Command Substitution:** Using backticks `` ` `` or `$(...)` to execute commands and embed their output.
    *   **Redirection:** Using `>`, `>>`, `<` to redirect input and output of commands.

4.  **Inject Payload into Gollum:** The attacker injects the crafted malicious markup payload into the Gollum wiki. This can be done through various means:
    *   **Editing an existing wiki page:** Modifying the content of a page accessible to the attacker.
    *   **Creating a new wiki page:** Creating a new page with the malicious markup.
    *   **User input fields:**  If the vulnerable formatter processes user input from other fields (e.g., comments, search queries - less likely but possible).

5.  **Trigger Payload Processing:** The attacker triggers the processing of the malicious markup. This typically happens when:
    *   The wiki page containing the malicious markup is rendered and displayed to a user (including the attacker).
    *   The Gollum application processes the markup in the background (e.g., during preview or indexing).

6.  **Command Execution and RCE:** When the vulnerable formatter/extension processes the malicious markup, it executes the embedded shell commands on the Gollum server. This grants the attacker Remote Code Execution (RCE).

#### 4.3. Impact: Full Server Compromise and System Control

**Severity:** **CRITICAL**

**Impact Details:**

Successful command injection leading to RCE has devastating consequences, potentially resulting in full server compromise and complete control over the Gollum application and the underlying system. The impact can include:

*   **Complete System Takeover:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Gollum application process. This often translates to the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `nginx`, `apache`).  From there, privilege escalation to root may be possible depending on system configurations and vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:** Access to all data stored within the Gollum wiki, including potentially sensitive information, user credentials, and intellectual property. The attacker can exfiltrate this data.
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:** The attacker can modify, delete, or corrupt wiki content, leading to misinformation, disruption of services, and loss of data integrity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can execute commands that crash the Gollum application or the entire server, leading to service unavailability.
*   **Malware Installation and Persistence:** The attacker can install malware, backdoors, or rootkits on the server to maintain persistent access, even after the initial vulnerability is patched.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  A compromised Gollum server can be used as a launching point to attack other systems within the internal network, potentially compromising the entire infrastructure.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful RCE attack and subsequent data breach or service disruption can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of command injection and prevent RCE in Gollum deployments, especially when using custom formatters and extensions, the following mitigation strategies are crucial:

**Preventative Measures (Focus on Secure Development):**

*   **Avoid Shell Command Execution Based on User Input:**  The **most effective mitigation** is to **absolutely avoid** executing shell commands based on any user-controlled input within custom formatters or extensions.  Re-evaluate the necessity of shell command execution and explore alternative approaches using built-in programming language functionalities or libraries.
*   **Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization (If Shell Execution is Unavoidable):** If shell command execution is deemed absolutely necessary, implement **extremely rigorous** input validation and sanitization. This is complex and error-prone, so avoidance is strongly preferred.  Techniques include:
    *   **Input Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters, patterns, or values for user input. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Escaping:**  Escape or encode special characters that have meaning in shell commands (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, `*`, `?`, `~`, `!`, `#`, `\`, `'`, `"`). Use appropriate escaping functions provided by the programming language.
    *   **Parameterization/Prepared Statements:**  If possible, use parameterized commands or prepared statements where user input is treated as data and not as part of the command structure. This is often not directly applicable to shell commands but the principle of separating code from data is crucial.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Gollum application and any shell commands with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running as root or highly privileged users.

**Security Best Practices and Infrastructure Hardening:**

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting custom formatters and extensions.  Engage security professionals to assess the code and identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:** Implement mandatory and thorough code reviews for all custom formatters and extensions, with a strong focus on security aspects, particularly input handling and command execution.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block common command injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rulesets that specifically target command injection patterns.
*   **Security Headers:** Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) to enhance the overall security posture of the Gollum application and mitigate related attack vectors.
*   **Sandboxing/Containerization:**  Consider running Gollum within a sandboxed environment or container (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to limit the impact of a potential compromise. Containerization can restrict the attacker's access to the underlying host system.
*   **Dependency Management and Updates:** Keep Gollum and all its dependencies (including libraries used in custom formatters/extensions) up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly monitor for security advisories and apply updates promptly.
*   **Security Training for Developers:** Provide comprehensive security training to developers, focusing on secure coding practices, common web application vulnerabilities (including command injection), and secure development lifecycle principles.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, including unusual command execution patterns or failed login attempts. Set up alerts for security-relevant events.

**Conclusion:**

The "Command Injection -> Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Server" attack path represents a critical security risk for Gollum deployments, particularly when custom formatters or extensions are used. While the core Gollum application is unlikely to be directly vulnerable, the responsibility for security shifts to the developers of these custom components.  Prioritizing the avoidance of shell command execution based on user input, implementing rigorous security practices, and adopting a layered security approach are essential to effectively mitigate this high-risk vulnerability and protect Gollum applications from compromise.
