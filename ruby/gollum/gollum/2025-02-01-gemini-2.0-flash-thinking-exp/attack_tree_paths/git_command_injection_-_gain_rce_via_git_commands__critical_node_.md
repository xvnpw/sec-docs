### 4. Deep Analysis: Git Command Injection -> Gain RCE via Git commands

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Path

This attack path centers around the concept of **Git Command Injection**, which is a specific type of command injection vulnerability. Command injection occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into a system by manipulating input that is used to construct and execute shell commands. In this case, the target is Git commands executed by the Gollum application.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1.  **Git Command Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The Gollum application, or more likely a custom feature or plugin, insecurely constructs Git commands based on user-provided input. This means user input is directly or indirectly incorporated into the command string without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   **Attack Vector (Hypothetical in Core Gollum):**  While core Gollum is designed to be secure, custom extensions or modifications that interact with Git directly and process user input could introduce this vulnerability.  Examples of such hypothetical features could include:
        *   **Custom Git Hooks Management:** A feature allowing administrators to manage Git hooks through the web interface, potentially taking user-provided scripts or parameters.
        *   **Advanced Git Repository Browsing/Manipulation:**  Features that go beyond basic wiki functionality and allow users to execute more complex Git commands through the web interface.
        *   **Integration with External Systems via Git:**  Custom integrations that use Git commands to interact with external systems based on user actions within the wiki.

2.  **Gain RCE via Git commands [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker leverages the Git command injection vulnerability by crafting malicious input. This input is designed to be interpreted as shell commands when the vulnerable Gollum feature executes the constructed Git command.
    *   **Mechanism:** Git commands are often executed by Gollum using system calls or shell execution functions. If user input is not properly escaped or parameterized, attackers can inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`, `||`, `$()`, `` ` ``) or manipulate command arguments to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Example (Illustrative - Not necessarily Gollum core functionality):** Imagine a hypothetical custom feature that allows users to search Git commit messages using a user-provided search term. If the code constructs a Git command like this:

        ```bash
        git log --grep="<USER_INPUT>"
        ```

        And the user input is not sanitized, an attacker could inject:

        ```
        "$(malicious_command)"
        ```

        The resulting command would become:

        ```bash
        git log --grep="$(malicious_command)"
        ```

        The shell would then execute `malicious_command` before executing the `git log` command, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).

#### 4.2. Impact

The impact of successfully exploiting Git command injection and gaining RCE is **CRITICAL**.  It represents a complete compromise of the Gollum application and potentially the underlying server.

*   **Full Server Compromise:**  RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Gollum application process. This often translates to the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `nginx`, `apache`). From this initial foothold, the attacker can:
    *   **Escalate Privileges:** Attempt to escalate privileges to root or other higher-privileged accounts on the server.
    *   **Install Backdoors:** Establish persistent access to the server for future attacks.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data stored within the Gollum wiki, configuration files, or other parts of the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupt the availability of the Gollum application and potentially other services on the server.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

*   **Complete Control over Gollum Application:** The attacker gains full control over the Gollum wiki itself, including:
    *   **Content Manipulation:** Modify, delete, or create wiki pages, potentially defacing the site or injecting malicious content for other users.
    *   **User Account Manipulation:** Create, modify, or delete user accounts, potentially granting themselves administrative access or locking out legitimate users.
    *   **Configuration Changes:** Modify Gollum's configuration to further their objectives or disrupt its operation.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing Git command injection and RCE requires a multi-layered approach focused on secure coding practices and robust input handling.

*   **1. Avoid Constructing Git Commands Based on User Input (Strongest Mitigation):**
    *   **Principle:** The most effective way to prevent command injection is to avoid constructing shell commands dynamically using user input altogether.
    *   **Implementation:**  Design features in a way that minimizes or eliminates the need to directly incorporate user input into Git commands.  Instead of allowing users to specify command arguments directly, provide predefined options or use APIs that abstract away the need for direct command construction.
    *   **Example:** Instead of allowing users to specify a Git command to execute, provide a limited set of pre-defined actions they can perform through the UI, which are then translated into safe Git API calls or pre-constructed commands internally.

*   **2. Implement Extremely Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization (If Command Construction is Unavoidable):**
    *   **Principle:** If constructing Git commands with user input is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape any potentially malicious characters or sequences.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters, patterns, or values for user input. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Escape or remove shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, etc.) from user input before incorporating it into Git commands.  Use appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by the programming language and shell environment.
        *   **Context-Aware Validation:**  Validate input based on the specific context in which it will be used within the Git command. For example, if user input is expected to be a filename, validate that it conforms to filename conventions and does not contain path traversal characters (`..`, `/`).
        *   **Regular Expressions:** Use carefully crafted regular expressions for input validation, but be aware of potential bypasses and the complexity of securing against all possible injection vectors using regex alone.

*   **3. Use Parameterized Git Commands or Libraries that Prevent Command Injection:**
    *   **Principle:** Utilize programming language features or libraries that allow for parameterized command execution, where user input is treated as data rather than command parts.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Analogy):**  Think of this like parameterized SQL queries. Instead of concatenating user input into a command string, use placeholders or parameters that are handled by the execution environment to prevent interpretation as commands.
        *   **Git Libraries/APIs:**  Prefer using Git libraries or APIs provided by your programming language (e.g., `libgit2`, `GitPython`, `JGit`) instead of directly executing Git commands via shell calls. These libraries often provide safer abstractions and methods for interacting with Git repositories without the risk of command injection.
        *   **`subprocess.list2cmdline` (Python Example - for shell execution if absolutely necessary):** If you must use `subprocess` in Python, use `subprocess.list2cmdline` to properly quote command arguments, although this is still less secure than avoiding shell execution altogether.

*   **4. Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Principle:** Run the Gollum application with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Implementation:**  Avoid running Gollum as root or a highly privileged user. Use a dedicated user account with restricted permissions. This limits the impact of RCE, as the attacker's initial access will be confined to the privileges of the Gollum process.

*   **5. Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Principle:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, especially for custom features or plugins that handle user input and interact with Git commands.
    *   **Implementation:**  Involve security experts in the development process to identify potential vulnerabilities early on. Use static and dynamic analysis tools to scan for code weaknesses.

#### 4.4. Conclusion

The **Git Command Injection -> Gain RCE via Git commands** attack path, while stated as "highly unlikely in core Gollum," represents a critical security risk if introduced through custom features or insecure development practices.  The potential impact is severe, leading to full server compromise and complete control over the Gollum application.

The development team must prioritize secure coding practices, especially when dealing with user input and external command execution.  **Avoiding the construction of Git commands based on user input is the most effective mitigation strategy.** If command construction is unavoidable, rigorous input validation, sanitization, and the use of parameterized commands or secure Git libraries are crucial to prevent this critical vulnerability. Regular security audits and code reviews are essential to identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.
