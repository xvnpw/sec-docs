### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: SSRF via Markup

This section delves into the deep analysis of the SSRF via Markup attack surface in Gollum.

#### 4.1. Markup Parsing and External Resource Handling in Gollum

Gollum utilizes various markup engines to render wiki pages, with Markdown being a common choice.  The core vulnerability lies in how these markup engines handle URLs, particularly within image tags and potentially other embedding mechanisms.

*   **Markup Engines:** Gollum supports multiple markup formats, including Markdown, Creole, and others. Each engine has its own syntax for embedding images and links.  The analysis should primarily focus on Markdown as it's widely used, but consider if other engines present similar or different SSRF risks.
*   **Image Embedding (Markdown Example):** In Markdown, images are embedded using the syntax `![alt text](url)`. When Gollum renders a page containing this syntax, it needs to process the `url`.  The critical question is: **Does Gollum's server-side rendering process attempt to fetch and process the resource at this URL?** If yes, and without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to SSRF.
*   **Potential for Other Embedding Mechanisms:** Beyond images, other markup features might also introduce SSRF risks.  Consider:
    *   **Links:** While standard links (`[link text](url)`) might not directly trigger SSRF in the same way as image fetching, they could be abused in combination with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Iframes (if supported by any markup engine and Gollum's rendering):** Iframes are a classic SSRF vector, allowing embedding of entire web pages. If Gollum's markup engines and rendering process allow iframes, this would be a high-risk area.
    *   **Other Media Embeds (e.g., `<video>`, `<audio>` if supported):** Similar to images, these tags might involve fetching resources from URLs.
*   **Server-Side vs. Client-Side Rendering:** It's crucial to understand if Gollum's rendering process is primarily server-side or client-side for external resources. If the URL fetching happens on the server, it's directly vulnerable to SSRF. If it's purely client-side, the risk is significantly reduced (though still potential for client-side vulnerabilities). **Based on the attack surface description, it's assumed that Gollum performs server-side rendering of these resources.**

#### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

An attacker can exploit this SSRF vulnerability by crafting malicious markup within a wiki page. Here are some potential exploitation scenarios:

*   **Internal Network Scanning:**
    *   An attacker can use image tags with URLs pointing to internal IP addresses and ports (e.g., `![Internal Port Scan](http://192.168.1.1:80)`).
    *   When Gollum renders the page, it will attempt to connect to these internal IPs and ports.
    *   By observing the response times or error messages, the attacker can infer which internal hosts and ports are open, effectively performing port scanning of the internal network from the Gollum server.

*   **Accessing Internal Services:**
    *   If internal services are running without proper authentication or with default credentials, an attacker can use SSRF to access them.
    *   Example: `![Admin Panel](http://internal.network/admin)`. If `http://internal.network/admin` is an internal admin panel accessible from the Gollum server, the attacker might be able to access it through SSRF.
    *   This could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation of internal systems.

*   **Information Disclosure (Local File Access - if applicable):**
    *   Depending on Gollum's URL handling and the underlying libraries, it might be possible to use file URLs (e.g., `![Local File](file:///etc/passwd)`) to access local files on the Gollum server.
    *   This is highly dependent on the URL parsing and fetching mechanisms used by Gollum and the underlying operating system.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Internal Services:**
    *   An attacker can repeatedly request resources from internal services using SSRF, potentially overloading them and causing a denial of service.
    *   Example: Embedding multiple images pointing to a resource-intensive internal service endpoint.

*   **Exfiltration of Data (in combination with other vulnerabilities):**
    *   While SSRF itself might not directly exfiltrate data, it can be a stepping stone. For example, if an internal service returns sensitive data in its response, the attacker might be able to capture this data by observing the Gollum server's response or logs (depending on Gollum's logging and error handling).

#### 4.3. Risk Severity and Impact

The risk severity is correctly assessed as **High**. The potential impact of SSRF in Gollum is significant:

*   **Confidentiality:** Access to internal network resources and potential disclosure of sensitive information from internal services or local files.
*   **Integrity:** Potential for unauthorized actions on internal services if they are not properly secured.
*   **Availability:** Denial of service against internal services.
*   **Lateral Movement:** SSRF can be used as a stepping stone for further attacks on internal systems, potentially leading to a broader compromise.

The risk is amplified if Gollum is deployed in a network with sensitive internal resources or if it has access to critical systems.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies Evaluation

The proposed mitigation strategies are relevant and effective for addressing SSRF in Gollum. Let's evaluate each one:

*   **URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Highly effective if implemented correctly. Whitelisting allowed URL schemes (e.g., `https://`, `http://` for specific external domains if needed) and domains is crucial. Blacklisting internal network ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`) and sensitive private IP ranges is also essential.
    *   **Feasibility:** Feasible to implement in Gollum. This can be done at the application level, within the markup parsing/rendering logic.
    *   **Considerations:** Maintaining an accurate and comprehensive whitelist/blacklist is important.  Bypass techniques like URL encoding, redirects, and alternative URL schemes need to be considered and mitigated.  Regularly review and update the lists.

*   **Disable External Resource Embedding (If possible):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  The most secure approach if embedding external resources is not a core requirement. Completely eliminates the SSRF attack surface related to markup.
    *   **Feasibility:** Depends on the functional requirements of Gollum. If embedding images or other external content is essential for wiki functionality, this might not be feasible. However, if it's an optional feature, disabling it is highly recommended.
    *   **Considerations:**  Evaluate the impact on user experience and functionality if this feature is disabled. Provide alternative ways to achieve similar functionality if needed (e.g., uploading images directly to Gollum).

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Important layer of defense even with whitelisting/blacklisting. Validate URLs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or bypass attempts. Sanitize URLs to remove potentially harmful components.
    *   **Feasibility:** Feasible to implement.  Use robust URL parsing libraries and validation functions.
    *   **Considerations:**  Input validation should be comprehensive and cover various URL formats and potential bypass techniques.  It should be used in conjunction with whitelisting/blacklisting, not as a replacement.

*   **Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Reduces the impact of SSRF by limiting the Gollum server's access to sensitive internal networks. If Gollum is isolated in a DMZ or a less privileged network segment, the damage from SSRF is contained.
    *   **Feasibility:**  Highly recommended security best practice. Feasibility depends on the existing network infrastructure and deployment environment.
    *   **Considerations:** Network segmentation is a broader security measure that benefits overall security, not just SSRF mitigation. It should be implemented as part of a comprehensive security strategy.

#### 4.5. Specific Recommendations for Gollum Development Team

Based on this analysis, the following specific recommendations are provided to the Gollum development team:

1.  **Prioritize Mitigation:** Address the SSRF via Markup vulnerability as a high priority due to its significant risk.
2.  **Implement URL Whitelisting:**
    *   Implement a strict URL whitelist for embedded resources.
    *   Initially, only allow `https://` and `http://` schemes for explicitly whitelisted external domains (if external resources are absolutely necessary).
    *   **Strongly recommend whitelisting only `https://` and ideally disallowing external domains entirely if possible.**
    *   **Blacklist all private IP ranges** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`) and potentially other sensitive IP ranges.
3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Implement robust URL validation and sanitization before attempting to fetch any external resource.
    *   Use a well-vetted URL parsing library to handle URL parsing and validation.
    *   Sanitize URLs to remove potentially harmful characters or encoding tricks.
4.  **Consider Disabling External Resource Embedding:**
    *   Evaluate if embedding external resources is a core feature of Gollum.
    *   If not, provide a configuration option to completely disable external resource embedding to eliminate this attack surface. This is the most secure option.
5.  **Review Markup Engines and Features:**
    *   Thoroughly review all markup engines supported by Gollum and identify all features that allow embedding external resources.
    *   Apply mitigation strategies consistently across all relevant markup engines and features.
6.  **Security Testing:**
    *   Conduct thorough security testing, including manual testing and automated scanning, to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies and identify any potential bypasses.
7.  **Documentation and User Guidance:**
    *   Document the implemented mitigation strategies and configuration options related to external resource handling.
    *   Provide clear guidance to Gollum users and administrators on how to configure Gollum securely and mitigate SSRF risks.
