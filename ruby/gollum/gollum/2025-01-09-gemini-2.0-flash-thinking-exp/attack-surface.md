# Attack Surface Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown/Markup Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdownmarkup_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into wiki pages that are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing those pages.

**How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum's core functionality involves rendering user-provided Markdown (and potentially other markup languages) into HTML. If this rendering process doesn't properly sanitize or escape user input, malicious scripts embedded within the Markdown can be executed.

**Example:** A user creates a page with the following Markdown: `[Click me!](javascript:alert('XSS'))`. When another user clicks the link, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` will execute in their browser. Alternatively, `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` could be used.

**Impact:**
*   Session hijacking (stealing user cookies).
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Defacement of wiki pages.
*   Credential theft (if the injected script attempts to capture user input).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Utilize Gollum's built-in sanitization features:** Ensure Gollum's configuration properly escapes or strips potentially dangerous HTML tags and JavaScript.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   **Regularly update Gollum:** Keep Gollum updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload (Attachments)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload__attachments_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can upload arbitrary files, including potentially malicious ones, to the server hosting the Gollum instance.

**How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum allows users to attach files to wiki pages. If the application doesn't properly validate the type and content of uploaded files, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image (e.g., `malicious.php.jpg`). If the server is configured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, accessing this file could execute the malicious script.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the server.
*   Serving malware to other users.
*   Storage exhaustion (DoS).
*   Information disclosure if sensitive files are uploaded.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Strict file type validation:** Implement server-side checks to ensure only allowed file types are uploaded. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   **Content-Type sniffing prevention:** Configure the web server to prevent content-type sniffing and force downloads for attachments.
    *   **Secure storage location:** Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
    *   **Antivirus scanning:** Integrate antivirus scanning for uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of `.git` Directory](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of___git__directory.md)

**Description:** The `.git` directory, containing the repository's history and sensitive information, is publicly accessible via the web.

**How Gollum Contributes:** Gollum is built on top of a Git repository. If the web server serving the Gollum instance is not properly configured, the `.git` directory located within the repository can be directly accessed through the web.

**Example:** An attacker accesses `http://your-gollum-domain.com/.git/config` and retrieves the repository's configuration, potentially including sensitive information.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of the entire Git history, including past revisions of pages and potentially deleted sensitive information.
*   Disclosure of internal file structures and configurations.
*   Potential for extracting credentials or API keys stored in the repository history.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Web server configuration:** Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to deny access to the `.git` directory and its contents. This is a crucial security measure.
    *   **Ensure proper deployment:** Verify that deployment scripts or processes do not accidentally expose the `.git` directory.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Gollum's authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to the wiki or specific pages.

**How Gollum Contributes:** If Gollum is configured with authentication, weaknesses in its implementation can be exploited. This could involve bypassing login procedures or gaining elevated privileges.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the password reset functionality allows an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization. Alternatively, a flaw in the access control logic allows a user to edit pages they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   Modification or deletion of wiki content.
*   Account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Secure authentication mechanisms:** Use robust and well-vetted authentication methods. Avoid custom implementations if possible, and leverage established libraries.
    *   **Proper authorization checks:** Implement thorough checks to ensure users only have access to resources they are permitted to access.
    *   **Regular security audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Follow security best practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent common authentication and authorization flaws.
