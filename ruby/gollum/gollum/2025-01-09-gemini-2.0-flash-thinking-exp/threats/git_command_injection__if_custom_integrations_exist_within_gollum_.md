## Deep Dive Analysis: Git Command Injection in Gollum Custom Integrations

This analysis focuses on the identified threat of **Git Command Injection (if custom integrations exist within Gollum)**. We will delve into the specifics of this threat, its potential impact on our Gollum application, and provide detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Understanding the Threat in the Gollum Context:**

The core of this threat lies in the potential for custom integrations within Gollum to directly execute Git commands based on user-controlled input. Gollum, at its heart, is a Git-backed wiki. While its core functionality is generally secure against direct command injection due to its internal handling of Git operations, the introduction of **custom integrations or plugins** creates new attack surfaces.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Custom Integrations Exist:**  This analysis hinges on the assumption that our Gollum instance utilizes custom-developed integrations or plugins. These could be for extending functionality, automating tasks, or integrating with other systems.
* **Direct Git Command Execution:**  The vulnerability arises if these custom integrations directly invoke Git commands using libraries or system calls (e.g., `system()`, `exec()`, `subprocess.run()` in Python, or similar mechanisms in other languages).
* **User-Controlled Input:**  The critical element is that some portion of the Git command being executed is derived from user input. This could be directly from form fields, URL parameters, API requests, or even indirectly through data stored in the Gollum wiki itself.

**2. Deeper Dive into the Attack Vector:**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would aim to manipulate the user-controlled input that is ultimately passed to the Git command. By injecting malicious commands or arguments, they can alter the intended behavior of the Git execution.

**Examples of Potential Attack Scenarios:**

* **Manipulating `git log` commands:** A custom integration might allow users to search commit history based on keywords. An attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` or `&& cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/exposed.txt && git commit -m "Oops" --author="attacker <attacker@example.com>"` within the search term.
* **Exploiting file operations:** If a plugin allows users to interact with files in the Git repository (e.g., viewing diffs, retrieving specific file versions), an attacker could inject commands to access or modify arbitrary files on the server. For example, injecting `--output=/path/to/sensitive/file` into a `git show` command.
* **Abusing branch/tag manipulation:** If custom integrations allow users to create or delete branches/tags based on input, an attacker could inject commands to execute arbitrary code during the Git operation hooks.
* **Leveraging Git aliases:**  If user input is used to specify Git aliases, an attacker could potentially define a malicious alias that gets executed.

**3. Impact Assessment:**

The potential impact of a successful Git Command Injection attack is severe, aligning with the "Critical" risk severity:

* **Server Compromise:**  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Gollum instance. This could lead to complete control over the server, including installing malware, creating backdoors, and accessing sensitive data.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  As mentioned above, the attacker can run any code the Gollum process has permissions to execute. This could involve system-level commands, scripts, or even compiled binaries.
* **Data Manipulation in the Git Repository:**  Attackers can modify the Git repository itself, potentially:
    * **Introducing malicious content:** Injecting backdoors or malware into wiki pages.
    * **Deleting or corrupting data:** Removing critical information or history.
    * **Changing commit history:**  Manipulating authorship or introducing false information.
    * **Exfiltrating sensitive data:**  Pushing copies of sensitive files to attacker-controlled repositories.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could execute commands that consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**4. Affected Gollum Components (Focus on Custom Integrations):**

The core Gollum application is likely not directly vulnerable to this threat. The focus is squarely on **custom integrations or plugins** that:

* **Accept user input:**  Any mechanism through which users can provide data to the integration.
* **Process that input:**  The logic within the integration that handles the user-provided data.
* **Execute Git commands:**  The point where the integration uses the user input to construct and execute a Git command.

**Specific areas to scrutinize within custom integrations:**

* **Form handlers:**  Code that processes data submitted through web forms.
* **API endpoints:**  Code that handles requests to custom API endpoints.
* **Background job processors:**  Code that executes tasks based on user-initiated actions.
* **Event listeners/hooks:**  Code that responds to events within Gollum or the Git repository.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

Expanding on the provided mitigation strategies, here's a more in-depth look at how to address this threat:

* **Avoid Direct Git Command Execution Based on User Input:** This is the most effective strategy. Whenever possible, **abstract away the direct execution of Git commands**. Instead of constructing Git commands dynamically based on user input, consider:
    * **Using Git libraries or APIs:**  Libraries like `GitPython` (Python), `libgit2` (C), or similar libraries in other languages provide a more controlled way to interact with Git, often with built-in safeguards against command injection.
    * **Predefined actions:**  Design integrations to perform specific, predefined Git operations based on user choices rather than allowing arbitrary command construction.
    * **Data-driven approaches:**  If the goal is to filter or retrieve data from Git, explore using Git's data structures and querying capabilities rather than relying on complex command-line arguments.

* **Carefully Sanitize and Validate All User Input:** If direct Git command execution is unavoidable, rigorous input sanitization and validation are crucial.
    * **Input Validation:**  Define strict rules for what constitutes valid input. Use whitelisting (allowing only known good characters or patterns) rather than blacklisting (trying to block known bad characters).
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Properly escape or encode user input before incorporating it into Git commands. Use language-specific functions for escaping shell metacharacters (e.g., `shlex.quote()` in Python).
    * **Contextual Sanitization:**  Sanitize based on the specific context of the Git command being executed. Different commands and arguments may have different vulnerabilities.

* **Use Parameterized Commands (Where Possible):**  While Git itself doesn't have direct parameterized command execution in the same way as database queries, you can achieve a similar effect by:
    * **Separating data from commands:**  Construct the core Git command statically and then pass user-provided data as separate arguments or options.
    * **Using Git's `--` separator:**  This can help prevent misinterpretation of user input as command options. For example: `git log --author="$user_input" --`.

* **Run Git Commands with the Least Necessary Privileges:**  The Gollum process should ideally not run as a privileged user (e.g., `root`). Furthermore, if possible, configure the environment in which Git commands are executed to have restricted permissions. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve command injection. Consider:
    * **Dedicated user for Gollum:**  Run the Gollum application under a dedicated user account with minimal necessary permissions.
    * **Restricting Git access:**  If possible, configure Git to operate with limited access to the file system or other resources.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

Proactive detection and monitoring are essential to identify potential exploitation attempts or vulnerabilities:

* **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review the code of all custom integrations, paying close attention to how user input is handled and how Git commands are executed.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):**  Utilize SAST tools that can identify potential command injection vulnerabilities in the codebase.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the running application.
* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Gollum instance and its custom integrations.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement robust logging to track the execution of Git commands by custom integrations. Monitor these logs for suspicious patterns or unexpected commands.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Configure IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious Git commands being executed on the server.

**7. Prevention Best Practices:**

Beyond the specific mitigation strategies, adhering to general secure development practices is crucial:

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users, applications, and processes.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep Gollum and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers about common security threats, including command injection, and how to prevent them.
* **Input Validation Everywhere:**  Validate user input at every point it enters the application, not just before executing Git commands.

**8. Conclusion:**

Git Command Injection in custom Gollum integrations represents a significant security risk. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. A layered approach, combining secure coding practices, thorough input validation, and proactive monitoring, is essential to protect our Gollum application and the sensitive data it manages. The development team must prioritize security throughout the development lifecycle of any custom integrations. Remember, the most effective defense is to avoid direct Git command execution based on user input whenever possible.
