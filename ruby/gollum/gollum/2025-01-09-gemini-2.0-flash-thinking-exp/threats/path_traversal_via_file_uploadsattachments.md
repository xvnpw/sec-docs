## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal via File Uploads/Attachments in Gollum

This analysis delves into the threat of Path Traversal via File Uploads/Attachments within the context of the Gollum wiki application. While Gollum itself is primarily a Git-backed wiki and doesn't inherently offer a direct file upload feature in the traditional sense, we need to consider potential attack vectors arising from how users might interact with the underlying Git repository or any extensions/plugins that *could* introduce file upload capabilities.

**Understanding the Threat in the Gollum Context:**

The core of the Path Traversal vulnerability lies in manipulating filenames to access or overwrite files outside the intended directory. While Gollum doesn't have a built-in "upload button," the threat becomes relevant in scenarios where:

1. **Plugins or Extensions:**  If a plugin or extension is added to Gollum to provide file upload functionality (e.g., for attaching images or documents to wiki pages), this becomes a prime target.
2. **Direct Git Repository Manipulation:** While less direct, if an attacker gains write access to the underlying Git repository (through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in Git server configuration), they could commit files with malicious filenames directly. This is less about a traditional "upload" but achieves the same outcome.
3. **Misconfigured Web Server:** If the web server hosting Gollum (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is misconfigured to directly serve files from the Git repository's working directory without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to exploit this.

**Deep Dive into the Threat Mechanism:**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would craft filenames containing path traversal sequences like:

* `../../../../etc/passwd` (to attempt reading sensitive system files)
* `../../../var/www/gollum/config.yml` (to access Gollum's configuration)
* `../../../public/malicious.php` (to attempt overwriting or creating executable files within the webroot, if allowed)

When Gollum (or the vulnerable component) processes or stores a file with such a name, it might interpret the `..` sequences as instructions to move up the directory structure. This could lead to:

* **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, or application code.
* **Data Corruption:** Overwriting critical application files, leading to malfunction or denial of service.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In severe cases, if the attacker can upload and execute code (e.g., a PHP script) by placing it in the webroot, they can gain complete control over the server.

**Gollum-Specific Considerations:**

* **Git as the Backend:** Gollum's reliance on Git for storage is a crucial factor. While Git itself has mechanisms to prevent certain types of file manipulation, it doesn't inherently sanitize filenames for path traversal vulnerabilities in the context of a web application.
* **Lack of Native Upload Feature:** The absence of a built-in upload feature in core Gollum reduces the immediate attack surface. However, the threat shifts to how users *are* adding files, which often involves Git operations.
* **Plugin Ecosystem:**  The risk is significantly higher if plugins adding file upload functionality are used. These plugins might not have the same level of security scrutiny as the core Gollum application.
* **Web Server Configuration:** The security of the web server hosting Gollum is paramount. Misconfigurations that allow direct access to the Git repository's working directory can bypass any security measures within Gollum itself.

**Technical Deep Dive - How the Attack Might Manifest:**

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where a Gollum plugin allows users to attach files to wiki pages:

1. **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a file named `../../../public/uploads/malicious.jpg`.
2. **Plugin Processing:** The vulnerable plugin, upon receiving this filename, might directly use it to save the uploaded file without proper validation.
3. **File System Interaction:** The operating system, interpreting the path traversal sequence, saves the file in the `public/uploads` directory relative to the plugin's working directory (which could be the webroot or a sensitive location).
4. **Impact:**  If the attacker can upload an executable file (and the web server is configured to execute it), they achieve RCE. Even non-executable files can lead to information disclosure if placed in accessible locations.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies for Gollum:**

Based on the potential attack vectors, here's a breakdown of mitigation strategies tailored for Gollum:

* **Focus on Input Validation at the Point of Entry:**
    * **For Plugins:** If using plugins with upload functionality, rigorously audit their code for filename validation. Ensure they implement strict sanitization by:
        * **Whitelisting allowed characters:** Only permit alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
        * **Blacklisting path traversal sequences:** Explicitly reject filenames containing `..`, `./`, or absolute paths.
        * **Replacing path traversal sequences:**  Replace instances of `..` with a safe alternative or remove them entirely.
    * **For Direct Git Commits:** Educate users on secure Git practices and the risks of committing files with malicious names. Implement pre-commit hooks that analyze filenames for suspicious patterns.
* **Secure File Storage:**
    * **Dedicated Upload Directory:** Store uploaded files in a dedicated directory *outside* the webroot. This prevents direct access via HTTP requests.
    * **Randomized Filenames:**  Rename uploaded files to unique, non-guessable names (e.g., using UUIDs or hash values). This eliminates the attacker's ability to predict file locations.
    * **Database Mapping:**  Maintain a mapping between the original filename and the stored filename in a database. This allows retrieval without relying on the potentially malicious original filename.
* **Controlled File Serving:**
    * **Avoid Direct Serving:** Never directly serve uploaded files from their storage location.
    * **Controlled Endpoint:** Implement a dedicated endpoint within Gollum that handles requests for uploaded files. This endpoint should:
        * **Authenticate and authorize access:** Ensure only authorized users can access specific files.
        * **Retrieve the file using the secure, randomized filename.**
        * **Set appropriate `Content-Disposition` headers:** Force downloads or specify safe display methods to prevent browser-based exploits.
* **Web Server Hardening:**
    * **Disable Directory Listing:** Prevent web servers from listing the contents of directories, especially the Git repository and any upload directories.
    * **Restrict Access to Git Repository:** Ensure the web server user has minimal necessary permissions to the Git repository. Ideally, it should not have write access.
    * **Input Validation at the Web Server Level:** Configure the web server to reject requests with suspicious path traversal sequences in URLs.
* **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**
    * **Keep Gollum and its dependencies up-to-date:**  Patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
    * **Conduct regular security audits:** Review the configuration of Gollum, its plugins, and the web server.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Consider periodic penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * Educate developers and administrators about the risks of path traversal vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
    * Train users on secure Git practices and the dangers of committing files with untrusted names.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor web server access logs for suspicious patterns like repeated attempts to access files with `..` sequences in the URL.
* **File System Monitoring:** Implement tools that monitor file system changes for the creation or modification of files in unexpected locations with suspicious names.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS rules to detect and block requests containing path traversal sequences.
* **Git Repository Auditing:** Regularly review the Git commit history for files with unusual or suspicious filenames.

**Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
* **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development process for any plugins or extensions.

**Conclusion:**

While core Gollum doesn't inherently feature file uploads, the threat of Path Traversal via File Uploads/Attachments remains relevant due to potential plugins, direct Git repository interactions, and web server configurations. A proactive approach focusing on input validation, secure file storage, controlled file serving, and robust web server hardening is crucial to mitigate this high-severity risk. Regular security audits and awareness training are essential for maintaining a secure Gollum environment. The development team should prioritize understanding how file uploads are handled (or could be handled) within their specific Gollum setup and implement the appropriate mitigation strategies.
