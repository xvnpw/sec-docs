## Deep Dive Analysis: Unrestricted File Upload (Attachments) in Gollum Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Unrestricted File Upload (Attachments)" attack surface within an application utilizing the Gollum wiki engine. We will break down the attack vectors, potential impacts, and provide comprehensive mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Attack Surface: Unrestricted File Upload (Attachments)**

**Core Vulnerability:** The application, through its integration with Gollum, allows users to upload files without sufficient validation and restrictions on the type and content of these files. This creates a significant entry point for malicious actors.

**Detailed Attack Vector Analysis:**

1. **Direct Malicious File Upload:**
    * **Executable Files:** Attackers can upload executable files (e.g., `.exe`, `.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`) directly. If the server's configuration allows execution from the upload directory, these files can be triggered, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    * **Web Shells:** Uploading web shells (e.g., PHP, ASPX, JSP scripts) disguised with misleading extensions (as in the example) allows attackers to gain persistent access and control over the server.
    * **Malware Droppers:** Attackers can upload files designed to download and execute further malicious payloads on the server or client machines.

2. **File Type Manipulation and Bypasses:**
    * **Double Extensions:** Attackers might use double extensions (e.g., `malicious.php.jpg`) hoping the server only checks the last extension.
    * **MIME Type Spoofing:** While server-side validation is crucial, attackers might try to manipulate the `Content-Type` header during the upload to bypass weak client-side checks.
    * **Null Byte Injection (Less Common):** In older systems, attackers might try to inject null bytes (`%00`) into the filename to truncate it and bypass extension checks.

3. **Content Exploitation:**
    * **HTML/SVG with Malicious JavaScript:** Uploading HTML or SVG files containing malicious JavaScript can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when other users view the page with the attached file. This can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.
    * **Office Documents with Macros:** Malicious Office documents with embedded macros can be uploaded. If users download and open these documents with macros enabled, the malicious code can execute on their machines.
    * **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** Uploading specially crafted XML files can potentially allow attackers to read local files on the server or interact with internal systems.

4. **Filename Exploitation:**
    * **Path Traversal:** While less likely in a basic upload scenario, if the application mishandles filenames, attackers might attempt to use ".." sequences to upload files to restricted directories.
    * **Overwriting Existing Files:** If the application doesn't handle filename collisions properly, attackers might be able to overwrite existing files, potentially causing data loss or service disruption.

5. **Resource Exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Large File Uploads:** Attackers can upload extremely large files to consume storage space, potentially leading to a Denial of Service by filling up the server's disk.
    * **Maliciously Crafted Files:** Certain file types (e.g., highly compressible archives that expand significantly upon decompression) can consume excessive CPU and memory resources during processing, leading to DoS.

6. **Social Engineering Attacks:**
    * **Misleading Filenames and Content:** Attackers can upload files with enticing or urgent-sounding names to trick users into downloading and opening them.

**Gollum's Specific Contribution to the Attack Surface:**

* **Attachment Feature:** Gollum's core functionality of allowing file attachments directly introduces this attack surface.
* **Default Storage Location:** The default storage location for attachments might be within the web server's document root if not configured otherwise, making uploaded files directly accessible and potentially executable.
* **Lack of Built-in Advanced Security Features:** Gollum itself doesn't inherently provide robust file validation, antivirus scanning, or sandboxing mechanisms. These security measures need to be implemented by the application integrating Gollum.
* **Potential for Plugin Vulnerabilities:** If the Gollum instance uses plugins related to file handling or display, vulnerabilities in those plugins could further exacerbate the risk.

**Impact Analysis (Expanded):**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most critical impact. Successful RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and further attacks.
* **Malware Distribution:** The server can become a platform for distributing malware to other users who download the infected files. This can impact internal users, external visitors, or even other systems on the network.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** As mentioned before, this can be achieved through storage exhaustion or resource exhaustion by uploading large or maliciously crafted files.
* **Information Disclosure:** If attackers upload files containing sensitive information or if they manage to access and download other users' uploaded files, it can lead to data breaches and privacy violations.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Uploaded HTML or SVG files can inject malicious scripts into the application, compromising user sessions and potentially leading to credential theft or further attacks.
* **Social Engineering:** Malicious attachments can be used to trick users into performing actions that compromise their accounts or systems.
* **Data Corruption/Loss:** In scenarios where filename collisions are not handled correctly, attackers might be able to overwrite legitimate files, leading to data loss or corruption.
* **Compromise of Other Services:** If the server hosting Gollum is connected to other internal services, a successful attack could be used as a stepping stone to compromise those services as well.

**Risk Severity: Critical**

This risk is classified as critical due to the potential for Remote Code Execution, which can have devastating consequences for the application, the server, and its users.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Expanded and Actionable):**

**Developers:**

* **Strict File Type Validation (Server-Side Focus):**
    * **Whitelist Approach:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed file extensions and MIME types. Reject any file that doesn't match this whitelist.
    * **Magic Number Verification:**  Go beyond file extensions and verify the file's content by checking its "magic number" (the first few bytes of the file). This is a more reliable way to determine the true file type. Libraries exist for various programming languages to assist with this.
    * **Avoid Blacklisting:** Blacklisting is generally less secure as attackers can easily find ways to bypass it.
    * **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure file extension checks are case-insensitive to prevent bypasses like `.PHP`.

* **Content-Type Sniffing Prevention:**
    * **`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` Header:** Configure the web server to send this header for all served attachments. This instructs browsers not to try and infer the MIME type of the file, forcing them to rely on the server's declared `Content-Type`.
    * **Force Downloads:**  Configure the web server to serve attachments with the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header. This forces the browser to download the file instead of trying to render it, mitigating the risk of executing malicious scripts embedded in HTML or SVG files.

* **Secure Storage Location:**
    * **Outside Web Server's Document Root:**  Store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible by the web server. This prevents direct execution of uploaded scripts.
    * **Restricted Execution Permissions:** Ensure the upload directory has minimal permissions. Remove execute permissions for the web server user.
    * **Randomized Filenames:**  Rename uploaded files with unique, randomly generated names to prevent attackers from predicting file paths or overwriting existing files.

* **Antivirus Scanning:**
    * **Integration with Antivirus Engines:** Integrate an antivirus or malware scanning engine into the upload process. Scan every uploaded file before it is stored.
    * **Real-time Scanning:** Implement real-time scanning to immediately detect and block malicious uploads.
    * **Regular Updates:** Ensure the antivirus engine's signature database is regularly updated to detect the latest threats.

* **Input Sanitization and Validation (Filename):**
    * **Remove Potentially Dangerous Characters:** Sanitize filenames by removing or replacing characters that could be used for path traversal or other exploits.
    * **Limit Filename Length:** Impose reasonable limits on filename length to prevent potential buffer overflows or other issues.

* **Sandboxing and Isolation:**
    * **Dedicated Upload Processing:** Consider processing uploaded files in an isolated environment (e.g., a container or virtual machine) to limit the impact of any successful exploit.

* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Limit Upload Frequency and Size:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from overwhelming the server with numerous large file uploads, mitigating DoS attempts.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Proactive Security Assessment:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests specifically targeting the file upload functionality to identify and address vulnerabilities.

* **User Education:**
    * **Educate Users on Safe Upload Practices:**  Inform users about the risks of uploading sensitive or potentially malicious files.

* **Error Handling:**
    * **Avoid Revealing Sensitive Information:**  Ensure error messages related to file uploads do not reveal sensitive information about the server's configuration or file system.

**Deployment and Infrastructure:**

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter malicious requests and potentially block attempts to upload suspicious files.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Implement IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity related to file uploads.
* **Secure Server Configuration:**  Harden the server by disabling unnecessary services and ensuring proper security configurations.

**Long-Term Considerations:**

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities that might arise from uploaded HTML or SVG files.
* **Regularly Update Gollum:** Keep the Gollum instance updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Monitor Upload Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring of file upload activity to detect suspicious patterns or anomalies.

**Conclusion:**

The "Unrestricted File Upload (Attachments)" attack surface presents a significant security risk for applications utilizing Gollum. By implementing the comprehensive mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and protect the application, server, and users from potential harm. A layered security approach, combining robust server-side validation, secure storage practices, and proactive monitoring, is crucial for effectively addressing this critical vulnerability. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance and adaptation are necessary to stay ahead of evolving threats.
