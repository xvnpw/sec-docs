## Deep Analysis of XSS via Markdown/Markup Injection in Gollum

This document provides a deep analysis of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack surface within the Gollum wiki application, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities arising from Markdown/Markup injection. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the risks, potential attack vectors, and implement effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Deeper Dive into the Vulnerability:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the trust placed in user-provided content. Gollum's primary function is to render this content, often in Markdown, into HTML for display in a web browser. This process inherently involves transforming user input into executable code (HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript). If this transformation isn't handled with extreme care, malicious actors can inject code that will be executed within the context of other users' browsers.

**Key Aspects of the Vulnerability:**

* **Markdown's Flexibility:** While a powerful and user-friendly markup language, Markdown allows for the embedding of raw HTML. This is a significant entry point for XSS attacks if not properly controlled.
* **Gollum's Rendering Pipeline:** The specific libraries and methods Gollum uses to parse and render Markdown are crucial. Vulnerabilities can exist within these libraries themselves or in how Gollum configures and utilizes them.
* **Context of Execution:** The injected script executes within the user's browser session, having access to cookies, session storage, and other sensitive information associated with the Gollum application.
* **Persistence:**  Since wiki pages are typically stored, this type of XSS is usually **stored XSS**, meaning the malicious script is permanently embedded and will affect all users who view the compromised page. This significantly amplifies the impact.

**2. Expanding on Attack Vectors:**

Beyond the basic examples provided, attackers can employ more sophisticated techniques:

* **Obfuscated JavaScript:** Attackers can use various encoding methods (e.g., base64, URL encoding, hexadecimal encoding) to hide malicious JavaScript within Markdown, potentially bypassing basic sanitization attempts.
* **Event Handlers in HTML Tags:**  Beyond `onerror`, other HTML event handlers like `onload`, `onmouseover`, `onclick`, etc., can be leveraged to execute JavaScript. For example: `<img src="invalid" onload="malicious_code()">`.
* **Data URIs:** Attackers can embed JavaScript within data URIs used as image sources or other resource locations. For example: `<a href="data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>">Click me</a>`.
* **CSS Injection (Indirect XSS):** While less direct, malicious CSS can be injected to manipulate the page layout in a way that tricks users or even to exfiltrate data using techniques like CSS injection to external servers.
* **Markdown Extensions:** If Gollum supports any Markdown extensions (e.g., for embedding iframes or other external content), these can be potential attack vectors if not carefully implemented and sanitized.
* **Bypassing Basic Sanitization:** Attackers constantly find new ways to bypass common sanitization filters. Simple blacklists of tags are often insufficient. For example, using variations in capitalization or adding extra attributes.

**3. Deeper Understanding of Impact:**

The impact of XSS attacks on Gollum can be more nuanced than just the listed points:

* **Internal Network Exposure:** If the Gollum instance is hosted on an internal network, successful XSS attacks could allow attackers to gain a foothold within the organization's internal systems by targeting users within that network.
* **Data Exfiltration Beyond Credentials:**  Attackers can potentially exfiltrate other sensitive information displayed on the wiki pages, such as internal project details, code snippets, or confidential documents.
* **Social Engineering Attacks:** Injected scripts can be used to create fake login forms or other deceptive elements to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
* **Botnet Recruitment:**  Compromised browsers can be silently recruited into botnets for various malicious activities.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While less common, injected scripts could potentially overload the user's browser, leading to a denial-of-service for that specific user.

**4. Elaborating on Mitigation Strategies:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but they need further elaboration and specific considerations for Gollum:

**a) Utilizing Gollum's Built-in Sanitization Features:**

* **Identify and Understand Gollum's Sanitization:**  The development team needs to thoroughly research Gollum's documentation and source code to understand exactly how it handles Markdown rendering and what sanitization mechanisms are in place.
* **Configuration is Key:** Ensure that Gollum's sanitization features are **enabled and configured correctly**. Default configurations might not be sufficient.
* **Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting:**  Favor a **whitelist approach** where only explicitly allowed HTML tags and attributes are permitted. Blacklisting is often easier to bypass.
* **Contextual Output Encoding:** Understand the difference between HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, and URL encoding. Apply the appropriate encoding based on where the user-provided content is being displayed.
* **Regularly Review and Update Sanitization Rules:** As new attack vectors emerge, the sanitization rules need to be reviewed and updated accordingly.

**b) Content Security Policy (CSP):**

* **Implementation is Crucial:** Simply setting a CSP header is not enough. It needs to be **carefully crafted and tested** to avoid blocking legitimate functionality.
* **`script-src` Directive:** This is the most critical directive for mitigating XSS. Start with a restrictive policy like `script-src 'self'` and gradually add trusted sources as needed. Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` as it defeats the purpose of CSP.
* **`object-src` Directive:** Restricts the sources from which `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements can be loaded.
* **`style-src` Directive:** Controls the sources of stylesheets. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` here as well.
* **`frame-ancestors` Directive:** Prevents the Gollum wiki from being embedded in malicious iframes on other websites (clickjacking protection).
* **Report-URI or report-to Directive:** Configure CSP reporting to receive notifications when policy violations occur, allowing for monitoring and debugging.

**c) Regularly Update Gollum:**

* **Stay Informed:** Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Gollum to be aware of any reported vulnerabilities and patches.
* **Establish a Patching Schedule:** Implement a process for regularly updating Gollum to the latest stable version.
* **Test Updates Thoroughly:** Before deploying updates to production, test them in a staging environment to ensure compatibility and avoid introducing new issues.

**d) Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation:**  While not a primary defense against XSS, validating user input can help prevent other types of attacks and potentially limit the scope of XSS vulnerabilities. For example, limiting the length of page titles or content.
* **Consider a Security Review of Gollum's Code:** If resources permit, a professional security audit of Gollum's codebase can identify potential vulnerabilities that might not be apparent through standard testing.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If Gollum relies on external JavaScript libraries, use SRI to ensure that the loaded scripts haven't been tampered with.
* **HTTP Only and Secure Flags for Cookies:** Set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing them, mitigating the risk of session hijacking. Use the `Secure` flag to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
* **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering out malicious requests before they reach the Gollum application.
* **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of pasting untrusted content into the wiki and the potential for malicious links.

**5. Testing and Verification:**

It's crucial to rigorously test the implemented mitigation strategies:

* **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to inject various XSS payloads, including those listed in the "Attack Vectors" section, to verify that the sanitization and CSP are effective.
* **Automated Scanning:** Utilize security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to automatically identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security professionals to conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of any modifications made to Gollum's codebase to ensure that security best practices are followed.

**6. Developer Considerations:**

* **Security Mindset:** Foster a security-conscious mindset within the development team. Security should be considered throughout the development lifecycle, not just as an afterthought.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and avoiding the use of dangerous functions.
* **Regular Security Training:** Provide developers with regular training on common web application vulnerabilities, including XSS, and how to prevent them.
* **Utilize Security Linters and Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate security linters and static analysis tools into the development workflow to automatically identify potential security flaws in the code.

**Conclusion:**

Cross-Site Scripting via Markdown/Markup injection is a significant security risk for Gollum. Addressing this vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach involving proper configuration and utilization of Gollum's built-in features, implementation of a strong Content Security Policy, regular updates, and ongoing testing and verification. The development team plays a crucial role in implementing and maintaining these mitigations. By understanding the intricacies of this attack surface and proactively implementing robust security measures, the risk of successful XSS attacks can be significantly reduced, protecting users and the integrity of the Gollum wiki.
