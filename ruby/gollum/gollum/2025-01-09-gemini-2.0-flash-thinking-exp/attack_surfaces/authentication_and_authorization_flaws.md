## Deep Dive Analysis: Authentication and Authorization Flaws in Gollum

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Authentication and Authorization Flaws" attack surface for an application utilizing the Gollum wiki. We will dissect the potential vulnerabilities, explore specific attack scenarios, and elaborate on mitigation strategies, focusing on the development team's responsibilities.

**Expanding on "How Gollum Contributes":**

While Gollum itself is a relatively simple wiki engine built on top of Git, its contribution to authentication and authorization flaws stems from several key areas:

* **Configuration Flexibility:** Gollum offers various configuration options for authentication, ranging from no authentication to relying on external systems. This flexibility, while beneficial, introduces complexity and potential for misconfiguration. If authentication is enabled, the chosen method and its implementation within the application become critical attack vectors.
* **Limited Built-in Authentication:** Gollum's core doesn't provide sophisticated, fine-grained access control mechanisms. It primarily relies on basic authentication (username/password) or integration with external authentication providers. This simplicity can be a weakness if the application requires more granular permissions.
* **Reliance on External Systems:**  Applications often integrate Gollum with external authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, OAuth) or implement custom authentication layers. Vulnerabilities in these external systems or the integration logic directly impact the security of the Gollum instance.
* **Potential for Customization:** Developers might extend Gollum's functionality or implement custom authentication/authorization logic. This custom code, if not written securely, can introduce significant vulnerabilities.
* **Assumptions About Deployment Environment:** Gollum might make assumptions about the security of the environment it's deployed in. For example, it might assume that if it's behind a reverse proxy, the proxy handles authentication. If this assumption is incorrect or the proxy is misconfigured, it can lead to bypasses.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Scenarios:**

Let's expand on the provided example and explore other potential vulnerabilities:

**1. Basic Authentication Weaknesses:**

* **Brute-Force Attacks:** If basic authentication is used without proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, attackers can attempt to guess credentials through repeated login attempts.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers might use compromised credentials from other breaches to try and log into the Gollum instance.
* **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** If the application stores user credentials (even temporarily) in a weak manner (e.g., plain text, poorly hashed), attackers gaining access to the system could retrieve them.
* **Default Credentials:** If the application sets up default administrator accounts or credentials that are not changed, attackers can easily gain access.

**2. Password Reset Vulnerabilities:**

* **Lack of Proper Verification:** If the password reset process doesn't adequately verify the user's identity (e.g., weak security questions, predictable reset tokens), attackers can initiate password resets for other users.
* **Insecure Reset Token Generation or Handling:** Predictable or easily guessable reset tokens can be exploited to reset passwords without legitimate access. Storing reset tokens insecurely can also lead to compromise.
* **Account Enumeration:** If the password reset functionality reveals whether an email address is associated with an account, attackers can use this to enumerate valid usernames.

**3. Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities:**

* **Missing or Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Code paths that allow modification or access to sensitive pages might lack proper checks to ensure the user has the necessary permissions.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Flaws:** If the application implements RBAC, vulnerabilities could arise from:
    * **Incorrect Role Assignments:** Users might be assigned roles with overly broad permissions.
    * **Role Hierarchy Issues:**  The hierarchy of roles might be flawed, allowing lower-privileged users to access resources intended for higher-privileged users.
    * **Missing Checks on Role Assignment:**  Actions might not properly verify the user's current role before granting access.
* **Path Traversal/Manipulation:** Attackers might manipulate URLs or parameters to access pages or functionalities they shouldn't have access to. For example, modifying page names or paths to bypass authorization checks.
* **Session Management Issues:**
    * **Session Fixation:** Attackers can force a user to use a known session ID, allowing them to hijack the session later.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies through techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or network sniffing.
    * **Lack of Session Invalidation:** Sessions might not be properly invalidated upon logout or after a period of inactivity, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**4. Vulnerabilities in External Authentication Integration:**

* **OAuth/OpenID Connect Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configured OAuth or OpenID Connect flows can lead to authorization bypasses or information leakage. For example, improper handling of redirect URIs or access tokens.
* **LDAP Injection:** If the application uses LDAP for authentication and user input is not properly sanitized, attackers might inject malicious LDAP queries to bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive information.
* **SAML Vulnerabilities:**  Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the SAML implementation can allow attackers to forge authentication assertions.

**5. Custom Authentication/Authorization Logic Flaws:**

* **Logic Errors:** Flaws in the custom code implementing authentication or authorization can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
* **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Developers might inadvertently include hardcoded credentials in the code.
* **Insecure Cryptographic Practices:**  If custom encryption or hashing is used for passwords, weak algorithms or improper implementation can make them vulnerable to cracking.

**Detailed Impact Analysis:**

The impact of successful exploitation of authentication and authorization flaws can be severe:

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** Attackers could gain access to confidential wiki content, including internal documentation, project plans, or personal information shared within the wiki.
* **Modification or Deletion of Wiki Content:** Attackers could alter or delete important information, disrupting workflows, spreading misinformation, or causing reputational damage.
* **Account Takeover:** Attackers could gain complete control over user accounts, allowing them to perform actions as that user, including modifying content, accessing sensitive data, or potentially escalating privileges further.
* **Data Breaches:** Depending on the sensitivity of the information stored in the wiki, a successful attack could lead to a significant data breach, with legal and financial repercussions.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode trust with users and stakeholders.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, unauthorized access or data breaches could lead to compliance violations and significant fines.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the Gollum instance is connected to other internal systems, attackers could potentially use compromised accounts to move laterally within the network.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Expanding on the Initial Points):**

**Developers:**

* **Secure Authentication Mechanisms (Deep Dive):**
    * **Leverage Established Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted and actively maintained authentication libraries and frameworks (e.g., Passport.js for Node.js). Avoid rolling your own authentication logic unless absolutely necessary and with rigorous security review.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA wherever possible to add an extra layer of security beyond username and password.
    * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, expiration) and educate users about password security.
    * **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Implement mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting login attempts and locking accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.
    * **Secure Credential Storage:**  Hash passwords using strong, salted hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Never store passwords in plain text.
    * **Regularly Rotate API Keys and Secrets:** If the application integrates with external services using API keys, ensure these keys are regularly rotated and stored securely.

* **Proper Authorization Checks (Deep Dive):**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * **Centralized Authorization Logic:** Implement authorization checks in a consistent and centralized manner to avoid inconsistencies and oversights.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, LDAP injection).
    * **Secure Direct Object References:** Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs. Use indirect references or access control lists.
    * **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Choose an authorization model that aligns with the application's needs and implement it correctly.
    * **Regularly Review Access Controls:** Periodically review and update user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.
