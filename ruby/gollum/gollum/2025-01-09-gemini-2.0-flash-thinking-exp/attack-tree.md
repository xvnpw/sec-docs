## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Git Interaction -> Add Malicious Git Hook](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_git_interaction_-_add_malicious_git_hook.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker with write access to the Git repository can commit a file within the `.git/hooks` directory (e.g., `post-receive`). This file can contain arbitrary executable code. When a `git push` operation occurs, Git will execute this hook script on the server.
**Impact:** Successful execution of the malicious Git hook allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Git user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Add Malicious Git Hook](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_add_malicious_git_hook.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described above, this involves committing a malicious script to the `.git/hooks` directory.
**Impact:** This node is critical because it provides a persistent mechanism for arbitrary code execution on the server whenever a Git push occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Content Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_content_rendering_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Gollum utilizes a server-side templating engine (this is less common in core Gollum but possible with extensions or customizations), an attacker might be able to inject malicious template directives within the Markdown content of a wiki page. When the server renders this page, the templating engine will process the malicious directives, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
**Impact:** Successful SSTI allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Gollum process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  As described above, this involves injecting malicious template directives into user-controlled content.
**Impact:** This node is critical because it provides a direct path to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit File System Operations -> Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_file_system_operations_-_path_traversal.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft malicious links or file paths within wiki pages, using sequences like `../` to navigate to directories outside the intended Gollum repository. If Gollum does not properly sanitize these paths, it might allow access to arbitrary files on the server.
**Impact:** Successful path traversal can allow the attacker to read sensitive configuration files, application code, or other data, potentially revealing credentials or other vulnerabilities. In some cases, it might even allow overwriting critical system files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Path Traversal (if leads to sensitive file access)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_path_traversal__if_leads_to_sensitive_file_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described above, this involves manipulating file paths to access unintended locations.
**Impact:** This node becomes critical if the accessible files contain sensitive information or allow for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit File System Operations -> Arbitrary File Write](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_file_system_operations_-_arbitrary_file_write.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If Gollum has vulnerabilities in its file handling logic (e.g., during file uploads, attachments, or certain editing features), an attacker might be able to force Gollum to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
**Impact:** Successful arbitrary file write can allow the attacker to overwrite configuration files, inject malicious code into existing application files, or create new executable files (like web shells) for remote access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Arbitrary File Write](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_arbitrary_file_write.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described above, this involves exploiting vulnerabilities to write files to unintended locations.
**Impact:** This node is critical because it allows for direct modification of the server's file system, potentially leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Configuration Settings](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_configuration_settings.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gollum might have default or configurable settings that are insecure. For example, default administrative credentials, disabled authentication features, or overly permissive access controls. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or expose sensitive information.
**Impact:**  Exploiting insecure configuration settings can lead to bypassing authentication, gaining administrative privileges, or exposing sensitive data like API keys or database credentials. This can be a stepping stone for further, more damaging attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure Configuration Settings (if leads to privilege escalation or sensitive data exposure)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_configuration_settings__if_leads_to_privilege_escalation_or_sensitive_data_ex_229da5b8.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described above, this involves leveraging weak or default configurations.
**Impact:** This node is critical if the exploited misconfiguration directly leads to a significant increase in attacker privileges or the exposure of sensitive data that can be used for further attacks.
