## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal Attack Leading to Sensitive File Access in Gollum

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Path Traversal (if leads to sensitive file access)" attack path within a Gollum wiki application. This analysis is tailored for a development team to understand the mechanics, potential impact, and necessary mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Vector: Path Traversal**

Path traversal, also known as directory traversal, is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories located outside the application's intended root directory. This is achieved by manipulating file paths used by the application, often through the use of special character sequences like `../` (dot dot slash).

**How it Applies to Gollum:**

Gollum, being a Git-based wiki, stores its pages and assets as files within a Git repository. The application needs to access these files to render them for users. Potential areas where path traversal vulnerabilities could exist in Gollum include:

* **Page Access:**  If the application directly uses user-provided input (e.g., page names from URLs) to construct file paths without proper sanitization, an attacker could manipulate the path to access files outside the intended wiki directory.
* **Asset Inclusion (Images, Attachments):**  If Gollum allows users to link to or embed external files or assets, and the path to these assets is constructed based on user input, path traversal could be possible.
* **Configuration File Loading:**  While less likely to be directly user-influenced, vulnerabilities could exist if the application dynamically loads configuration files based on insufficiently validated paths.
* **Custom Theme/Plugin Loading:** If Gollum supports custom themes or plugins and their loading mechanism relies on user-provided paths, this could be an entry point.

**Detailed Analysis of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attacker Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious request containing a manipulated file path. This path will likely include `../` sequences to navigate up the directory structure from the expected location.

2. **Vulnerable Code Point:** This malicious input reaches a part of the Gollum codebase responsible for handling file access. This could be within the code that:
    * Resolves page names to file paths in the Git repository.
    * Handles requests for static assets like images.
    * Loads configuration or theme files.

3. **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The vulnerable code fails to adequately validate or sanitize the attacker-controlled file path. This means the `../` sequences are not stripped, escaped, or otherwise neutralized.

4. **File System Access:** The application uses the unsanitized path to access the file system. Due to the `../` sequences, the application navigates outside the intended directory.

5. **Sensitive File Access (Critical Condition):** This attack path becomes critical if the attacker successfully navigates to and accesses files containing sensitive information. Examples of such files in a Gollum context (or the underlying server) could include:
    * **`.git` directory:**  Access to the `.git` directory allows the attacker to download the entire repository history, potentially revealing past versions of sensitive content, credentials, or intellectual property.
    * **Configuration files:** Files containing database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive application settings.
    * **Server configuration files:** Files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if the application runs with sufficient privileges).
    * **Log files:**  Potentially containing information about user activity, errors, or system details.
    * **Other application files:**  Source code, temporary files, or backups that could aid in further exploitation.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

If the attacker successfully executes this path traversal and accesses sensitive files, the impact can be significant:

* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive wiki content, user data, or confidential information.
* **Credential Compromise:**  Access to database credentials or API keys could allow the attacker to compromise other systems.
* **Source Code Exposure:**  Revealing the application's source code can aid in identifying further vulnerabilities.
* **Server Compromise:**  In severe cases, accessing system files could lead to complete server takeover.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization using it.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions, especially if personal data is exposed.

**Gollum-Specific Considerations:**

* **Git Repository Structure:** Understanding how Gollum organizes files within the Git repository is crucial for identifying potential target paths for attackers.
* **Markdown Rendering:**  If the path traversal occurs during the rendering of Markdown content (e.g., when handling image links), the attacker might be able to inject malicious links that trigger file access.
* **Plugin/Extension Architecture:** If Gollum has a plugin or extension mechanism, vulnerabilities in these components could also lead to path traversal.
* **Server Configuration:** The underlying web server and operating system configuration play a role. Restricting file system permissions and using a web server with robust security features can help mitigate the risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack path from being exploited, the development team should implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Only allow a predefined set of safe characters in file paths and page names.
    * **Reject Malicious Sequences:**  Explicitly block sequences like `../`, `./`, and absolute paths.
    * **Canonicalization:**  Convert file paths to their canonical form (absolute path) to resolve symbolic links and eliminate redundant separators.
* **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * **Treat User Input as Untrusted:** Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths without thorough validation.
    * **Use Safe File Access APIs:** Employ secure file access functions provided by the programming language or framework that prevent traversal.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access files. Avoid running the application as root.
    * **Chroot Jails/Sandboxing:**  Consider using chroot jails or sandboxing techniques to restrict the application's access to specific directories.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use automated tools to scan the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
    * **Manual Code Reviews:**  Have experienced developers review the code, paying close attention to file handling logic.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration tests and identify vulnerabilities.
* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep Gollum and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
* **Error Handling:** Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Generic error messages are preferred.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests, including those attempting path traversal.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Even with preventative measures in place, it's important to have mechanisms for detecting and monitoring potential path traversal attempts:

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor application logs for suspicious patterns, such as requests containing `../` sequences or attempts to access unusual file paths.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS to detect and alert on path traversal attempts.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor critical files and directories for unauthorized changes.

**Developer Recommendations:**

* **Educate developers on the risks of path traversal vulnerabilities.**
* **Establish secure coding guidelines and best practices for file handling.**
* **Implement automated security testing as part of the development pipeline.**
* **Regularly review and update security measures.**
* **Consider using a framework or library that provides built-in protection against path traversal.**

**Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal (if leads to sensitive file access)" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications like Gollum. By understanding the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and protect sensitive information. A proactive and layered security approach, combining secure coding practices, thorough testing, and ongoing monitoring, is essential for maintaining the security of the Gollum wiki application.
