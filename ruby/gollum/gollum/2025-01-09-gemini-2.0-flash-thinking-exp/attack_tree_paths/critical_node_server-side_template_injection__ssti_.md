## Deep Analysis of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Gollum

This analysis delves into the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability within the context of the Gollum wiki application, focusing on the provided attack tree path.

**Understanding the Vulnerability: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

SSTI is a security vulnerability that arises when a web application embeds user-controlled input directly into a template engine. Instead of treating user input as pure data, the template engine interprets it as code. This allows attackers to inject malicious template directives that can be executed on the server, leading to severe consequences.

**Gollum Context:**

Gollum, being a Ruby-based wiki that uses Git for storage, likely utilizes a template engine for rendering wiki pages and other dynamic content. Common Ruby template engines include ERB (Embedded Ruby), Haml, and Slim. The specific engine used by Gollum will influence the exact syntax and exploitation techniques for SSTI.

**Analyzing the Attack Tree Path:**

**Critical Node: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

This node correctly identifies SSTI as a critical vulnerability. The potential for complete server compromise makes it a high-priority security concern.

**Attack Vector: Injecting malicious template directives into user-controlled content.**

This description accurately captures the core mechanism of SSTI. The key lies in identifying where user input is processed and passed to the template engine without proper sanitization or escaping. Possible injection points in Gollum could include:

* **Wiki Page Content:** This is the most obvious and likely vector. Users can edit wiki pages using Markdown or potentially other markup languages. If Gollum uses a template engine to render this content, malicious template directives embedded within the Markdown could be executed.
    * **Example (assuming ERB):**  A user could insert `<%= system('whoami') %>` within a wiki page. If not properly escaped, the ERB engine would execute the `whoami` command on the server.
* **Custom Macros or Extensions:** If Gollum supports custom macros or extensions that are rendered using a template engine, these could be vulnerable.
* **User Profile Information:**  Fields like "About Me" or other customizable profile sections could be exploited if they are rendered using a template engine.
* **Configuration Settings:**  While less likely for direct user control, if certain configuration settings are dynamically rendered using a template engine, they could be a potential vector.
* **Git Commit Messages (less likely but possible):** If Gollum displays or processes Git commit messages in a way that involves template rendering, there's a theoretical possibility of injecting malicious directives through commit messages.

**Impact: This node is critical because it provides a direct path to arbitrary code execution on the server.**

This assessment of the impact is accurate and highlights the severity of SSTI. Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to:

* **Gain complete control of the server:**  They can execute any command the web application's user has permissions for.
* **Read sensitive data:** Access configuration files, database credentials, other application data, and potentially even data from other users.
* **Modify or delete data:**  Alter wiki content, user accounts, or even system files.
* **Install malware or backdoors:** Establish persistent access to the server.
* **Pivot to other internal systems:** If the server has network access, the attacker can use it as a stepping stone to compromise other systems within the network.
* **Cause a denial of service (DoS):**  Execute resource-intensive commands to crash the server.

**Deep Dive into Potential Vulnerabilities in Gollum:**

To understand how SSTI might manifest in Gollum, we need to consider its architecture and functionality:

* **Template Engine Usage:**  Identifying the specific template engine used by Gollum is crucial. If it's ERB, the common injection points will involve `<%= ... %>` for executing Ruby code or `<% ... %>` for control flow. Other engines will have their own syntax.
* **Markdown Rendering:** Gollum likely uses a Markdown parser to convert wiki content to HTML. The interaction between the Markdown parser and the template engine is critical. If user-provided Markdown is directly passed to the template engine *after* Markdown processing, there's a high risk of SSTI.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The primary cause of SSTI is the failure to properly sanitize or escape user input before it's passed to the template engine. This means treating user input as code instead of data.
* **Contextual Escaping:** Even if some escaping is performed, it might not be sufficient for the specific context of the template engine. For example, HTML escaping might prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) but not SSTI.
* **Custom Helpers or Functions:** If Gollum provides custom template helpers or functions that interact with the underlying system, these could be exploited through SSTI to achieve code execution.

**Exploitation Scenario (Assuming ERB and Markdown):**

1. **Attacker Edits a Wiki Page:** The attacker navigates to a wiki page they have permission to edit.
2. **Malicious Payload Injection:** The attacker inserts the following malicious payload into the page content:
   ```markdown
   This is some normal content.

   <%= system('cat /etc/passwd') %>

   More normal content.
   ```
3. **Gollum Processes the Page:** When the page is saved or viewed, Gollum's backend processes the Markdown.
4. **Template Engine Execution:** If the Markdown output is directly passed to the ERB template engine without proper escaping, the `<%= system('cat /etc/passwd') %>` directive will be interpreted as Ruby code.
5. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `system('cat /etc/passwd')` command will be executed on the server, and the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file will be included in the rendered HTML output.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent SSTI vulnerabilities in Gollum, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Sanitization and Escaping:**
    * **Treat User Input as Untrusted:** Always assume user input is malicious.
    * **Context-Aware Escaping:** Escape user input based on the specific context where it will be used (HTML, JavaScript, template engine syntax).
    * **Avoid Direct Inclusion:**  Never directly embed user input into template code without proper escaping.
* **Templating Engine Security:**
    * **Use "Safe" or "Sandboxed" Modes:** If the chosen template engine offers a secure or sandboxed mode, utilize it. This restricts the functionality available within templates.
    * **Restrict Template Functionality:** Limit the use of powerful or potentially dangerous template features.
    * **Consider a Logic-Less Templating Engine:** If possible, consider using a logic-less templating engine that primarily focuses on presentation and avoids code execution within templates.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI attacks by limiting the resources the browser can load and execute.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including SSTI.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web application process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of code execution.
* **Framework-Level Protections:** If Gollum is built upon a web framework, leverage any built-in security features designed to prevent SSTI.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of SSTI vulnerabilities and best practices for preventing them.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Identify the Template Engine:** Determine which template engine Gollum is currently using. This is the first step towards understanding the specific risks and mitigation strategies.
2. **Review Code for Template Usage:** Carefully examine the codebase to identify all instances where user-provided content is rendered using the template engine.
3. **Implement Robust Input Sanitization/Escaping:**  Prioritize implementing context-aware escaping for all user input that is passed to the template engine.
4. **Explore Template Engine Security Features:** Investigate if the current template engine offers safe modes or ways to restrict functionality.
5. **Conduct Security Testing:** Perform targeted penetration testing specifically focused on identifying potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
6. **Consider Security Libraries:** Explore using security libraries or frameworks that can help automate input sanitization and escaping.
