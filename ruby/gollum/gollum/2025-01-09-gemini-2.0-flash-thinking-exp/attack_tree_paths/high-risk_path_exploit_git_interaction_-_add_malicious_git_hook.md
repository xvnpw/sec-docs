## Deep Analysis: Add Malicious Git Hook Attack Path in Gollum

This analysis delves into the "Add Malicious Git Hook" attack path identified for a Gollum application, providing a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its implications, and recommendations for mitigation.

**Attack Tree Path:** High-Risk Path: Exploit Git Interaction -> Add Malicious Git Hook

**1. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

* **Initial Condition:** The attacker has gained write access to the underlying Git repository that Gollum uses to store its wiki pages. This access could be obtained through various means, including:
    * **Compromised Credentials:**  Stealing or guessing credentials of a user with write access to the repository (e.g., through phishing, brute-force attacks, or leaked credentials).
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Git Hosting Platform:** If the repository is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution, vulnerabilities in that platform could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate write access could intentionally introduce the malicious hook.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions:**  Incorrectly set permissions on the Git repository or its hosting environment could allow unauthorized write access.

* **Attack Action: Adding the Malicious Git Hook:** Once write access is obtained, the attacker proceeds to add a malicious executable script within the `.git/hooks` directory.
    * **Target Directory:** The `.git/hooks` directory is a special directory within the Git repository where scripts can be placed to execute at specific points during the Git workflow.
    * **Hook Types:**  Various hook types exist, each triggered by a different Git action. The example provided, `post-receive`, is a common and effective choice for this attack.
        * **`post-receive`:** This hook executes on the server *after* a successful `git push` operation. This makes it ideal for immediate execution of malicious code upon a legitimate code update.
        * **Other Potential Hooks:**  Other hooks like `pre-receive` (executed before accepting a push) or `post-commit` (executed after a local commit) could also be used depending on the attacker's goals and the environment.
    * **Content of the Malicious Hook:** The script can be written in any language that the server can execute (e.g., Bash, Python, Perl). It can contain arbitrary commands designed to achieve the attacker's objectives. Examples include:
        * **Reverse Shell:** Establishing a connection back to the attacker's machine, granting them interactive command-line access to the server.
        * **Data Exfiltration:** Copying sensitive data from the server to an external location.
        * **System Modification:** Creating new user accounts, modifying system configurations, or installing malware.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Consuming system resources to make the server unavailable.
        * **Persistence Mechanisms:**  Creating backdoors or scheduled tasks to maintain access even if the initial hook is removed.
    * **Method of Addition:** The attacker can add the hook through a standard `git commit` and `git push` operation. They would create the script file within the `.git/hooks` directory (e.g., `.git/hooks/post-receive`), make it executable, and then push the changes to the remote repository.

* **Trigger Event: `git push` Operation:** The malicious hook remains dormant until a `git push` operation occurs on the server. This could be triggered by:
    * **Legitimate User Activity:** A developer pushing legitimate changes to the Gollum wiki.
    * **Automated Processes:**  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines pushing updates.
    * **Attacker-Initiated Push:** The attacker themselves pushing a benign commit to trigger their malicious hook.

* **Execution of the Malicious Hook:** When the `git push` event occurs, the Git server executes the script located at `.git/hooks/post-receive` (or whichever hook was added).
    * **Execution Context:** The script will execute with the privileges of the user account that the Git server process runs under. This is typically a dedicated user for Git operations but could potentially have broader system access depending on the server configuration.
    * **Silent Execution:**  The execution of the hook might not be immediately apparent to users or administrators unless proper monitoring is in place.

**2. Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Git Hooks Mechanism:** Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful feature for automating tasks and enforcing workflows. However, this power can be abused if write access to the `.git` directory is compromised.
* **Executable Permissions:**  For a Git hook to execute, it must have executable permissions set (e.g., `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive`). This is a crucial step for the attacker.
* **Server-Side Execution:**  The key aspect of this attack is that the malicious code executes on the *server* hosting the Git repository, not on the client machine performing the push. This allows the attacker to directly compromise the server environment.
* **Importance of `.git` Directory:** The `.git` directory is the core of a Git repository, containing all the version history, configuration, and hooks. Securing this directory is paramount.
* **Potential for Persistence:**  Once the malicious hook is in place, it can provide persistent access for the attacker. Even if the initial vulnerability that granted write access is patched, the hook will continue to execute on every subsequent `git push`.

**3. Impact Assessment:**

The successful execution of a malicious Git hook can have severe consequences, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Gollum server and its associated data.

* **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the server by executing commands with the privileges of the Git user. This allows them to install further malware, create backdoors, and manipulate system configurations.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data stored on the server, including Gollum wiki content, configuration files, and potentially other application data, can be accessed and exfiltrated.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious hook can be designed to consume system resources, causing the server to become unresponsive and denying service to legitimate users.
* **Manipulation of Gollum Wiki Content:** The attacker could modify or delete wiki pages, inject malicious content, or deface the Gollum application.
* **Lateral Movement:**  If the compromised server is part of a larger network, the attacker could use it as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization hosting the Gollum application.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery from such an attack can be costly, involving incident response, system restoration, and potential legal liabilities.

**4. Detection Strategies:**

Identifying the presence of malicious Git hooks requires proactive monitoring and security measures.

* **Regular Auditing of `.git/hooks` Directory:**  Periodically inspect the contents of the `.git/hooks` directory for unexpected or suspicious files.
* **Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized changes to files within the `.git` directory, including hook scripts.
* **Logging and Monitoring of Git Operations:**  Monitor Git server logs for unusual activity, such as commits or pushes made by unauthorized users or at unusual times.
* **Process Monitoring:**  Observe running processes on the server for any suspicious activity triggered after a `git push` operation.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Git server logs and system logs into a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential attacks.
* **Code Review of Hook Scripts:** If custom Git hooks are legitimately used, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
* **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):** Monitor user activity for deviations from normal behavior that might indicate compromised accounts.

**5. Prevention Strategies:**

Preventing this attack requires a multi-layered security approach focusing on access control and security best practices.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant write access to the Git repository only to users who absolutely need it.
* **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and robust access control mechanisms for the Git repository.
* **Secure Git Hosting Platform:** Utilize reputable and secure Git hosting platforms with built-in security features. Keep the platform software updated.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Git repository, server configurations, and access controls.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (if applicable):** While not directly related to hook execution, ensure that any user input that might influence Git operations is properly validated and sanitized to prevent other types of attacks.
* **Disable Unnecessary Git Features:** If certain Git features are not required, consider disabling them to reduce the attack surface.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Git server and the Gollum application within a secure network segment to limit the impact of a potential breach.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and administrators about the risks associated with compromised Git repositories and the importance of secure coding practices.
* **Implement Git Hook Management Tools:** Some tools can help manage and control the execution of Git hooks, potentially preventing the introduction of malicious ones.
* **Consider Read-Only Access for Most Users:** For users who primarily consume the wiki content, consider granting them read-only access to the Git repository.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (If Compromised):**

If a malicious Git hook is detected, immediate action is required to contain the damage and restore the system.

* **Isolate the Affected Server:** Disconnect the compromised server from the network to prevent further spread of the attack.
* **Identify and Analyze the Malicious Hook:** Examine the contents of the malicious hook script to understand its purpose and the extent of the compromise.
* **Remove the Malicious Hook:** Delete the malicious script from the `.git/hooks` directory.
* **Review Git Logs:** Analyze Git logs to identify the user who added the malicious hook and any other suspicious activity.
* **Scan for Malware:** Perform a thorough malware scan on the compromised server and any potentially affected systems.
* **Change Passwords and Revoke Access:**  Change passwords for all accounts with access to the Git repository and revoke any suspicious access tokens or SSH keys.
* **Restore from Backups:** If necessary, restore the server and the Git repository from clean backups.
* **Incident Response:** Follow a defined incident response plan to document the incident, analyze the root cause, and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
* **Notify Relevant Parties:** Inform stakeholders, including users and potentially legal authorities, about the security breach.

**7. Specific Considerations for Gollum:**

* **Sensitivity of Wiki Content:**  Assess the sensitivity of the information stored in the Gollum wiki. A successful attack could expose confidential data.
* **User Base:**  Consider the number of users with write access to the Gollum repository. A larger number of contributors increases the risk of a compromised account.
* **Integration with Other Systems:** Determine if the Gollum server interacts with other internal systems. A compromised server could provide a foothold for further attacks.
* **Backup and Recovery Procedures:** Ensure robust backup and recovery procedures are in place for the Gollum wiki data.

**Conclusion:**

The "Add Malicious Git Hook" attack path presents a significant security risk for Gollum applications. By gaining write access to the underlying Git repository, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. A proactive security approach, including strong access controls, regular monitoring, and robust incident response procedures, is crucial to mitigate this threat. Development teams must be aware of the risks associated with Git interaction and implement appropriate security measures to protect their Gollum deployments.
