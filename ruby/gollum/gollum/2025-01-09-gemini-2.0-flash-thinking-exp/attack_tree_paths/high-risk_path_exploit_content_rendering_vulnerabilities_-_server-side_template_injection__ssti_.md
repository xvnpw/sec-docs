## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Gollum

This analysis delves into the potential Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attack path within a Gollum-based application, as outlined in the provided attack tree. While core Gollum itself doesn't inherently utilize a server-side templating engine for rendering Markdown content, this analysis explores the scenario where such an engine is introduced through extensions, customizations, or a layer built on top of Gollum.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The attack path "Exploit Content Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)" highlights a critical point of weakness: the process of transforming user-provided content (Markdown in this case) into the final HTML displayed to the user. If a server-side templating engine is involved in this rendering process, and user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being processed by the engine, it creates an opportunity for SSTI.

**Deep Dive into Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**

SSTI occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a template that is then processed by the server-side templating engine. These engines are designed to dynamically generate web pages by embedding variables and logic within templates. If user-controlled input is directly included in the template without proper sanitization, the attacker can manipulate the template logic to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Why is SSTI Dangerous?**

Unlike client-side injection attacks (like Cross-Site Scripting - XSS), SSTI executes directly on the server. This grants the attacker significant control and access, potentially leading to:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most severe consequence. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Gollum process. This allows them to:
    * **Install malware:**  Compromise the server further.
    * **Access and exfiltrate sensitive data:**  Steal confidential information stored on the server or accessible by it.
    * **Modify data:**  Alter wiki content, configuration files, or other critical information.
    * **Create new users or elevate privileges:**  Gain persistent access to the system.
    * **Launch further attacks:**  Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crash the server or consume its resources.
* **Information Disclosure:** Even without full RCE, the attacker might be able to access sensitive server-side information by manipulating the template logic to reveal environment variables, configuration details, or internal application data.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The attacker could potentially use the server to make requests to internal or external resources that are otherwise inaccessible to them.

**Gollum-Specific Considerations and Likelihood:**

As the analysis correctly points out, core Gollum doesn't inherently use a server-side templating engine for rendering Markdown. It typically relies on libraries like `github/markup` or similar for this process. However, the risk of SSTI arises in the following scenarios:

1. **Custom Extensions or Plugins:** If the Gollum instance has been extended with custom plugins or features that introduce a server-side templating engine to handle specific content types or functionalities, this becomes a potential attack vector. For example, a plugin that allows embedding dynamic content using Jinja2 or similar engines could be vulnerable.
2. **Layered Applications:** If Gollum is integrated into a larger web application framework that utilizes a server-side templating engine (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask) and user-provided Markdown content is passed through this framework's templating engine before being rendered, SSTI becomes a possibility.
3. **Misconfigured or Vulnerable Markup Libraries:** While less likely to lead directly to full SSTI, vulnerabilities in the underlying markup libraries could potentially be chained with other weaknesses to achieve similar outcomes.
4. **Developer Error in Custom Rendering Logic:** If developers have implemented custom logic for rendering Markdown that inadvertently introduces vulnerabilities similar to those found in templating engines, SSTI-like attacks could be possible.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

1. **Attacker Identifies a Potential Entry Point:** The attacker needs to find a place where they can inject malicious code into the Markdown content of a wiki page. This could be through:
    * **Creating a new page:**  Directly injecting the payload during page creation.
    * **Editing an existing page:**  Modifying the Markdown content of an existing page.
    * **Exploiting other vulnerabilities:**  Using another vulnerability to inject the payload into the page content.

2. **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a payload that leverages the syntax of the server-side templating engine being used. This payload aims to execute arbitrary code when the template is rendered. The specific syntax will depend on the templating engine (e.g., Jinja2, Twig, Freemarker). Examples of potential payloads:

    * **Jinja2 (Python):** `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[406]('whoami', shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip() }}` (This is a common bypass for accessing system commands)
    * **Twig (PHP):** `{{ _self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system") }}{{ _self.env.getFilter("id") }}`
    * **Freemarker (Java):** `<#assign ex = "freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>${ex("id")}>`

3. **Injecting the Payload:** The attacker submits the crafted Markdown content containing the malicious payload to the Gollum application.

4. **Server-Side Processing and Rendering:** When a user (or the attacker themselves) attempts to view the page containing the malicious payload, the following happens:
    * Gollum retrieves the Markdown content.
    * **Crucially, if a server-side templating engine is involved:** The Markdown content is processed by the templating engine.
    * The templating engine interprets the injected payload as template directives and executes them.

5. **Code Execution and Impact:** The malicious payload executes on the server with the privileges of the Gollum process. This allows the attacker to perform the actions outlined in the "Impact" section.

**Detection Strategies:**

Identifying potential SSTI vulnerabilities requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the codebase, especially any custom extensions, plugins, or rendering logic, looking for instances where user-provided content is directly passed to a server-side templating engine without proper sanitization or escaping.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the source code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities based on known patterns and rules.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools that can automatically probe the application by injecting various payloads into input fields (including wiki page content) and observing the server's response for signs of SSTI.
* **Manual Penetration Testing:** Engage security experts to perform manual penetration testing, specifically targeting potential SSTI vulnerabilities. This often involves crafting specific payloads tailored to the application's architecture.
* **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Regularly audit and update all dependencies, including any server-side templating engines used, to ensure they are patched against known vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization measures on the server-side to prevent malicious characters and code from being processed by the templating engine. This includes escaping special characters relevant to the templating engine's syntax.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for SSTI, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful exploitation by limiting the resources the attacker can load and execute.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing SSTI is paramount. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Avoid Using Server-Side Templating Engines for User-Provided Content:** If possible, avoid using server-side templating engines to render user-provided content like Markdown. Rely on secure Markdown rendering libraries that do not interpret template directives.
* **Strict Input Sanitization and Escaping:** If a templating engine is necessary, rigorously sanitize and escape all user-provided input before it is processed by the engine. This involves converting potentially harmful characters into a safe representation. The specific escaping methods will depend on the templating engine being used.
* **Use Logic-less Templating Engines:** Consider using logic-less templating engines that offer limited functionality and reduce the attack surface.
* **Sandbox the Templating Engine:** If the templating engine supports sandboxing, configure it to restrict the capabilities of the template execution environment, limiting access to sensitive resources and functions.
* **Disable or Restrict Dangerous Functions:** Many templating engines offer features that allow executing arbitrary code. Disable or restrict access to these dangerous functions if they are not essential for the application's functionality.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Gollum process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful SSTI attack.
* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Gollum and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF that can detect and block common SSTI payloads. However, WAFs should not be the sole line of defense.

**Defense in Depth:**

A robust security posture relies on a defense-in-depth approach. Implement multiple layers of security controls to reduce the risk of successful exploitation. This includes combining the detection and mitigation strategies mentioned above.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Thoroughly investigate if any server-side templating engines are currently in use within the Gollum application, including custom extensions or integrations.**
* **If a templating engine is used for rendering user-provided content, prioritize migrating to a safer approach that avoids direct processing of user input by the engine.**
* **Implement robust input sanitization and escaping for all user-provided content before it reaches any templating engine.**
* **Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting potential SSTI vulnerabilities.**
* **Educate developers on the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices related to templating engines.**
* **Establish a process for promptly addressing and patching any identified vulnerabilities.**

**Conclusion:**

While core Gollum might not be inherently susceptible to SSTI, the possibility arises when server-side templating engines are introduced through extensions, customizations, or layered architectures. This attack path poses a significant risk due to the potential for remote code execution and complete system compromise. By understanding the mechanics of SSTI, implementing robust detection and mitigation strategies, and adopting a defense-in-depth approach, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability. A proactive and vigilant approach to security is essential to protect the Gollum application and the sensitive data it manages.
