## Deep Analysis: Add Malicious Git Hook Attack on Gollum

This analysis delves into the attack path "Add Malicious Git Hook" within the context of a Gollum application. We will examine the mechanics, impact, detection, and prevention strategies for this critical vulnerability.

**Critical Node: Add Malicious Git Hook**

**Attack Vector:**  As described above, this involves committing a malicious script to the `.git/hooks` directory.

**Impact:** This node is critical because it provides a persistent mechanism for arbitrary code execution on the server whenever a Git push occurs.

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

**1. Understanding Git Hooks:**

* **Functionality:** Git hooks are scripts that Git executes automatically before or after events like commits, pushes, merges, etc. They reside within the `.git/hooks` directory of a Git repository.
* **Types of Hooks:**  Common hooks include `pre-commit`, `post-commit`, `pre-push`, `post-receive`, etc. The specific hook targeted in this attack is likely a server-side hook, such as `post-receive` or `post-update`, which are triggered when changes are pushed to the server.
* **Execution Context:** These scripts are executed on the server in the context of the Git user. This means they have the same permissions as the user running the Git process. If the Git process runs with elevated privileges (which is often the case in server environments), the malicious hook can perform highly privileged actions.

**2. Mechanics of the Attack:**

* **Gaining Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the Git repository's `.git/hooks` directory. This could be achieved through various means:
    * **Compromised Developer Account:**  The most likely scenario. If an attacker gains access to a developer's account with push privileges, they can directly modify the repository.
    * **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Gollum's Git Handling:**  While less likely for this specific attack path, vulnerabilities in how Gollum handles Git operations could potentially allow unauthorized modifications.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access could intentionally plant the hook.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions:**  Incorrect file system permissions on the server could allow unauthorized users to modify the `.git/hooks` directory.
* **Crafting the Malicious Hook:** The attacker will create a script (e.g., Bash, Python, Perl) containing malicious code. This script will be designed to execute upon a Git push event.
* **Choosing the Target Hook:** The attacker will choose a hook that is triggered by the desired event. For persistent code execution upon every push, `post-receive` or `post-update` are ideal candidates.
* **Adding Execute Permissions:**  The attacker needs to ensure the malicious script has execute permissions (`chmod +x <hook_name>`).
* **Committing and Pushing:** The attacker commits the malicious hook file and pushes the changes to the remote repository.
* **Triggering the Attack:**  Once the changes are pushed to the server, the Git server will execute the malicious hook script during the `post-receive` or `post-update` process.

**3. Impact Assessment:**

This attack path has a **critical** impact due to the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The consequences can be severe and include:

* **Data Breach:** The malicious script can access sensitive data stored on the server, including Gollum's wiki content, configuration files, and potentially other application data or system credentials.
* **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control of the server by executing commands to create backdoors, install malware, or escalate privileges.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious script could consume system resources, crash the Gollum application, or disrupt other services running on the server.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete wiki content, potentially causing significant information loss or spreading misinformation.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the Gollum instance is used in a development or deployment pipeline, the malicious hook could be used to inject malicious code into downstream systems or applications.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization hosting the Gollum instance.

**4. Detection Strategies:**

Detecting this type of attack can be challenging, especially if the attacker is sophisticated. However, several strategies can be employed:

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Tools like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, or even simple scripts can monitor the `.git/hooks` directory for unauthorized modifications. Changes to existing hook files or the addition of new ones should trigger alerts.
* **Log Analysis:**
    * **Git Logs:** Examine Git logs on the server for unusual commits modifying the `.git/hooks` directory. Look for commits made by unexpected users or at unusual times.
    * **System Logs:** Monitor system logs for unusual process execution originating from the Git user or the `.git/hooks` directory. Look for unexpected network connections or file access patterns.
    * **Web Server Logs:** If the malicious hook interacts with the web server or external resources, relevant entries might appear in web server logs.
* **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the contents of the `.git/hooks` directory to ensure only authorized and reviewed scripts are present.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**  Monitor system behavior for unusual activity after Git pushes. This could include spikes in CPU or memory usage, unexpected network traffic, or the creation of new processes.
* **Honeypots:** Deploying decoy files or services that are likely targets of malicious activity can help detect successful exploitation of the hook.

**5. Prevention Strategies:**

Proactive measures are crucial to prevent this attack:

* **Strong Access Control:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Git push access only to authorized developers who need it.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all developer accounts to reduce the risk of account compromise.
    * **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access to the Git repository.
* **Code Review for Hooks:** Treat Git hooks as code and subject them to the same rigorous code review process as other application code. This helps identify potentially malicious or poorly written scripts.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Even for Hooks):** While less common, if hooks process external input, ensure proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks within the hook itself.
* **Secure Server Configuration:**
    * **Restrict Permissions:** Ensure the Git user has the minimum necessary permissions to operate. Avoid running Git processes with root privileges.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Hooks:** If certain hooks are not required, disable them to reduce the attack surface.
    * **Regularly Update Git:** Keep the Git server software up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Scanning:** Regularly scan the server and the Gollum application for vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain write access to the repository.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure where changes to the server are infrequent and require a formal deployment process, making unauthorized modifications more difficult.
* **Containerization:** Running Gollum within a container can provide an additional layer of isolation and control over the execution environment.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers about the risks associated with malicious Git hooks and best practices for secure Git usage.
* **Git Hook Management Tools:** Explore tools that can help manage and enforce policies around Git hooks, potentially restricting the ability to add or modify them without proper authorization.

**6. Gollum-Specific Considerations:**

* **Content as Git Commits:** Gollum stores wiki content as Git commits. This makes the Git repository a critical component, and any compromise of the Git process has direct implications for the integrity of the wiki content.
* **Potential for Automation:**  Gollum's interaction with Git could be leveraged by a malicious hook to automate further attacks or exfiltration of data.

**7. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Security:** Make security a core consideration in the development and deployment process.
* **Implement Strong Access Controls:**  Enforce strict access controls for the Git repository and the server hosting Gollum.
* **Establish a Code Review Process for Hooks:**  Implement a mandatory review process for all Git hooks.
* **Utilize File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement FIM on the server, specifically monitoring the `.git/hooks` directory.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Gollum installation and the underlying server infrastructure.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches, including those involving malicious Git hooks.
* **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities related to Git and web applications.

**Conclusion:**

The "Add Malicious Git Hook" attack path represents a significant security risk for Gollum applications due to its potential for persistent and highly privileged code execution. Understanding the mechanics of this attack, implementing robust prevention strategies, and establishing effective detection mechanisms are crucial for protecting the integrity and security of the Gollum instance and the underlying server. By working collaboratively, the development team and cybersecurity experts can mitigate this risk and ensure a more secure environment.
