# Threat Model Analysis for gollum/gollum

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within Markdown content. When this content is rendered by Gollum and viewed by other users, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites. They would achieve this by crafting Markdown with embedded `<script>` tags or event handlers within HTML elements.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of wiki pages, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:** Markdown Rendering Engine (the part responsible for converting Markdown to HTML).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding when rendering Markdown.
        *   Utilize a security-focused Markdown rendering library or configure Gollum's rendering engine to prevent the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Uploads/Attachments](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_uploadsattachments.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Uploads/Attachments
    *   **Description:** If Gollum allows file uploads or attachments, an attacker could craft filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`). When these files are processed or stored by Gollum, it could lead to overwriting or accessing sensitive files on the server's filesystem. The attacker would upload files with maliciously crafted names.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, information disclosure, data corruption, arbitrary file read/write.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:** File Upload/Attachment Handling (if implemented within Gollum).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of uploaded filenames, removing or replacing path traversal sequences.
        *   Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the webroot with unique, non-guessable filenames.
        *   Avoid directly serving uploaded files; instead, serve them through a controlled endpoint that enforces access controls and prevents direct file system access.

## Threat: [Git Command Injection (if custom integrations exist *within Gollum*)](./threats/git_command_injection__if_custom_integrations_exist_within_gollum_.md)

*   **Threat:** Git Command Injection (if custom integrations exist *within Gollum*)
    *   **Description:** If Gollum itself exposes any functionality that directly executes Git commands based on user input (e.g., through a custom plugin *within Gollum*), an attacker could potentially inject malicious Git commands. They would manipulate input fields or parameters that are passed to Git commands *by Gollum*.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server, data manipulation in the Git repository.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:** Any custom integration or plugin *within Gollum* that executes Git commands based on user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly exposing Git command execution based on user input *within Gollum's core or plugins*.
        *   If absolutely necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all user input before passing it to Git commands *within Gollum*.
        *   Use parameterized commands where possible to prevent injection.
        *   Run Git commands with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Insecure Gollum Configuration](./threats/insecure_gollum_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Gollum Configuration
    *   **Description:** Misconfiguration of Gollum settings, such as weak authentication or authorization mechanisms, could expose the wiki to unauthorized access or manipulation. This could involve default credentials, overly permissive access rules, or disabled security features *within Gollum's own settings*. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to gain access or control.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of content, account compromise, potential server compromise.
    *   **Affected Gollum Component:** Configuration System, Authentication and Authorization Modules *within Gollum*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring Gollum, ensuring strong authentication and authorization are enabled and properly configured.
        *   Change default credentials immediately.
        *   Regularly review and update Gollum's configuration based on security recommendations.
        *   Restrict access to the Gollum configuration files.
