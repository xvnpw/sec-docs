*   **Threat:** Insecure Route Definition leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft a URL by exploiting overly permissive route definitions (e.g., using broad wildcards) to access API endpoints or resources they are not intended to access. They might try to bypass intended access controls by manipulating the URL structure. This directly involves how Grape's routing DSL is used.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of resources without proper authorization, potential execution of unintended actions.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `Grape::API::Instance#route` (the routing DSL and mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with specific paths and avoid overly broad wildcards.
        *   Regularly review route definitions to ensure they align with intended access controls.
        *   Use specific HTTP method constraints on routes.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Parameter Validation leading to Backend Exploits
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send malicious or unexpected data through API parameters if Grape's parameter validation is insufficient or bypassed. This directly involves how Grape's validation features are used (or not used).
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, unauthorized data access, potential for remote code execution in backend systems.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `Grape::Validations` (the module responsible for defining and executing parameter validations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Grape's built-in validation features extensively to define expected parameter types, formats, and constraints.
        *   Implement custom validators for complex validation logic.
        *   Sanitize and validate data again in the backend systems as a defense-in-depth measure.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability via Parameter Passthrough
    *   **Description:** While Grape doesn't directly handle model persistence, if developers directly pass the `params` hash (or parts of it) obtained through Grape to backend model creation or update methods without proper filtering, an attacker could inject unexpected parameters to modify model attributes they shouldn't have access to. This directly involves how data processed by Grape is used.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data in the backend database or data store.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `Grape::Request#params` (the source of the potentially unfiltered parameters).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly pass the entire `params` hash to model creation or update methods.
        *   Use strong parameter filtering techniques (e.g., whitelisting allowed attributes) in the backend layer.
        *   Define specific data transfer objects (DTOs) or parameter objects to control which data is passed to the backend.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass due to Flawed Grape Helpers
    *   **Description:** If custom authentication helpers or strategies within Grape are implemented with vulnerabilities (e.g., incorrect token verification, insecure storage of credentials), an attacker could bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access. This directly involves custom code integrated with Grape's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Custom authentication logic implemented using `before` filters or custom helper methods within Grape APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom authentication logic for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for credential handling and token management.
        *   Consider using well-established and vetted authentication libraries or strategies.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Flaws within Grape Endpoints
    *   **Description:** If authorization checks within Grape endpoints are implemented incorrectly or are missing, an attacker might be able to access or modify resources they are not authorized to interact with. This directly involves how authorization logic is implemented within Grape's endpoint definitions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of resources without proper permissions, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Authorization logic implemented within Grape endpoint actions or using `before` filters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization logic to ensure it functions as intended.
