# Attack Surface Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Your application relies on external libraries (gems) which may contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems is the primary mechanism for managing and installing these dependencies, facilitating the inclusion of potentially vulnerable code.
    * **Example:** Your application depends on an older version of the `nokogiri` gem which has a known vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, etc.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update dependencies using `bundle update`.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools like `bundler-audit` or Snyk.
        * Pin dependency versions in your `Gemfile`.
        * Review dependency changelogs and security advisories.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Gems](./attack_surfaces/malicious_gems.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can publish malicious gems containing backdoors, malware, or code designed to steal sensitive information.
    * **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems.org is the central repository, a potential distribution point for malicious code.
    * **Example:** An attacker publishes a typosquatted gem that steals environment variables upon installation.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, data theft, introduction of backdoors.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify gem sources, primarily using the official rubygems.org.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to detect potentially malicious gems.
        * Be cautious with new or unfamiliar gems, researching their reputation.
        * Implement code reviews for critical dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Gem Sources](./attack_surfaces/compromised_gem_sources.md)

* **Description:** If the gem source (rubygems.org or a private server) is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into legitimate gems or distribute malicious gems.
    * **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems relies on these sources to fetch and install gems.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a maintainer's account on rubygems.org and pushes a compromised version of a popular gem.
    * **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malicious code, affecting many applications.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely on trusted sources, primarily rubygems.org.
        * Secure private gem servers with strong authentication and access controls.
        * Monitor gem sources for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Gem Content](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_gem_content.md)

* **Description:** Gems might contain vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary code execution when their code is loaded or used.
    * **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems distributes the code that can contain these vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A gem contains a function that unsafely deserializes user-provided data, allowing code injection.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Perform code reviews of dependencies, especially critical ones.
        * Follow secure coding practices in your own application.
        * Report discovered vulnerabilities to gem maintainers.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusion.md)

* **Description:** Attackers publish public gems with the same name as internal gems, hoping your build process uses the malicious public version.
    * **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems resolves dependencies based on name, potentially prioritizing a public gem with the same name.
    * **Example:** An attacker publishes a public gem named the same as your internal `my-company-utils` gem, which gets installed by mistake.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use namespaced gem names for internal gems.
        * Utilize private gem servers for internal gems.
        * Implement dependency checking tools.
        * Strictly control gem sources in your configuration.
