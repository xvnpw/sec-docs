# Threat Model Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Threat: [Vulnerability in `gem install` leading to arbitrary code execution](./threats/vulnerability_in__gem_install__leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability in `gem install` leading to arbitrary code execution
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `gem install` command or the gem installation process (within the `rubygems/rubygems` codebase) that allows an attacker to craft a malicious gem which, when installed, executes arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the command. This could involve insecure handling of gem extensions or vulnerabilities in the unpacking or processing of gem files.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine or the server where the gem is being installed, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gem install` command, gem extension handling within `rubygems/rubygems`, gem file processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RubyGems updated to the latest version, as security vulnerabilities are often patched in new releases.
        *   Run `gem install` commands with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Utilize tools that scan gems for potential malicious content before installation (though this is not a direct mitigation for vulnerabilities within `rubygems/rubygems` itself).
        *   Be cautious about installing gems from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in gem signature verification](./threats/vulnerability_in_gem_signature_verification.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability in gem signature verification
    *   **Description:** A flaw exists in the gem signature verification process within `rubygems/rubygems` that allows an attacker to bypass signature checks or forge valid signatures. This would enable the distribution and installation of malicious gems disguised as legitimate ones.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malicious gems without detection, leading to potential system compromise as described in the "Malicious Gem Upload" threat (though this threat focuses on a flaw in the verification *mechanism* within `rubygems/rubygems`).
    *   **Affected Component:** Gem signature verification logic within `rubygems/rubygems`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RubyGems updated to the latest version, as fixes for signature verification vulnerabilities would be included.
        *   Ensure that gem signing and verification are enabled and configured correctly in your environment.
        *   Monitor for any unexpected changes or issues with gem signature verification processes.

## Threat: [Insecure handling of gem metadata leading to command injection](./threats/insecure_handling_of_gem_metadata_leading_to_command_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure handling of gem metadata leading to command injection
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in how `rubygems/rubygems` processes gem metadata (e.g., in the `.gemspec` file) that allows an attacker to inject malicious commands. This could be triggered during gem installation or when querying gem information.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the server where the gem metadata is being processed.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gem metadata parsing and processing logic within `rubygems/rubygems`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RubyGems updated to the latest version, as input validation and sanitization improvements would address such vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid processing gem metadata from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through crafted gem files](./threats/denial_of_service_through_crafted_gem_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through crafted gem files
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious gem file that, when processed by `rubygems/rubygems` (e.g., during installation or inspection), causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to install or manage gems, potentially disrupting development or deployment processes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gem file parsing and processing logic within `rubygems/rubygems`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RubyGems updated to the latest version, as fixes for resource exhaustion vulnerabilities would be included.
        *   Implement timeouts and resource limits when processing gem files, if possible within your environment.
