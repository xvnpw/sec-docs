## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RubyGems [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rubygems__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities or malicious content within the RubyGems ecosystem. It serves as the root of all potential attacks leveraging RubyGems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Malicious Gem [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_gem__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker introduces malicious code into the application by exploiting the gem installation process. This is a high-risk path because it encompasses several relatively likely attack vectors with significant impact. The "Exploit Malicious Gem" node is critical as it is the primary mechanism for injecting malicious code via RubyGems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Upload of Malicious Gem](./attack_tree_paths/direct_upload_of_malicious_gem.md)

**Upload Gem with Backdoor/Exploit:** An attacker creates a gem containing malicious code (e.g., a backdoor for remote access, code to exfiltrate data) and uploads it to a public or private gem repository. The attacker hopes that a developer will mistakenly install this gem, either due to a naming error or lack of proper verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Typosquatting Attack](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__typosquatting_attack.md)

**Upload Gem with Similar Name & Malicious Code:**  Attackers leverage the possibility of typos during gem installation. They create a gem with a name very similar to a popular, legitimate gem. Developers who make a typo when installing a dependency might inadvertently install the attacker's malicious gem. This is a high-risk path due to the ease of execution and reliance on common user errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Maintainer Account [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_maintainer_account__critical_node_.md)

**Gain Access to Legitimate Gem Maintainer Account & Upload Malicious Version:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a legitimate gem maintainer on a platform like RubyGems.org. This could be achieved through phishing, password reuse, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the platform's security. Once in control, the attacker can upload a malicious version of the legitimate gem, which will then be trusted and installed by users who update their dependencies. This is a critical node because it leverages the trust associated with legitimate packages, leading to potentially widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RubyGems.org Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rubygems_org_infrastructure__critical_node_.md)

This represents attacks that target the core infrastructure of RubyGems.org itself. While generally lower in likelihood due to the security measures in place, the impact of a successful attack is extremely high, making it a critical node.

    *   This category encompasses several potential attack vectors (though not explicitly marked as high-risk paths in this filtered view due to lower likelihood):
        *   **Compromise RubyGems.org Servers:** Gaining unauthorized access to the servers hosting RubyGems.org would allow an attacker to manipulate gems, user accounts, and potentially inject malicious code into legitimate gems.
        *   **CDN Compromise:** If the Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by RubyGems.org is compromised, attackers could serve malicious versions of gems to users.
        *   **DNS Hijacking:** By hijacking the DNS records for RubyGems.org, an attacker could redirect requests to a malicious server hosting fake gems.
