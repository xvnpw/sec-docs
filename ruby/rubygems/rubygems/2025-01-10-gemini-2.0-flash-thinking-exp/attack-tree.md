# Attack Tree Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

Objective: Compromise application using RubyGems by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Attack: Compromise Application Using RubyGems
- AND: Introduce Malicious Code via Gem
  - OR: Install Malicious Gem Directly **HIGH RISK PATH**
    - Typosquatting: Register a gem with a name similar to a legitimate dependency. **CRITICAL NODE**
  - OR: Compromise an Existing Gem **HIGH RISK PATH**
    - Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency: Leverage a known vulnerability in a gem the application depends on. **CRITICAL NODE**
    - Malicious Updates: A legitimate gem owner pushes an update containing malicious code. **CRITICAL NODE**
- AND: Exploit Gem Installation Hooks **HIGH RISK PATH**
  - Malicious Post-Install Scripts: Include scripts in the gem that execute arbitrary code after the gem is installed. **CRITICAL NODE**
- AND: Exploit Vulnerabilities in the `gem` Command or RubyGems Infrastructure
  - Compromise Gem Server Infrastructure: Gain access to the RubyGems server infrastructure and inject malicious gems or alter existing ones. **CRITICAL NODE**
```

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Install Malicious Gem Directly - Typosquatting (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_via_gem_-_install_malicious_gem_directly_-_typosquatting__critical_node_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Install Malicious Gem Directly**

- **Typosquatting (Critical Node):**
    - Attack Vector: An attacker registers a gem on RubyGems.org with a name that is a common misspelling of a legitimate dependency used by the application.
    - How it Works: If the application's `Gemfile` has a typo, or if a developer manually installs a gem with a typo, the malicious gem might be installed instead of the intended one.
    - Potential Impact: Upon installation, the malicious gem can execute arbitrary code within the application's environment, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Compromise an Existing Gem - Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_via_gem_-_compromise_an_existing_gem_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_a_dependenc_417dd4e0.md)

**High-Risk Path: Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Compromise an Existing Gem**

- **Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency (Critical Node):**
    - Attack Vector: Attackers identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities in gems that the application depends on.
    - How it Works: Applications using outdated or unpatched versions of gems are susceptible to these exploits. Attackers can leverage publicly available information or develop their own exploits to target these vulnerabilities.
    - Potential Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application, access sensitive data, or disrupt its operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Compromise an Existing Gem - Malicious Updates (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_via_gem_-_compromise_an_existing_gem_-_malicious_updates__critical_node_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Introduce Malicious Code via Gem -> Compromise an Existing Gem**

- **Malicious Updates (Critical Node):**
    - Attack Vector: A legitimate owner of a widely used gem is either compromised, or a malicious insider pushes an update to the gem containing malicious code.
    - How it Works: Applications configured for automatic gem updates will unknowingly install the compromised version. Even with manual updates, developers might not thoroughly review the changes in every update.
    - Potential Impact: This can have a widespread and critical impact, as many applications relying on the compromised gem will be affected. The malicious code can execute within the context of each affected application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gem Installation Hooks - Malicious Post-Install Scripts (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gem_installation_hooks_-_malicious_post-install_scripts__critical_node_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Gem Installation Hooks**

- **Malicious Post-Install Scripts (Critical Node):**
    - Attack Vector: Attackers include malicious scripts within a gem that are designed to execute automatically after the gem is successfully installed.
    - How it Works: RubyGems allows gems to define post-install scripts that are executed by the `gem` command. Attackers can leverage this feature to run arbitrary code on the system where the gem is installed.
    - Potential Impact: These scripts can perform various malicious actions, such as creating backdoor accounts, installing malware, exfiltrating data, or modifying system configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the `gem` Command or RubyGems Infrastructure - Compromise Gem Server Infrastructure (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the__gem__command_or_rubygems_infrastructure_-_compromise_gem_server_infr_b6789ec5.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Gem Server Infrastructure**

- **Attack Vector:** Highly sophisticated attackers gain unauthorized access to the RubyGems.org server infrastructure.
- **How it Works:** This would involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the RubyGems.org servers, network, or associated systems.
- **Potential Impact:** This is a critical scenario with widespread and severe consequences. Attackers could inject malicious code into numerous gems, alter existing legitimate gems, or even disrupt the entire RubyGems ecosystem, affecting countless applications and developers.
