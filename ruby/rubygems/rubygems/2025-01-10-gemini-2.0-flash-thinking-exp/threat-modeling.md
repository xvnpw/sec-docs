# Threat Model Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Threat: [Malicious Gem Injection (Direct)](./threats/malicious_gem_injection__direct_.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious Gem Injection (Direct)
    - **Description:** An attacker publishes a new gem containing malicious code (e.g., backdoors, malware, data exfiltration tools) under a deceptive name or as an update to an abandoned but still used gem. Developers unknowingly include this malicious gem as a dependency in their application. This directly involves the publishing and distribution mechanisms of `rubygems/rubygems`.
    - **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application server, data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, potential supply chain attacks affecting downstream users of the application.
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Commands::PushCommand` (used for publishing gems), `Gem::Package` (the format of the gem file), `Gem::Installer` (used for installing gems).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Carefully vet gem dependencies and their maintainers. Check their history, reputation, and activity.
        - Utilize dependency scanning tools that check for known malicious packages or suspicious code patterns.
        - Implement a process for reviewing gem updates and changes before deploying them.
        - Consider using a private gem repository for internal dependencies to reduce reliance on the public RubyGems.org.
        - Employ strong authentication and authorization for publishing gems (if applicable).

## Threat: [Malicious Gem Injection (Typosquatting/Dependency Confusion)](./threats/malicious_gem_injection__typosquattingdependency_confusion_.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious Gem Injection (Typosquatting/Dependency Confusion)
    - **Description:** An attacker publishes a gem with a name very similar to a legitimate, popular gem (typosquatting) or with a name that might conflict with internal package names (dependency confusion). Developers accidentally include the malicious gem in their `Gemfile`. This exploits the naming and discovery features within `rubygems/rubygems`.
    - **Impact:**  Similar to direct malicious gem injection, leading to potential compromise of the application.
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Commands::PushCommand`, `Gem::Package`, `Gem::Resolver` (used for resolving dependencies), `Gem::Specification` (metadata about the gem).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Double-check gem names meticulously when adding dependencies to the `Gemfile`.
        - Utilize dependency locking mechanisms (like `Gemfile.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency resolution and prevent unexpected installations.
        - Monitor dependency updates and be wary of unexpected additions or changes.
        - Consider using a private gem repository with namespace management to prevent naming collisions with public gems.

## Threat: [Compromised Gem Maintainer Account](./threats/compromised_gem_maintainer_account.md)

- **Threat:** Compromised Gem Maintainer Account
    - **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a legitimate gem maintainer (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the maintainer's systems). They then push malicious updates to an otherwise trusted gem. This directly involves the account management and publishing features of `rubygems/rubygems`.
    - **Impact:**  Widespread impact on applications using the compromised gem, potentially affecting a large number of users who trust the legitimate source.
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Commands::PushCommand`, `Gem::Authentication` (how users are authenticated to push gems), `Gem::Server` (the infrastructure hosting the gems).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Encourage gem maintainers to use strong, multi-factor authentication on their RubyGems.org accounts.
        - Monitor gem updates from trusted sources for unexpected or suspicious changes.
        - Implement a rollback strategy in case a malicious update is detected and needs to be reverted.
        - Consider using gem signing and verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of gems.

## Threat: [Inclusion of Gems with Known Security Vulnerabilities](./threats/inclusion_of_gems_with_known_security_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Threat:** Inclusion of Gems with Known Security Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** Developers unknowingly include gems in their application that have publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. While the vulnerability exists within the gem's code, the discovery and management of these vulnerabilities are related to the metadata and information tracked by `rubygems/rubygems`.
    - **Impact:**  Exposure to various vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the gem (e.g., remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service).
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Resolver` (selects gem versions), `Gem::Specification` (contains version information, including potential vulnerability disclosures), potentially any module within the vulnerable gem itself.
    - **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools that often rely on data from `rubygems/rubygems` or related databases.
        - Keep gem dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        - Implement a process for promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        - Consider using tools that automatically update dependencies with security fixes (with careful review).

## Threat: [Compromise of RubyGems.org Infrastructure](./threats/compromise_of_rubygems_org_infrastructure.md)

- **Threat:** Compromise of RubyGems.org Infrastructure
    - **Description:** A successful attack on the RubyGems.org infrastructure could allow attackers to inject malicious code into legitimate gems, modify gem metadata, or distribute malware directly through the platform. This directly targets the core infrastructure of `rubygems/rubygems`.
    - **Impact:**  Wide-scale impact on the Ruby ecosystem, potentially compromising numerous applications relying on gems from the compromised infrastructure.
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Server` (the core infrastructure), `Gem::Database` (storage of gem data), `Gem::Security` (mechanisms for securing the platform).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:** (Primarily relies on the security of the RubyGems.org platform itself, but application developers can take precautions)
        - Verify the integrity of downloaded gems using checksums (though this relies on the integrity of the checksum source).
        - Consider using alternative gem sources or mirroring if concerned about the primary RubyGems.org.
        - Stay informed about the security posture and any reported incidents related to RubyGems.org.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Gem Credentials (API Keys)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_gem_credentials__api_keys_.md)

- **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Gem Credentials (API Keys)
    - **Description:** Developers or CI/CD systems store RubyGems API keys insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in code, stored in version control, or in easily accessible configuration files). Attackers who gain access to these keys can publish malicious gems or modify existing ones, directly interacting with `rubygems/rubygems`' publishing mechanisms.
    - **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification or deletion of gems, potential introduction of malicious code, disruption of development workflows.
    - **Affected Component:** `Gem::Credentials` (manages API keys), `Gem::Commands::PushCommand`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Store API keys securely using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        - Avoid hardcoding API keys in code or configuration files.
        - Use environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms to manage API keys.
        - Implement proper access control and auditing for gem publishing processes.
