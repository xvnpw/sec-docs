# Threat Model Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Threat: [Malicious Gem Injection](./threats/malicious_gem_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious gems to RubyGems.org or private gem repositories. Developers, using RubyGems to manage dependencies, unknowingly include these compromised gems in their applications via `Gemfile`. Upon `bundle install` or `gem install`, the malicious gem is downloaded and its code is executed within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, backdoors, or service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, critical data breach, unauthorized persistent access, severe reputational damage, significant service disruption.
*   **RubyGems Component Affected:** Gem installation process (`gem install`, `bundle install`), RubyGems repository interaction, dependency resolution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous gem dependency review processes.
    *   Mandatory use of dependency scanning tools like Bundler Audit, Gemnasium, or Dependabot in CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Strictly pin gem versions in `Gemfile.lock` to prevent unexpected malicious updates.
    *   Conduct source code audits of gems, especially for critical dependencies and new additions.
    *   Proactively monitor RubyGems security advisories and gem update notifications.
    *   For sensitive internal code, utilize private gem repositories with strict access controls.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Gem Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_gem_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** RubyGems manages application dependencies, and vulnerabilities are frequently discovered in gems. Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in gems that are dependencies of an application. If developers fail to update gems promptly using RubyGems' update mechanisms (`bundle update`), applications remain vulnerable to exploitation, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access to systems and data, potential for lateral movement within infrastructure.
*   **RubyGems Component Affected:** Gem dependency management, `bundle update` functionality, lack of proactive vulnerability scanning within RubyGems itself (relies on external tools).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity and exploitability of the gem vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a robust and frequent gem update schedule using `bundle update` and thorough testing.
    *   Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools (Bundler Audit, Gemnasium, Dependabot) into development workflows and CI/CD.
    *   Develop and enforce a rapid patch management process specifically for gem vulnerabilities identified by scanning tools or security advisories.
    *   Actively monitor security mailing lists and RubyGems vulnerability databases for timely awareness of new threats.

## Threat: [Typosquatting/Dependency Confusion leading to Malicious Gem Installation](./threats/typosquattingdependency_confusion_leading_to_malicious_gem_installation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage RubyGems' public nature to register gems with names that are very similar to popular, legitimate gems (typosquatting) or names that could be mistaken for internal or private gems (dependency confusion). Developers using RubyGems, through typos in `Gemfile` or misconfigured gem sources, might inadvertently install these malicious, similarly named gems. RubyGems, by default, might prioritize public repositories, increasing the risk of dependency confusion attacks if private repositories are not correctly configured.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malicious code through RubyGems, leading to application compromise, potential data breaches, and introduction of backdoors.
*   **RubyGems Component Affected:** Gem installation process (`gem install`, `bundle install`), RubyGems repository search and resolution, gem naming conventions within the RubyGems ecosystem.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mandatory double-checking and verification of gem names during dependency declaration in `Gemfile`.
    *   Promote the use of IDE autocomplete and code completion features to minimize typographical errors when specifying gem names.
    *   For applications using private gems, explicitly and correctly configure gem sources in `Gemfile` to prioritize private repositories and prevent dependency confusion with public gems on RubyGems.org.
    *   Educate development teams about the risks of typosquatting and dependency confusion within the RubyGems ecosystem.

## Threat: [Compromised Gem Maintainer Account leading to Malicious Gem Updates](./threats/compromised_gem_maintainer_account_leading_to_malicious_gem_updates.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise legitimate gem maintainer accounts on RubyGems.org through credential theft or social engineering. Using these compromised credentials, attackers can push malicious updates to existing, trusted gems. RubyGems' update mechanism will then distribute these malicious versions to users who update their dependencies, as the updates appear to originate from a trusted source.
*   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malicious code via RubyGems' update mechanism, potentially compromising a large number of applications relying on the affected gem. This can lead to significant supply chain attacks.
*   **RubyGems Component Affected:** Gem publishing process on RubyGems.org, RubyGems.org account management and authentication, gem update distribution mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (due to the potential for widespread and impactful supply chain attacks)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   If maintaining gems on RubyGems.org, enforce strong account security practices, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), for all maintainer accounts.
    *   Implement rigorous code review processes for all gem updates, even from trusted maintainers, especially for critical dependencies.
    *   Establish a community monitoring and incident response process to quickly identify and react to suspicious gem updates reported by the Ruby community.
    *   Consider implementing a delay between gem updates and automatic deployment to allow for community scrutiny and detection of potentially malicious updates before widespread adoption.

## Threat: [Usage of Outdated/Unmaintained Gems with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/usage_of_outdatedunmaintained_gems_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** RubyGems manages application dependencies, but developers might continue using gems that are no longer actively maintained by their original authors. These unmaintained gems often cease to receive security updates, even when new vulnerabilities are discovered. Applications relying on these outdated gems, managed by RubyGems, become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation as public knowledge of these vulnerabilities grows and exploits become available.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface due to known, unpatched vulnerabilities in outdated gems. Potential application compromise and data breaches through exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
*   **RubyGems Component Affected:** Gem dependency management, lack of built-in mechanism within RubyGems to flag or prevent the use of unmaintained gems, reliance on developers to actively manage and audit dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit gem dependencies to identify unmaintained gems. Utilize tools and scripts to assess gem activity and last update dates.
    *   Prioritize replacing unmaintained gems with actively maintained alternatives that provide similar functionality and security support.
    *   If replacing an unmaintained gem is not immediately feasible for critical functionality, consider forking the gem and taking responsibility for its maintenance, including applying necessary security patches.
    *   When selecting new gems, prioritize actively maintained projects with a history of security responsiveness and regular updates.
