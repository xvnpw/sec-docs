# BUSINESS POSTURE

The rubygems project aims to provide a reliable and secure package management system for the Ruby programming language. It facilitates the discovery, distribution, and installation of Ruby libraries and applications (gems).

- Business priorities:
  - Ensure the availability and stability of the gem ecosystem for Ruby developers.
  - Maintain the security and integrity of gems to protect users from malicious software.
  - Support the Ruby community by providing a robust and user-friendly package management tool.
  - Promote the adoption of Ruby by simplifying dependency management.

- Business goals:
  - Provide a command-line tool for gem management.
  - Offer a standard format for packaging Ruby libraries and applications.
  - Enable developers to easily publish and share their gems.
  - Allow users to securely install and manage gems and their dependencies.
  - Maintain compatibility with various Ruby versions and platforms.

- Business risks:
  - Supply chain attacks through compromised gems.
  - Availability issues impacting Ruby development workflows.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the rubygems tool itself.
  - Lack of trust in the gem ecosystem due to security incidents.
  - Compatibility problems hindering adoption and usability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Automated testing suite (present in GitHub repository, using tools like `rake test`).
  - security control: Gem signing and verification (partially implemented, allows gem authors to sign gems, and users to verify signatures).
  - security control: RubyGems.org (related service, not part of this repository directly, but crucial for the ecosystem) implements security measures like HTTPS, authentication for publishing, and malware scanning.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by rubygems.
  - accepted risk: Risk of compromised developer accounts on RubyGems.org (mitigated by RubyGems.org security measures, but still a residual risk).
  - accepted risk: Social engineering attacks targeting gem authors.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Enhance gem signature verification to be mandatory or more prominently enforced.
  - security control: Security audits of the rubygems codebase and processes.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and input validation on command-line interface to prevent abuse.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: For publishing gems to RubyGems.org, authors must authenticate with RubyGems.org (handled by RubyGems.org service, interaction from rubygems CLI).
    - Requirement: For accessing private gem repositories (if supported in future), authentication mechanisms should be in place.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Ensure that only authorized users (gem authors) can publish new gems or update existing ones on RubyGems.org.
    - Requirement: When accessing private gem repositories (if supported in future), authorization should control access based on user roles and permissions.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs to the rubygems command-line tool to prevent command injection and other input-based vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Validate gem specifications and metadata to prevent malicious or malformed gems from being processed.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptography for gem signing and verification processes.
    - Requirement: Ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) when interacting with RubyGems.org and other gem repositories.
    - Requirement: Securely store and handle any cryptographic keys used for gem signing or encryption.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for security vulnerability management in rubygems?
  - Are there any existing SAST or dependency scanning tools used in the build process?
  - What is the key management strategy for gem signing?
  - Are there any plans to enforce or promote gem signature verification more strongly?
  - What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach or vulnerability in rubygems?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: Assumed that the primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable package manager for the Ruby community.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Assumed that security is a high priority, but there are areas for improvement, particularly in automated security checks and stronger enforcement of gem signing.
  - DESIGN: Assumed that the rubygems repository primarily focuses on the CLI tool and core library, and that RubyGems.org is a separate but tightly related service. Assumed a standard local machine deployment model for the CLI tool and a typical CI/CD pipeline for building and releasing rubygems.
