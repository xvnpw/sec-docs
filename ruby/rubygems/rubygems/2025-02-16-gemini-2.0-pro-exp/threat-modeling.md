# Threat Model Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Threat: [Gem Hijacking (RubyGems.org Account Compromise)](./threats/gem_hijacking__rubygems_org_account_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a gem maintainer's RubyGems.org account (e.g., through phishing, password reuse, or session hijacking). The attacker then publishes a new, malicious version of a legitimate gem.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications that depend on the hijacked gem.  Leads to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, etc.
    *   **Affected Component:** Affects the RubyGems.org API and the `gem push` command used to publish gems. The entire gem publishing infrastructure is at risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **RubyGems.org Security:** Relies heavily on RubyGems.org's security practices (2FA enforcement, account monitoring). This is largely outside the direct control of individual developers.
        *   **Gemfile.lock Pinning:** As always, `Gemfile.lock` provides a checksum-based defense *after* a malicious version is detected and yanked.
        *   **Monitor RubyGems.org Announcements:** Stay informed about security incidents reported by RubyGems.org.
        *   **Prompt Updates:** After a compromised gem is identified and a fixed version is released, update your application's dependencies *immediately*.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Gem Installation](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_gem_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network communication between the developer's machine (or CI/CD server) and RubyGems.org. The attacker can then inject a malicious gem or modify a legitimate gem during the download process.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of a compromised gem, leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Affects the `gem install` and `bundle install` commands, specifically the network communication layer used to download gems.  The `Net::HTTP` library (or similar) used by RubyGems is the target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure that all gem sources in the `Gemfile` use HTTPS (`https://rubygems.org`). RubyGems.org enforces HTTPS, but verify this.
        *   **Network Security:** Use a secure network connection (e.g., VPN) when installing gems, especially in CI/CD environments.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** Consider certificate pinning for RubyGems.org, but be aware of the operational complexities.

## Threat: [Malicious `post_install` or `pre_install` hooks](./threats/malicious__post_install__or__pre_install__hooks.md)

*   **Description:** RubyGems allows gems to define `post_install` and `pre_install` hooks in their extensions. These hooks are Ruby scripts that are executed automatically after or before the gem is installed. A malicious gem could use these hooks to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user installing the gem, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `Gem::Installer` class and its methods related to handling extensions and running pre/post install hooks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the source code of gems, paying close attention to any `extconf.rb` files or other files that might define installation hooks.
        *   **Limited Privileges:** Install gems with the least privileges necessary. Avoid installing gems as root or administrator.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate the gem installation process.
        *   **Disable Extensions:** If a gem doesn't require native extensions, you can try installing it with the `--ignore-dependencies` flag and manually installing any required dependencies that *do* have extensions, after reviewing them. This is a workaround, not a perfect solution.

## Threat: [Unsafe YAML Deserialization in Gemspec](./threats/unsafe_yaml_deserialization_in_gemspec.md)

*   **Description:** The `gemspec` file, which contains metadata about a gem, is often parsed using YAML. If the YAML parser is configured insecurely, it could be vulnerable to object injection attacks, where an attacker crafts a malicious `gemspec` that, when parsed, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code during gem installation or when the `gemspec` is loaded, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `Gem::Specification` class and its methods for loading and parsing `gemspec` files, specifically the YAML parsing component (typically `Psych`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Safe YAML Loading:** Ensure that RubyGems and Bundler are using a secure YAML parser configuration (e.g., `Psych.safe_load` in newer versions of Psych). Keep Ruby and RubyGems updated.
        *   **Gemspec Validation:** Implement additional validation of `gemspec` files before parsing them, checking for suspicious patterns or unexpected data. This is more of a mitigation for gem authors.
