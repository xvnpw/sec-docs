## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__attacker's_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_.md)

Description: This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. All attack paths aim to achieve this. Successful execution of arbitrary code grants the attacker significant control over the application server or developer's machine.
Impact: Very High. Complete system compromise, data breaches, potential for lateral movement within the network.
Mitigation: All security measures ultimately aim to prevent this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [1. Compromise a Legitimate Gem]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__1__compromise_a_legitimate_gem_.md)

Description: Gaining control over a legitimate, widely-used gem allows the attacker to distribute malicious code to all applications that depend on that gem. This is a supply chain attack.
Impact: Very High. Widespread impact, potentially affecting many applications and users.
Mitigation:
Strong authentication and authorization for gem maintainers (MFA).
Code review processes for gem updates.
Security scanning of gem code.
Vulnerability disclosure program for RubyGems.org.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.1. Gain Access to Gem Maintainer's Credentials] [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_1__gain_access_to_gem_maintainer's_credentials___hr___cn_.md)

Description: This is the most direct route to compromising a legitimate gem. The attacker obtains the credentials needed to publish updates to the gem.
Impact: Very High. Allows the attacker to directly inject malicious code into a legitimate gem.
Mitigation:
Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for gem maintainers.
Strong password policies.
Phishing awareness training.
Monitoring for suspicious login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.1.1. Phishing] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_1_1__phishing___hr_.md)

Description: Tricking the gem maintainer into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails, websites, or other communication methods.
Impact: Very High. Leads to credential compromise and subsequent gem compromise.
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard.
Mitigation:
Phishing awareness training for gem maintainers.
Email security gateways to filter phishing attempts.
Use of security keys (e.g., FIDO2) for authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.1.1.1. Targeted Email] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_1_1_1__targeted_email___hr_.md)

Description: A more sophisticated phishing attack specifically tailored to the gem maintainer, increasing the likelihood of success.
Impact: Very High.
Effort: Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Hard.
Mitigation: Same as 1.1.1, with an emphasis on training to recognize targeted attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.2. Typosquatting (Similar Name)] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_2__typosquatting__similar_name____hr_.md)

Description: Publishing a malicious gem with a name very similar to a popular gem, hoping developers will accidentally install the malicious version due to a typo.
Impact: High. Can affect many applications if a popular gem is targeted.
Effort: Low.
Skill Level: Novice.
Detection Difficulty: Medium.
Mitigation:
Name similarity checks during gem publishing.
Developer education on careful gem name verification.
Use of `Gemfile.lock` to pin exact gem versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [2. Supply Chain Attack via Dependency Confusion] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__2__supply_chain_attack_via_dependency_confusion___hr_.md)

Description: Exploiting how RubyGems resolves dependencies when both internal (private) and public repositories are used. The attacker publishes a malicious gem to the public repository with the same name as an internal gem.
Impact: High. Can lead to the execution of malicious code from the public repository instead of the intended internal gem.
Mitigation:
Explicit source configuration in the Gemfile (e.g., `source "https://my-internal-gem-server.com"`).
Never use the same name for internal and public gems.
Use scoped packages (e.g., `@my-company/my-gem`).
Regularly audit Gemfile configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [2.1. Publish Malicious Package to Public Repository] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__2_1__publish_malicious_package_to_public_repository___hr_.md)

Description: The attacker creates and publishes a gem with the same name as an internal gem used by the target organization.
Impact: High. Sets the stage for the dependency confusion attack.
Effort: Low.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Medium.
Mitigation: Same as 2.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [2.1.1. Social Engineering/Deception] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__2_1_1__social_engineeringdeception___hr_.md)

Description: The attacker may use social engineering to gather information about the target's internal gem names.
Impact: High (indirectly, by enabling 2.1).
Effort: Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Hard.
Mitigation:
Security awareness training for employees to recognize and report social engineering attempts.
Limit the public disclosure of internal infrastructure details.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [2.2. Leverage Internal Repository Naming Conflicts] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__2_2__leverage_internal_repository_naming_conflicts___hr_.md)

Description: This is the exploitation step where RubyGems, due to misconfiguration or default behavior, prioritizes the malicious public gem over the intended internal gem.
Impact: High. Results in the execution of the attacker's code.
Effort: Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Medium.
Mitigation: Same as 2.
