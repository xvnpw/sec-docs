# Attack Surface Analysis for rubygems/rubygems

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Gem Installation (Typosquatting/Brandjacking/Dependency Confusion)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_gem_installation__typosquattingbrandjackingdependency_confusion_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish malicious gems to public or private repositories, tricking developers into installing them via RubyGems' mechanisms.
    *   **How RubyGems Contributes:** RubyGems' reliance on a centralized repository (rubygems.org), its package management system (Bundler, `gem install`), and the ease of publishing gems are the *direct* contributing factors. The lack of mandatory, comprehensive code review within the RubyGems publishing process is a key weakness.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Typosquatting:** A developer intends to install `nokogiri` but accidentally types `nokogirl` and installs a malicious gem via `gem install` or Bundler.
        *   **Brandjacking:** An attacker publishes a gem named `rails-security-utils` that mimics legitimate Rails security tools but contains malicious code, installed through standard RubyGems commands.
        *   **Dependency Confusion:** An attacker publishes a malicious gem with the same name as an internal gem, but a higher version, to rubygems.org. A misconfigured `Gemfile` (using RubyGems' source directives) prioritizes the malicious gem.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise, application takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict `Gemfile.lock` Usage:** Always commit and use `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent builds, preventing unexpected gem upgrades via Bundler.
        *   **Explicit Gem Sources:** Specify trusted gem sources in the `Gemfile` (e.g., `source 'https://rubygems.org'`). This uses RubyGems' own source configuration.
        *   **Precise Version Constraints:** Use specific version constraints in the `Gemfile` (e.g., `= 1.2.3` or `~> 1.2.3`). Avoid broad constraints that could lead to unintended gem selections by Bundler.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ tools like Bundler-audit (which directly interacts with RubyGems data) to scan for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Private Gem Server Security:** If using private gem servers *integrated with RubyGems*, implement robust security.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enforce 2FA for accounts with publishing rights to rubygems.org. This directly mitigates compromised publisher accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Gem Repository (rubygems.org)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_gem_repository__rubygems_org_.md)

*   **Description:** A direct compromise of the rubygems.org infrastructure, allowing attackers to modify existing gems or inject malicious ones *at the source*.
    *   **How RubyGems Contributes:** The centralized nature of rubygems.org, *as the primary gem repository for RubyGems*, is the direct vulnerability. This is a core component of the RubyGems ecosystem.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains administrative access to rubygems.org and replaces the `rails` gem with a backdoored version. All subsequent installations via RubyGems would be compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications, massive data breaches, system takeovers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Monitor RubyGems Status:** Stay informed about security incidents related to rubygems.org. This is direct monitoring of the core RubyGems service.
        *   **Gem Signing (Limited):** While not a complete solution, gem signing (using RubyGems' built-in signing features) can *help* detect unauthorized modifications *if* signing keys are not compromised.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RubyGems Client (Bundler/`gem` command)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rubygems_client__bundler_gem__command_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities within the RubyGems client software itself (Bundler or the `gem` command). These are vulnerabilities *within* the tools provided by the RubyGems project.
    *   **How RubyGems Contributes:** The client software (`gem` and Bundler, which is itself a gem) is *part of* the RubyGems project and is the direct interface for users. Vulnerabilities here are directly attributable to RubyGems.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted gem file exploits a parsing vulnerability in Bundler, leading to arbitrary code execution when `bundle install` is run. This is a direct attack on the RubyGems-provided tool.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the `gem` command or Bundler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep RubyGems and Bundler Updated:** Regularly update to the latest versions to patch vulnerabilities. This is the *most critical* mitigation for this specific attack surface.
        *   **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all gem sources in the `Gemfile` use HTTPS (which is handled by the RubyGems client).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run gem installation commands with the least necessary privileges.
