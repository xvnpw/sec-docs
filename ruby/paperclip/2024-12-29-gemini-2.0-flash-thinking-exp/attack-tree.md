                *   Null Byte Injection in Filename
                *   Double Extension Trick (.jpg.php)
            *   Exploit Server Configuration **
                *   Misconfigured Web Server to Execute Uploaded Files
        *   Exploit Vulnerability in Image Processing Library (e.g., ImageMagick) **
            *   Remote Code Execution via Image Processing
    *   Unauthorized Access to Uploaded Files **

            *   Default Storage Location and Naming Scheme

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Upload Malicious File:**
    *   This represents the broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to upload a file with malicious intent. This is a critical node because successful malicious file upload can lead to severe consequences.

*   **Upload Executable File:**
    *   This is a high-risk path where the attacker specifically tries to upload a file that can be executed by the server. Success here often leads to remote code execution.

*   **Bypass File Extension Whitelist:**
    *   This is a critical node within the "Upload Executable File" path. Attackers attempt to circumvent the application's security measures that restrict allowed file extensions.
        *   **Null Byte Injection in Filename:** Attackers insert a null byte character (`%00`) into the filename. This can trick the server into truncating the filename before the disallowed extension is checked, allowing the upload of a malicious file with a disguised extension (e.g., `malicious.php%00.jpg`).
        *   **Double Extension Trick (.jpg.php):** Attackers use multiple file extensions. The web server might be configured to prioritize the last extension, leading to the execution of a file with a seemingly safe primary extension (e.g., `malicious.jpg.php` being interpreted as a PHP file).

*   **Exploit Server Configuration:**
    *   This is a critical node where the attacker leverages existing misconfigurations on the web server to execute uploaded files.
        *   **Misconfigured Web Server to Execute Uploaded Files:**  The web server might be configured to execute files in the upload directory, regardless of their extension. This could be due to incorrect settings in the server's configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess` in Apache) or the lack of proper restrictions.

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Image Processing Library (e.g., ImageMagick):**
    *   This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Paperclip often uses external libraries like ImageMagick for image processing. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by uploading specially crafted image files.
        *   **Remote Code Execution via Image Processing:**  Certain vulnerabilities in image processing libraries allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious image. The library, when processing the image, triggers the vulnerability, leading to code execution.

*   **Unauthorized Access to Uploaded Files:**
    *   This represents a high-risk path where attackers gain access to files they are not authorized to view or download. This can lead to data breaches and information disclosure.

*   **Predictable File Paths:**
    *   This is a critical node within the "Unauthorized Access to Uploaded Files" path. If the application uses predictable naming conventions or stores files in easily guessable locations, attackers can directly access them.
        *   **Default Storage Location and Naming Scheme:**  Using default configurations for file storage locations and naming schemes (e.g., sequential IDs, original filenames) makes it easier for attackers to guess the URLs of uploaded files and access them without proper authentication or authorization.
