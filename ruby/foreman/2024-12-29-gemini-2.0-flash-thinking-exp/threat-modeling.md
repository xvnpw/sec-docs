### High and Critical Foreman Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Foreman component:

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via `Procfile`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain write access to the `Procfile` and inject malicious commands within the process definitions. When Foreman starts or restarts the application, these injected commands will be executed on the server with the privileges of the user running Foreman. This could involve executing arbitrary system commands, installing malware, or creating backdoors.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Affected Foreman Component:** `Procfile` parsing and process execution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the `Procfile` to authorized users and processes only.
        *   Implement code reviews for any changes to the `Procfile`.
        *   Consider using a configuration management system to manage and deploy the `Procfile` securely.
        *   Run Foreman processes with the least privilege necessary.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** If environment variables used in the `Procfile` commands are sourced from untrusted input or can be manipulated by an attacker, they could inject malicious commands. When Foreman starts the processes, these manipulated environment variables will cause the execution of unintended commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Foreman Component:** Environment variable handling and process execution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid sourcing environment variables from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs without proper validation).
        *   Sanitize and validate any external input used to set environment variables.
        *   Store sensitive information securely using dedicated secret management solutions instead of environment variables.
        *   Restrict access to the system where environment variables are defined.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** Attackers who gain unauthorized access to the system or Foreman's configuration could read environment variables containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets. This could be achieved through file system access, memory dumps, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches, and compromise of external services.
    *   **Affected Foreman Component:** Environment variable handling and storage (system environment or `.env` files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in environment variables.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and inject secrets at runtime.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions on any files containing environment variable definitions (e.g., `.env` files).
        *   Encrypt sensitive environment variables if they must be stored directly.

*   **Threat:** Signal Injection and Process Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Foreman process or its control mechanisms could send signals (e.g., `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`) to the managed application processes. This could be done through system calls or by exploiting vulnerabilities in Foreman's signal handling.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service by terminating critical processes, application instability, potential data corruption if processes are terminated unexpectedly without proper cleanup.
    *   **Affected Foreman Component:** Process management and signal handling logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the Foreman process and the system it runs on.
        *   Implement proper process monitoring and alerting to detect unexpected process terminations.
        *   Ensure the application handles signals gracefully to prevent data corruption.
        *   Limit the ability to send signals to Foreman-managed processes to authorized users and processes.
