* **Command Injection via Procfile:**
    * **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `Procfile` that Foreman will execute.
    * **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman directly parses and executes the commands specified in the `Procfile`. If the `Procfile` content is dynamically generated or influenced by external factors without proper sanitization, it becomes a vector for command injection.
    * **Example:** An application reads a configuration file where a user can specify a custom command prefix. If this prefix is not sanitized and included in the `Procfile`, an attacker could set the prefix to `"; malicious_command; "` leading to arbitrary command execution.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Static Procfile Content:**  Avoid dynamically generating the `Procfile` content based on user input or external data.
        * **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic generation is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any external input used to construct `Procfile` commands.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Foreman and the managed processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Code Reviews:** Regularly review the code responsible for generating or handling the `Procfile`.

* **Path Traversal in Procfile:**
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths within the `Procfile` to point to unintended or malicious files.
    * **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman uses the paths specified in the `Procfile` to execute scripts or binaries. If these paths are not carefully controlled, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary files.
    * **Example:** A `Procfile` entry might look like `web: ./scripts/start_web.sh`. If an attacker can influence the path, they could change it to `web: ../../../malicious_script.sh` to execute a script outside the intended directory.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, access to sensitive files, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Absolute Paths:** Use absolute paths for all executables and scripts referenced in the `Procfile`.
        * **Restricted File System Access:** Limit the file system access of the user running Foreman and the managed processes.
        * **Input Validation:** If paths are derived from external sources, strictly validate and sanitize them to prevent traversal.

* **Exposure of Secrets in Procfile:**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys or database credentials might be directly embedded within the `Procfile` commands.
    * **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman reads the `Procfile` in plain text, making any embedded secrets easily accessible if the `Procfile` is compromised or inadvertently exposed (e.g., through version control).
    * **Example:** A `Procfile` entry might contain `db: ./manage.py migrate --settings=config.settings DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword`.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, compromise of external services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information as environment variables and access them within the application. Foreman facilitates setting environment variables for managed processes.
        * **Secret Management Tools:** Utilize dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve secrets.
        * **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode sensitive information directly in the `Procfile` or application code.
