# Attack Surface Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Imported Data](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_imported_data.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious data embedded within imported financial data files (e.g., CSV, bank statements) is processed by the application.
*   **How Maybe Contributes:** `maybe`'s parsing and processing logic for imported financial data might not adequately sanitize or validate the input. If `maybe` directly processes the raw data without sufficient checks, it can become a vector for injecting malicious commands or data that could be misinterpreted by the application or underlying systems.
*   **Example:** A malicious CSV file containing formulas that could trigger remote code execution if `maybe` uses a vulnerable library for CSV parsing or if the application interprets the data unsafely after `maybe` processes it.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the server, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data before it's processed by `maybe`. Use secure parsing libraries and avoid interpreting data as code. Apply the principle of least privilege to the user account running the application.

## Attack Surface: [Precision and Overflow Issues in Financial Calculations](./attack_surfaces/precision_and_overflow_issues_in_financial_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to numerical precision, integer overflows, or underflows in financial calculations.
*   **How Maybe Contributes:** As a library designed for financial calculations, `maybe`'s internal algorithms and data types for handling monetary values are critical. If `maybe` doesn't handle edge cases or large numbers correctly, attackers can craft scenarios leading to incorrect calculations, potentially manipulating financial forecasts or balances.
*   **Example:**  Inputting extremely large transaction amounts or manipulating exchange rates in a way that causes an integer overflow, leading to a significantly incorrect balance calculation reported by `maybe`.
*   **Impact:** Financial discrepancies, incorrect reporting, manipulation of financial forecasts, potential for financial loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly test `maybe`'s handling of extreme values and edge cases. Use appropriate data types for financial calculations (e.g., decimal types with sufficient precision). Implement checks for potential overflows and underflows. Regularly update `maybe` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `maybe`'s Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__maybe_'s_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and packages that `maybe` depends on.
*   **How Maybe Contributes:** `maybe`, like most software, relies on external libraries. If these dependencies have security vulnerabilities, they can be indirectly exploited through `maybe`. The application becomes vulnerable because it includes and uses the vulnerable code from `maybe`'s dependencies.
*   **Example:** A dependency used by `maybe` for date/time manipulation has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through interactions with `maybe` that utilize the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Regularly audit `maybe`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency checkers (e.g., `npm audit`, `pip check`). Keep `maybe` and its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
