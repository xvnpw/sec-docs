# Threat Model Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of API Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_api_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of API Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the API keys and secrets required by the `maybe` library to connect to financial institutions. This could happen if the `maybe` library itself stores credentials insecurely (though this is less likely and more of an application integration issue, it's still a potential risk if the library offers insecure storage options or defaults). The attacker could then use these credentials to access the victim's financial accounts through the financial institution's API.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to financial data, potential for fraudulent transactions, account manipulation, and exposure of sensitive personal and financial information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially the `maybe` library's internal credential handling if it doesn't enforce secure practices or offers insecure storage options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `maybe` library does not offer or default to insecure credential storage mechanisms.
        *   If the `maybe` library provides credential management features, ensure they align with security best practices.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on API Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_api_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on API Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application using `maybe` and the financial institution's API. This could be due to vulnerabilities in how the `maybe` library establishes or maintains secure connections. The attacker could then steal API keys, session tokens, or sensitive financial data being transmitted. They might also be able to modify requests or responses.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of API credentials, unauthorized access to financial data, manipulation of financial transactions, and potential data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** The API request function within the `maybe` library responsible for communicating with external APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `maybe` library enforces HTTPS for all API communication.
        *   Investigate if the `maybe` library supports and utilizes certificate pinning.
        *   Regularly update the `maybe` library to benefit from the latest security patches in its networking components.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs
    *   **Description:** The `maybe` library logs sensitive financial data or API responses without proper sanitization. An attacker gaining access to these logs could then retrieve this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of financial data, API keys, transaction details, and potentially personally identifiable information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Logging mechanisms within the `maybe` library itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review the `maybe` library's logging configuration and ensure sensitive data is not logged or is properly sanitized.
        *   If possible, configure the `maybe` library to avoid logging sensitive information.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The `maybe` library relies on other third-party libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities within the `maybe` library's context to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The dependency management system and the specific vulnerable dependencies of the `maybe` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `maybe` library to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the `maybe` library and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated or Vulnerable `maybe` Library Version](./threats/use_of_outdated_or_vulnerable__maybe__library_version.md)

*   **Threat:** Use of Outdated or Vulnerable `maybe` Library Version
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the `maybe` library that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers could directly exploit these vulnerabilities within the `maybe` library's code.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `maybe` library itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `maybe` library to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to the `maybe` library.
        *   Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.
