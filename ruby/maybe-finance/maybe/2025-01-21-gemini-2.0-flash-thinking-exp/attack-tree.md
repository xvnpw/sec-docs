## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Data Injection during Account Sync](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_data_injection_during_account_sync.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploiting Maybe's data ingestion and parsing logic when synchronizing with external financial institutions.
*   Description: An attacker, having compromised a user's financial account credentials, manipulates the data stream from the financial institution. This involves crafting malicious transaction data, account names, or balances that, when processed by Maybe, exploit vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or logic flaws.
*   Critical Node: Inject malicious data designed to exploit parsing or processing logic in Maybe. This is the point where the malicious payload is delivered, potentially leading to code execution, data corruption, or manipulation of application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Deserialization (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Leveraging insecure deserialization of data handled by Maybe to achieve remote code execution.
*   Description: If Maybe deserializes data from untrusted sources (e.g., during data import or caching) without proper safeguards, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When Maybe deserializes this object, it executes arbitrary code on the application server.
*   Critical Node: Exploiting Insecure Deserialization (if applicable). The presence of insecure deserialization is the fundamental vulnerability.
*   Critical Node: Craft a malicious serialized object containing code to be executed. This is the specific action required to prepare the exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Maybe](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_maybe.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploiting known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Maybe depends on.
*   Description: Maybe, like most software, relies on external libraries. If these libraries have publicly known vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This often involves using existing exploit code or crafting specific requests to trigger the vulnerability.
*   Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Maybe. The existence of these vulnerabilities creates the attack surface.
*   Critical Node: Check for known vulnerabilities in these libraries using vulnerability databases. This is the attacker's reconnaissance step to identify exploitable weaknesses.
*   Critical Node: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities based on vulnerability details. This is the action of leveraging the identified vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
