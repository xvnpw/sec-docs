### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving maybe-finance/maybe

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `maybe-finance/maybe` library:

* **Threat:** Exposure of Credentials in Transit
    * **Description:** An attacker could intercept the credentials being transmitted between the application and the `maybe-finance/maybe` library or between the library and the financial institution's API. This could occur through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if HTTPS is not enforced or if TLS configurations are weak *within the library's communication handling or the application's interaction with it*.
    * **Impact:**  Compromised credentials could allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access their financial data or perform unauthorized actions.
    * **Affected Component:** The communication channels between the application and `maybe-finance/maybe`, and the internal communication within `maybe-finance/maybe` when interacting with financial institution APIs.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure `maybe-finance/maybe` enforces HTTPS for all communication with financial institution APIs.
        * Verify the application's configuration when interacting with `maybe-finance/maybe` ensures secure communication.
        * Implement certificate pinning where appropriate within the application's interaction with the library or if the library provides such options.

* **Threat:** API Key or Secret Exposure
    * **Description:**  If the application passes API keys or secrets to `maybe-finance/maybe` for accessing financial institutions, vulnerabilities in how the library handles or transmits these secrets could lead to their exposure. This could include insecure storage within the library's temporary files or memory, or insecure transmission if the library doesn't enforce HTTPS internally.
    * **Impact:**  Exposed API keys or secrets could allow attackers to access financial institution APIs on behalf of the application, potentially exceeding intended usage limits, accessing data they shouldn't, or performing actions that could harm the application or its users.
    * **Affected Component:** The parts of `maybe-finance/maybe` that handle API key authentication and storage (even temporary).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure `maybe-finance/maybe` does not store API keys or secrets insecurely.
        * Verify that the library uses secure methods for transmitting API keys when interacting with financial institution APIs.
        * If the library offers options for custom API key handling, ensure those are implemented securely.

* **Threat:** Data Injection Vulnerabilities in API Calls
    * **Description:** If `maybe-finance/maybe` doesn't properly sanitize or escape data provided by the application before constructing API calls to financial institutions, attackers could inject malicious code or parameters. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other unintended actions on the financial institution's side.
    * **Impact:**  Attackers could potentially access or manipulate financial data beyond their authorized scope, potentially leading to financial loss or data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** The parts of `maybe-finance/maybe` responsible for constructing and sending API requests.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure `maybe-finance/maybe` performs proper input sanitization and validation before making API calls.
        * If the library provides options for customizing API request construction, ensure those are used securely.
        * Avoid passing unsanitized user input directly to `maybe-finance/maybe` for API call construction.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `maybe-finance/maybe` Dependencies
    * **Description:** The `maybe-finance/maybe` library relies on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through the application *via the vulnerable dependency within `maybe-finance/maybe`*.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution within the context of the application.
    * **Affected Component:** The dependencies of the `maybe-finance/maybe` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `maybe-finance/maybe` library to the latest version, which should include updated dependencies.
        * Monitor the `maybe-finance/maybe` project for security advisories related to its dependencies.

* **Threat:** Bugs or Vulnerabilities within `maybe-finance/maybe`
    * **Description:** The `maybe-finance/maybe` library itself might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the context of the application.
    * **Affected Component:** Any part of the `maybe-finance/maybe` library's codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with the latest versions of `maybe-finance/maybe`.
        * Monitor the library's issue tracker and security advisories.
        * Consider contributing to the library's security by reporting any discovered vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Transit from Financial Institutions
    * **Description:** Although `maybe-finance/maybe` likely uses HTTPS, if there are misconfigurations or vulnerabilities *within the library's handling of the secure connection* or if the financial institution's API has issues, sensitive financial data being transmitted back to the application could be intercepted.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of users' financial data, potentially leading to identity theft or financial fraud.
    * **Affected Component:** The communication channel between `maybe-finance/maybe` and the financial institution APIs, specifically the TLS implementation within the library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the application uses a version of `maybe-finance/maybe` that utilizes secure and up-to-date TLS libraries.
        * Monitor the `maybe-finance/maybe` project for any reported issues related to secure communication.
        * While less direct, consider implementing end-to-end encryption at the application level if extremely sensitive data is being handled.
