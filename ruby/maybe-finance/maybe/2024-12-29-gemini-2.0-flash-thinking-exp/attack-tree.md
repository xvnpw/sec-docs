## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Maybe Finance - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive financial data managed by Maybe, manipulate financial data, or disrupt the application's financial features.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using Maybe Finance (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Exploit Maybe's Data Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **SQL Injection via Maybe's Data Access Layer (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Data Leakage through Maybe's Logging or Error Handling (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * **Exploit Maybe's External Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Vulnerable Dependencies Used by Maybe (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * **Exploit Maybe's Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Insecure Default Configuration of Maybe (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Misconfiguration of Maybe by the Application Developer (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Exposure of Maybe's Configuration Files (HIGH RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using Maybe Finance (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at any of the child nodes can lead to achieving this goal.

* **Exploit Maybe's Data Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This category encompasses vulnerabilities in how Maybe processes and stores financial data. Exploiting these flaws can directly lead to data breaches or manipulation.
    * **SQL Injection via Maybe's Data Access Layer (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Inject malicious SQL queries to access or modify financial data. If Maybe directly interacts with a database and constructs SQL queries dynamically without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code through user-supplied input or manipulated data. This could allow them to read, modify, or delete sensitive financial data.
    * **Data Leakage through Maybe's Logging or Error Handling (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Extract sensitive financial information from logs or error messages. If Maybe logs sensitive financial data or includes it in error messages, an attacker with access to these logs could extract this information.

* **Exploit Maybe's External Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This category focuses on vulnerabilities introduced through third-party libraries used by Maybe.
    * **Vulnerable Dependencies Used by Maybe (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Maybe. Maybe likely relies on third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise Maybe and, consequently, the application.

* **Exploit Maybe's Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This category highlights risks arising from insecure or incorrect configuration of the Maybe library.
    * **Insecure Default Configuration of Maybe (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Leverage default settings that are insecure or expose sensitive information. If Maybe has insecure default settings (e.g., default credentials, overly permissive access controls), an attacker could exploit these settings if the application developer doesn't change them.
    * **Misconfiguration of Maybe by the Application Developer (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Exploit incorrect configuration settings that introduce vulnerabilities. Incorrect configuration of Maybe by the application developer (e.g., exposing sensitive configuration files, using weak credentials) can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Exposure of Maybe's Configuration Files (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * Gain access to configuration files containing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials. If Maybe's configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys, etc.) are exposed (e.g., through misconfigured web servers or insecure storage), an attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
