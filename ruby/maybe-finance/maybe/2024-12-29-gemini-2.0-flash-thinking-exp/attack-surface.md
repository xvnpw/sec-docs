Here are the high and critical risk attack surfaces that directly involve the `maybe-finance/maybe` application:

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Storage of Third-Party API Credentials
    *   **Description:**  Sensitive credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) required to connect to external financial institutions are stored insecurely.
    *   **How Maybe Contributes:** `Maybe` needs to store these credentials to automate data retrieval from user-linked accounts. If the storage mechanism is weak, it directly introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** Storing API keys in plain text in configuration files, using weak encryption, or storing them in easily accessible databases without proper access controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers gaining access to these credentials can impersonate users and access their financial accounts, potentially leading to financial loss, unauthorized transactions, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Utilize secure credential management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), employ strong encryption at rest for sensitive data, leverage environment variables for configuration, and avoid hardcoding credentials in the codebase.
        *   **Users:**  While users have limited control over this, they should be aware of the risks and choose applications with a strong security reputation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insufficient Validation of Data from Third-Party APIs
    *   **Description:** The application doesn't adequately validate data received from external financial institution APIs.
    *   **How Maybe Contributes:** `Maybe` relies on external APIs for financial data. If it blindly trusts the data received, malicious or compromised APIs could inject false information.
    *   **Example:** A compromised bank API injecting fraudulent transactions into a user's account within `maybe`, leading to incorrect balances or misleading financial insights.
    *   **Impact:**  Incorrect financial information displayed to the user, potential for manipulation of application logic based on false data, and in extreme cases, triggering unintended actions within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation on all data received from external APIs, verify data types and ranges, and implement checksums or signatures where possible to ensure data integrity.
        *   **Users:**  Regularly cross-reference information within `maybe` with their actual bank statements to identify discrepancies.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Communication with Mobile Application (if applicable)
    *   **Description:** If `maybe` has a mobile application, the communication between the mobile app and the backend server is not properly secured.
    *   **How Maybe Contributes:**  A mobile app component introduces a new communication channel that needs to be secured. Weaknesses here are specific to the application's architecture.
    *   **Example:** Lack of HTTPS enforcement or certificate pinning allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and intercept or modify sensitive financial data transmitted between the mobile app and the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive financial data, potential for unauthorized access to user accounts, and manipulation of data in transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication, implement certificate pinning in the mobile app, and use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Users:** Ensure they are using the official app from trusted sources and avoid using the app on untrusted networks.
