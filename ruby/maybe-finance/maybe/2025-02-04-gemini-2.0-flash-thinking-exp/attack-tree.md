## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Data Storage Vulnerabilities in maybe-finance/maybe](./attack_tree_paths/1___high-risk_path__exploit_data_storage_vulnerabilities_in_maybe-financemaybe.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target weaknesses in how financial data is stored by maybe-finance, focusing on local storage if it's a local-first application.

    *   **1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Insecure Local Data Storage**

        *   **Description:** If maybe-finance stores data locally without proper security, attackers can attempt to access it directly from the user's system.

            *   **1.1.2. [CRITICAL NODE] Bypass Access Controls (e.g., file permissions, lack of encryption)**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak file permissions on the user's operating system or the absence of encryption on locally stored data files.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Critical
                *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
                *   **Actionable Insights/Mitigation:**
                    *   **Mandatory Encryption:** Enforce strong encryption for all sensitive data at rest.
                    *   **Secure File Permissions:** Implement restrictive file permissions.
                    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run application with minimal necessary privileges.

            *   **1.1.3. [CRITICAL NODE] Decrypt Stored Data (if encryption is weak or key is accessible)**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If encryption is used but is weak (e.g., using easily guessable keys or weak algorithms) or if the encryption key is stored insecurely on the local system, attackers can attempt to decrypt the data.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
                *   **Impact:** Critical
                *   **Effort:** Medium-High
                *   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
                *   **Actionable Insights/Mitigation:**
                    *   **Robust Encryption:** Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
                    *   **Secure Key Management:** Implement secure key generation, storage, and access control. Avoid storing keys in the application code or easily accessible locations.

        *   **1.2. Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (if maybe-finance uses a local DB and application exposes it)**

                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application exposes an API that interacts with a local database (used by maybe-finance), and if input validation is insufficient, attackers might be able to inject malicious SQL queries to extract, modify, or delete data. While less common in purely local contexts, it's relevant if there's any API interaction with the database.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low
                *   **Impact:** Critical
                *   **Effort:** Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Medium
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Actionable Insights/Mitigation:**
                    *   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize all inputs to database queries, even in local-first contexts if APIs are involved.
                    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
                    *   **Principle of Least Exposure:** Limit direct database access from external sources.

            *   **2.1.2. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authorization Flaws (e.g., IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference, privilege escalation)**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in authorization logic, such as Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or privilege escalation vulnerabilities, to access data or perform actions beyond the attacker's authorized scope.
