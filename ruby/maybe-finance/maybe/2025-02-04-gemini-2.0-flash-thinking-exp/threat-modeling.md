# Threat Model Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `maybe-finance/maybe`. This could be done by crafting specific inputs or requests that trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impact can range from data breaches, complete system compromise (RCE), website defacement (XSS), to service unavailability (DoS).
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`, frontend libraries, backend frameworks).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `maybe-finance/maybe` dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline for projects using `maybe-finance/maybe`.
    *   Monitor security advisories for dependencies used by `maybe-finance/maybe`.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization mechanisms within `maybe-finance/maybe`. This could involve exploiting logic errors, insecure session management, or missing access controls to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, financial data, or administrative functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive financial data, account takeover, fraudulent transactions, data manipulation, and potential reputational damage.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Authentication modules, authorization middleware, user session management, API endpoints requiring authentication within `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test authentication and authorization code within `maybe-finance/maybe`.
    *   If extending or relying on `maybe-finance/maybe`'s auth, ensure robust and industry-standard mechanisms are used.
    *   Enforce principle of least privilege for authorization within the application using `maybe-finance/maybe`.
    *   Regularly audit access controls and permissions related to `maybe-finance/maybe`'s functionalities.

## Threat: [Data Validation and Sanitization Issues](./threats/data_validation_and_sanitization_issues.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or data through input fields or API requests processed by `maybe-finance/maybe` due to insufficient input validation or output sanitization. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or other injection attacks.
*   **Impact:** XSS can lead to account hijacking, data theft, website defacement. SQL Injection can lead to database compromise, data breaches, and data manipulation affecting data managed by `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Input handling functions, form processing, API endpoints, database query construction, output rendering logic within `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on all user inputs processed by `maybe-finance/maybe` (both client-side and server-side if applicable).
    *   Sanitize outputs generated by `maybe-finance/maybe` before rendering them in web pages to prevent XSS.
    *   Ensure `maybe-finance/maybe` uses parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions to prevent SQL Injection.

## Threat: [Business Logic Flaws in Financial Calculations and Data Handling](./threats/business_logic_flaws_in_financial_calculations_and_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input data or exploits flaws in the financial logic of `maybe-finance/maybe` to cause incorrect financial calculations, reports, or data inconsistencies. This could be used for financial gain or to disrupt the application's functionality relying on `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Impact:** Inaccurate financial data, incorrect budgeting, misleading reports generated by `maybe-finance/maybe`, financial misrepresentation, and potential financial losses for users relying on this data.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Financial calculation modules, budgeting algorithms, transaction processing logic, reporting functions within `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test financial logic and algorithms within `maybe-finance/maybe`.
    *   Implement unit tests and integration tests specifically for `maybe-finance/maybe`'s financial calculations.
    *   Validate financial data and calculations performed by `maybe-finance/maybe` independently within your application.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities](./threats/api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in APIs exposed by `maybe-finance/maybe`. This could include lack of authentication, authorization flaws, rate limiting weaknesses, or injection vulnerabilities in API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service against `maybe-finance/maybe`'s functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to functionalities provided by `maybe-finance/maybe`, data manipulation, service disruption, and potential server overload.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** API endpoints exposed by `maybe-finance/maybe`, API authentication and authorization mechanisms, API request handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust API authentication and authorization for `maybe-finance/maybe`'s APIs (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Enforce rate limiting on `maybe-finance/maybe`'s APIs to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
    *   Validate API inputs and sanitize outputs for `maybe-finance/maybe`'s API endpoints.
    *   Regularly audit API security and access controls for `maybe-finance/maybe`'s APIs.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure default settings within `maybe-finance/maybe` that are not properly hardened during deployment. This could include default credentials, exposed debug endpoints, or overly permissive access controls within `maybe-finance/maybe`'s configuration.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the system running `maybe-finance/maybe`, data breaches, system compromise, and potential service disruption.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Configuration files, default settings, deployment scripts, infrastructure configuration related to `maybe-finance/maybe`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change all default credentials of `maybe-finance/maybe` immediately upon deployment.
    *   Disable or remove unnecessary default features and services of `maybe-finance/maybe`.
