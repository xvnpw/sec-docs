# Threat Model Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Threat: [Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets](./threats/hardcoded_api_keyssecrets.md)

**Threat:** Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets

*   **Description:** An attacker might find API keys, client secrets, or other sensitive credentials required by `maybe` directly embedded in the application's source code. This could happen if developers inadvertently commit these secrets to version control or include them directly in configuration files used by the `maybe` integration.
*   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker could use these credentials to directly access the application's `maybe` integration and potentially the connected financial accounts, bypassing the application's security controls. They could retrieve financial data, potentially modify settings (if the API allows), or even initiate actions depending on the scope of the compromised keys.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Configuration handling, specifically the parts of the application that initialize the `maybe` client with API keys and secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration values used by `maybe`.
    *   Employ dedicated secrets management tools or services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for `maybe`'s credentials.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information related to `maybe` to version control. Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms.
    *   Regularly audit the codebase for accidentally hardcoded secrets used by `maybe`.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Configuration](./threats/insecure_storage_of_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Storage of Configuration

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, configuration YAML/JSON) that contain API keys or other sensitive information required by `maybe`. This could occur due to misconfigured server permissions, vulnerabilities in the server operating system, or insider threats, directly impacting the `maybe` integration.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to retrieve the `maybe` API keys and secrets, leading to unauthorized access to financial data and potential manipulation through the `maybe` library.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Configuration handling, where the application reads the API keys and secrets to initialize the `maybe` client.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files used by `maybe`.
    *   Encrypt configuration files at rest that contain `maybe`'s credentials.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information for `maybe` in easily accessible locations.
    *   Regularly audit server configurations and access controls related to `maybe`'s configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of User Credentials for Financial Institutions](./threats/insecure_handling_of_user_credentials_for_financial_institutions.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Handling of User Credentials for Financial Institutions

*   **Description:** If the application directly handles user credentials for connecting to financial institutions through `maybe` (e.g., storing usernames and passwords), an attacker could target these stored credentials. This directly impacts the security of the `maybe` integration.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of user credentials, allowing the attacker to directly access the user's financial accounts outside of the application, potentially bypassing the application entirely after gaining the credentials used with `maybe`.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Authentication and authorization within the application related to connecting financial accounts via `maybe`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing user credentials directly for use with `maybe`.
    *   Utilize secure token-based authentication flows provided by the financial institutions (e.g., OAuth 2.0) when connecting through `maybe`.
    *   If storing credentials for `maybe` is absolutely necessary, use strong encryption and secure storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `maybe` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__maybe__library.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `maybe` Library

*   **Description:** The `maybe` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in the deployed application using the library.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `maybe`, this could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to financial accounts through the library's functions, or other malicious activities directly exploiting the library's code.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** The `maybe` library itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `maybe` library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the `maybe` library.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `maybe`'s Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__maybe_'s_dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `maybe`'s Dependencies

*   **Description:** The `maybe` library relies on other third-party libraries. These dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited, indirectly affecting the application through the `maybe` library.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in `maybe` itself, this could lead to various security breaches, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the application by exploiting a flaw in a library used by `maybe`.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** The dependencies of the `maybe` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in the `maybe` library's dependencies.
    *   Keep `maybe`'s dependencies up-to-date.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Messages](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_error_messages.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Messages

*   **Description:** Error messages returned by the `maybe` library or the application's interaction with it might inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as API keys (if not properly handled within `maybe`'s error handling), internal IDs related to `maybe`'s operations, or details about the financial institution connection established by `maybe`.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could use this information to gain insights into the application's architecture or potential vulnerabilities in its use of `maybe`, making further attacks easier.
*   **Affected Maybe Component:** Error handling within the `maybe` library or the application's error handling of `maybe` interactions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement generic error handling for interactions with the `maybe` library.
    *   Avoid displaying detailed error messages from `maybe` to end-users.
    *   Log detailed error information from `maybe` securely for debugging purposes, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed in logs accessible to unauthorized parties.
