This section provides a detailed description of each component identified in the high-level architecture, including their responsibilities and potential technologies.

### 4.1 Client Applications

* **Web Browser (SPA):** The primary user interface, likely implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern JavaScript framework.
    * **Responsibilities:** Rendering the user interface, handling user interactions (input, navigation), communicating with the backend API via HTTP requests (likely RESTful).
    * **Potential Technologies:** React, Vue.js, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript.
* **Mobile App (Future/Separate):**  While not explicitly present in the initial repository, the project's scope suggests potential future development of native (iOS/Android) or cross-platform mobile applications. These might communicate with the same backend API.
    * **Responsibilities:** Providing a mobile-optimized user experience, leveraging device-specific features, communicating with the backend API.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android), React Native, Flutter.

### 4.2 Load Balancer / Reverse Proxy

* **Description:**  A crucial component for handling incoming traffic, distributing requests across multiple instances of the Backend API Gateway to ensure high availability and scalability. It often performs SSL termination and can provide basic security features.
    * **Responsibilities:** Load balancing requests, SSL/TLS termination, routing, potential web application firewall (WAF) integration, basic DDoS protection.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancing.

### 4.3 Backend API Gateway

* **Description:**  Acts as a central entry point for all client requests to the backend services. It decouples the frontend from the specific backend service implementations, enabling easier maintenance and evolution. It also handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication and authorization.
    * **Responsibilities:** Request routing to appropriate backend services, authentication and authorization enforcement (e.g., verifying JWT tokens), API composition (aggregating responses from multiple services), rate limiting to prevent abuse, request logging and monitoring.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Kong, Tyk, API Gateway (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### 4.4 Backend Services

These are independent, specialized services responsible for specific business functionalities.

* **Authentication Service (JWT based):** Manages user identities, registration, login, and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
    * **Responsibilities:** User registration and account creation, user authentication (username/password, potentially social logins), JWT generation and verification, password management (hashing and salting), handling password resets, potentially multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    * **Potential Technologies:**  Implementation within the chosen backend framework (e.g., Django REST Framework, Node.js with Passport.js), libraries for JWT handling.
* **Transaction Service (CRUD operations):** Handles the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of financial transactions.
    * **Responsibilities:** Storing and managing transaction details (date, amount, description, category, account), providing APIs for CRUD operations on transactions, potentially supporting transaction categorization and reconciliation logic.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Implementation within the chosen backend framework, interaction with the database ORM.
* **Account Service (Manages financial accounts):** Manages user financial accounts, including bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts.
    * **Responsibilities:** Creating and managing user accounts, linking external financial accounts (potentially via the Integration Service), tracking account balances, providing APIs for retrieving account information.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Implementation within the chosen backend framework, interaction with the database ORM.

    * **Responsibilities:** Allowing users to define budgets for different categories and time periods, tracking spending against defined budgets, generating budget reports and visualizations, potentially sending notifications for budget overruns.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Implementation within the chosen backend framework, potentially utilizing scheduled tasks or background jobs for budget tracking and notifications.
* **Reporting Service (Generates financial reports):** Generates various financial reports and visualizations based on user data, providing insights into their financial health.
    * **Responsibilities:** Aggregating and processing financial data, generating reports (e.g., income vs. expenses, net worth, cash flow), creating charts and visualizations, potentially allowing users to customize reports.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Implementation within the chosen backend framework, libraries for data analysis and visualization (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib in Python).
* **Integration Service (Plaid, other financial APIs):** Handles integrations with third-party financial institutions to automatically import transaction data and potentially retrieve account balances.
    * **Responsibilities:** Communicating with external APIs (e.g., Plaid, Finicity), securely handling API keys and secrets, transforming data received from external APIs into the application's data model, handling errors and retries for external API calls, potentially managing user authentication with external providers (OAuth).
    * **Potential Technologies:** Libraries specific to the integrated APIs (e.g., Plaid SDK), secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

### 4.5 Data Storage and Processing

* **Database (PostgreSQL):**  The primary relational database used for persistent storage of application data.
    * **Responsibilities:** Storing user accounts, transactions, budgets, account information, and other application data, ensuring data integrity and consistency, providing efficient data querying and retrieval.
    * **Potential Technologies:** PostgreSQL, potentially with extensions for specific needs.
* **Cache (Redis):**  An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data to improve application performance and reduce database load.
    * **Responsibilities:** Caching API responses, user session data, frequently accessed financial data, reducing latency for read operations.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Redis.
* **Background Job Processor (Celery):**  A distributed task queue used for executing asynchronous tasks outside the main request-response cycle.
    * **Responsibilities:** Handling time-consuming tasks like processing large datasets, syncing data with external services, sending emails or notifications, generating complex reports.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Celery (with a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ).
* **File Storage (AWS S3 or similar):**  Used for storing files such as user-uploaded documents (e.g., bank statements) or generated reports.
