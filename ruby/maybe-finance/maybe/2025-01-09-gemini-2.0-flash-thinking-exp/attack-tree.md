## Attack Tree Path: [1. Incorrect Conditional Logic with `isJust` and `isNothing` [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__incorrect_conditional_logic_with__isjust__and__isnothing___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * An attacker identifies flaws in the application's code where conditional statements rely on the `isJust()` or `isNothing()` methods of the `Maybe` type.
    * These flaws could involve:
        * **Incorrect negation:**  For example, using `isJust()` when `isNothing()` was intended, or vice-versa.
        * **Logical errors in complex conditions:** Combining `isJust()`/`isNothing()` with other conditions in a way that creates unintended execution paths.
        * **Missing checks:**  Failing to use `isJust()` or `isNothing()` at all in situations where a `Nothing` value is possible.
    * By manipulating input or application state, the attacker can force the application to enter the unintended execution path.
    * This can lead to:
        * **Bypassing security checks:**  For instance, a check to verify user permissions might be skipped if a `Maybe` containing user data is incorrectly evaluated as `Just` or `Nothing`.
        * **Circumventing business logic:**  A condition that should prevent a certain action might be bypassed, allowing unauthorized operations.
        * **Data manipulation:**  Logic that relies on the presence of a value might execute even when the `Maybe` is `Nothing`, potentially leading to incorrect data updates or creations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Logic Errors in Core `Maybe` Operations (`map`, `flatMap`, `orElse`, etc.) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__logic_errors_in_core__maybe__operations___map____flatmap____orelse___etc____critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * This scenario assumes a vulnerability exists within the `maybe-finance/maybe` library itself.
    * An attacker discovers a flaw in the implementation of core methods like `map`, `flatMap`, `orElse`, or others.
    * This flaw could be a subtle bug in the logic that causes these methods to behave unexpectedly under certain conditions.
    * The attacker then crafts specific input or manipulates the application state in a way that triggers this bug.
    * This can result in:
        * **Incorrect Data Transformation:** The `map` or `flatMap` functions might alter data in an unintended way, leading to data corruption or incorrect calculations.
        * **Unexpected Side Effects:**  The flawed logic might cause unintended actions or modifications to the application's state, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or instability.
        * **Denial of Service:** In some cases, a logic error could lead to infinite loops or resource exhaustion, causing the application to become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Prototype Pollution or Unexpected Side Effects [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__prototype_pollution_or_unexpected_side_effects__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * This scenario also assumes a vulnerability within the `maybe-finance/maybe` library.
    * An attacker discovers that the library's code, perhaps unintentionally, modifies the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects (like `Object`, `Array`, etc.) or introduces unexpected side effects.
    * This could happen if the library incorrectly manipulates object properties or uses techniques that have unintended global consequences.
    * The attacker might not directly interact with the `Maybe` library itself, but rather exploit the consequences of this prototype pollution.
    * This can lead to:
        * **Modifying Global Objects:**  The attacker could inject malicious properties or methods into core JavaScript objects, affecting the behavior of the entire application and potentially other libraries.
        * **Introducing Security Vulnerabilities:**  By manipulating prototypes, an attacker could bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access, or execute arbitrary code. For example, they might be able to inject a malicious function into the prototype of a commonly used object, which is then executed by the application.
        * **Unpredictable Application Behavior:**  Prototype pollution can lead to very subtle and difficult-to-debug issues, making the application unstable and unreliable.
