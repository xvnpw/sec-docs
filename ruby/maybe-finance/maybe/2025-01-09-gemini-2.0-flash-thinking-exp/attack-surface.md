# Attack Surface Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities when `maybe` converts serialized data back into objects. If this data originates from an untrusted source and `maybe` handles it, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service *within the context of the application using maybe*.

**How maybe contributes to the attack surface:** If `maybe` itself serializes/deserializes financial data or internal state without proper safeguards, attackers might be able to inject malicious serialized objects that `maybe` processes.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object representing financial transaction data. If the application provides this data to `maybe` for processing and `maybe` deserializes it without validation, it could execute arbitrary code embedded within the object.

**Impact:** Critical - Potential for remote code execution, leading to full system compromise or significant data breaches *due to the exploitation of maybe's deserialization*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid configuring `maybe` to deserialize data from untrusted sources if possible.
*   If `maybe`'s functionality requires deserialization of external data, use secure deserialization methods and validate the integrity and origin of the serialized data *before passing it to maybe*.
*   Implement input validation on the deserialized data *after it has been processed by maybe* to ensure it conforms to expected structures and values.
*   Regularly update the serialization libraries used *by maybe* and the application to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation on Financial Data](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_on_financial_data.md)

**Description:** Insufficient validation of financial data *directly processed by the maybe library*. Attackers can provide malicious input to `maybe` to cause unexpected behavior, errors, or security breaches.

**How maybe contributes to the attack surface:** As a finance-focused library, `maybe`'s core functionality involves handling various financial inputs (transaction amounts, account balances, etc.). Lack of robust validation *within maybe's code* exposes the application.

**Example:** An attacker provides an extremely large or negative value for a transaction amount that is directly processed by a function within `maybe`. If `maybe` doesn't validate this, it could lead to integer overflow/underflow, incorrect calculations *within maybe's logic*, or application crashes.

**Impact:** High - Potential for financial manipulation, data corruption, or denial of service *resulting from flaws in maybe's input handling*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize `maybe`'s functionalities in a way that allows for pre-validation of financial data *before it reaches maybe's core processing functions*.
*   If `maybe` offers configuration options for input validation, ensure they are enabled and configured with strict rules.
*   Implement additional input validation *around the usage of maybe*, specifically targeting the data being passed to and received from the library.
*   Report any observed insufficient input validation within `maybe` to the library maintainers.

## Attack Surface: [Financial Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/financial_logic_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from errors or oversights in the core financial algorithms and logic *implemented within the maybe library itself*.

**How maybe contributes to the attack surface:** As a financial library, the core functionality of `maybe` involves financial calculations and logic. Flaws *within maybe's algorithms* directly translate to application vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A bug in `maybe`'s interest calculation logic allows attackers to manipulate input parameters passed to `maybe` to artificially inflate interest earned or reduce interest paid *through maybe's calculations*.

**Impact:** High - Potential for direct financial loss, inaccurate reporting, and regulatory non-compliance *due to errors in maybe's financial logic*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test the application's usage of `maybe`'s financial logic with various inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   Compare the results of `maybe`'s calculations with independent calculations to identify discrepancies.
*   Stay updated with any bug fixes or security patches released by the `maybe` library maintainers that address financial logic errors.
*   Consider the impact of potential financial logic flaws in `maybe` when designing the application's financial workflows.
