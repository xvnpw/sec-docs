# Threat Model Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Threat: [API Endpoint Spoofing](./threats/api_endpoint_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets up a fake API endpoint that mimics a legitimate `maybe-finance/maybe` API endpoint (e.g., `api.maybe.finance/v1/accounts`). They might use techniques like DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning, or compromising a proxy server to redirect traffic to their malicious endpoint. The attacker aims to intercept user credentials, API keys, or financial data.  This directly involves Maybe because the attacker is impersonating *their* API.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, theft of financial data, unauthorized transactions, loss of user trust, and potential legal and financial repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:**  API Client (the part of the library that makes requests to Maybe's API), potentially the configuration module (where API endpoints are defined).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement TLS certificate pinning for Maybe's API endpoints (if supported and feasible). This ensures the application only communicates with servers presenting a specific, pre-defined certificate.
        *   **Developer:** Validate the hostname and certificate chain rigorously, going beyond standard TLS checks.
        *   **Developer:** Use a robust and well-vetted HTTP client library.
        *   **Developer:** Monitor for unexpected changes in API responses or latency.

## Threat: [Compromised Dependency Injection (within `maybe-finance/maybe`)](./threats/compromised_dependency_injection__within__maybe-financemaybe__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency *used by the `maybe-finance/maybe` library itself*. This could be a direct dependency or a transitive dependency. The attacker injects malicious code into the compromised dependency, which is then executed when the `maybe-finance/maybe` library is used. This is a direct threat to Maybe because the vulnerability exists *within their library's dependency tree*.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the context of the application *through the Maybe library*, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to financial accounts, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any component of the `maybe-finance/maybe` library, depending on where the compromised dependency is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maybe Team:** (Primarily Maybe's responsibility) Use a dependency management tool with vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, `Dependabot`).
        *   **Maybe Team:** Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Consider dependency locking.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Audit the source code of critical dependencies.
        *   **Developer:** (Secondary mitigation) Regularly update the `maybe-finance/maybe` library to benefit from Maybe's dependency updates.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Transit (Account Linking, within Maybe's control)](./threats/data_tampering_in_transit__account_linking__within_maybe's_control_.md)

*   **Description:** During the account linking process (e.g., OAuth flow), an attacker intercepts and modifies the data exchanged *between `maybe-finance/maybe` and the financial institution*. This assumes Maybe's infrastructure is involved in proxying or mediating this communication. They might alter the authorization code, access token, or user consent parameters. This is a direct threat if Maybe's servers are the point of interception.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the user's financial accounts, link the wrong accounts, or escalate their privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Account Linking Module (the part of the library that handles the OAuth flow or other account connection mechanisms), specifically the communication pathways *within Maybe's control*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maybe Team:** (Primarily Maybe's responsibility) Rely on HTTPS (TLS) for all communication. Ensure proper TLS configuration and certificate validation.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for OAuth flows.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Validate all parameters received from the financial institution.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Implement state parameters in the OAuth flow.
        *   **Developer:** (Secondary mitigation) Ensure the application is using the latest version of the `maybe-finance/maybe` library.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation (Transaction Data, within Maybe's API)](./threats/insufficient_input_validation__transaction_data__within_maybe's_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `maybe-finance/maybe` library's *API* doesn't sufficiently validate transaction data received from the application before sending it to the financial institution. An attacker could inject malicious data (e.g., script tags, SQL queries) into transaction parameters, exploiting vulnerabilities *in the financial institution's systems via Maybe's API*. This is a direct threat to Maybe because the vulnerability exists *within their API*.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability in the financial institution's API, this could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or other injection attacks. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized transactions, or account compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Transaction Processing Module (the part of the library that handles creating and submitting transactions), specifically the *API endpoint* handling transaction data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maybe Team:** (Primarily Maybe's responsibility) Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the API side. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases (if applicable).
        *   **Maybe Team:** Encode data appropriately before sending it to the financial institution.
        *   **Developer:** (Secondary mitigation) Implement robust input validation on the *application* side as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [API Key Exposure (leading to unauthorized use of Maybe's services)](./threats/api_key_exposure__leading_to_unauthorized_use_of_maybe's_services_.md)

*   **Description:** Although the *exposure* might happen in the application code, the *impact* is directly on Maybe's services. An exposed `maybe-finance/maybe` API key allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests to Maybe's API, potentially on behalf of the compromised application and its users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application's Maybe account, potentially leading to data breaches (of data Maybe holds), financial losses (if Maybe charges per API call), or reputational damage to Maybe. The attacker could potentially access data for *all* users of the application, impacting Maybe's infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Configuration Module (within Maybe's infrastructure, managing API key authentication), and any API endpoint that relies on API key authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Store API keys securely (environment variables, secrets management).
        *   **Developer:** Never hardcode API keys.
        *   **Developer:** Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing keys.
        *   **Developer:** Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   **Maybe Team:** (Shared responsibility) Implement API key rotation mechanisms and encourage their use.
        *   **Maybe Team:** Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious API usage patterns associated with a given API key.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Logging (within `maybe-finance/maybe`)](./threats/data_leakage_through_logging__within__maybe-financemaybe__.md)

*   **Description:**  The `maybe-finance/maybe` *library itself* logs sensitive data (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens, account numbers) in plain text. An attacker with access to the logs *generated by the library* could gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability is within the library's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, theft of financial data.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Logging Module (within the `maybe-finance/maybe` library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maybe Team:** (Primarily Maybe's responsibility) Implement secure logging practices within the library. Avoid logging sensitive data. Use redaction or masking.
        *   **Developer:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on Maybe's implementation) Ensure the application is using the latest version of the library.

## Threat: [Outdated `maybe-finance/maybe` Library Version (containing known vulnerabilities)](./threats/outdated__maybe-financemaybe__library_version__containing_known_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of the `maybe-finance/maybe` library that contains known security vulnerabilities *within the library itself*.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities *in the Maybe library* to compromise the application, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `maybe-finance/maybe` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Regularly update the `maybe-finance/maybe` library to the latest stable version.
        *   **Developer:** Use a dependency management tool with vulnerability scanning.
