        *   *Not* perform the calculation.
    5.  **Document the limits *in maybe's documentation*:** Clearly document input limits in `maybe`'s API reference.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeouts (within `maybe`'s Functions)](./mitigation_strategies/timeouts__within__maybe_'s_functions_.md)

    4.  **Handle timeouts gracefully *within maybe*:** If a timeout occurs, `maybe`'s functions should:
        *   Terminate the calculation.
        *   Throw a specific exception.
        *   Provide a clear error message.
        *   *Not* return a partial result.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Memory Management (If Applicable to `maybe`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_memory_management__if_applicable_to__maybe__.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Determine if `maybe` uses manual memory management:** Check if the library is written in a language like C++ or Rust where memory is managed manually. If it's in a garbage-collected language (like JavaScript or Python), this strategy is less relevant.
    2. **Identify areas handling sensitive data *within maybe*:** Pinpoint the parts of `maybe`'s code where sensitive financial data is stored in memory.
    3. **Implement secure wiping *within maybe*:** Before deallocating memory that held sensitive data *within maybe*, overwrite it with zeros (or a secure random pattern) to prevent data remnants. Use appropriate functions for secure wiping (e.g., `memset_s` in C, `explicit_bzero` in some libraries).
    4. **Test the wiping mechanism *as part of maybe's tests*:** Add tests to `maybe`'s test suite to verify that memory wiping is working correctly. This might involve using memory analysis tools.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Data Leakage of Sensitive Financial Information (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed through memory remnants *if maybe handles such data directly*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces the risk *if manual memory management is used within maybe* (e.g., 90%+). If `maybe` uses a garbage-collected language, the impact is minimal, as the garbage collector handles memory deallocation.

* **Currently Implemented (within `maybe`):**
    * Dependent on the language used by `maybe`. Unlikely to be fully implemented if manual memory management is used.

* **Missing Implementation (within `maybe`):**
    * Identification of sensitive data handling *within maybe*.
    * Implementation of secure wiping *within maybe's code*.
    * Testing of the wiping mechanism *as part of maybe's tests*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear Error Handling and Reporting (within `maybe`)](./mitigation_strategies/clear_error_handling_and_reporting__within__maybe__.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify all points of failure *within maybe*:** Determine all locations in `maybe`'s code where errors can occur (e.g., invalid input, calculation failures, resource exhaustion).
    2. **Define specific exception types *for maybe*:** Create custom exception classes (or use appropriate built-in ones) to represent different types of errors that can occur *within maybe*.
    3. **Throw exceptions consistently *within maybe*:** Whenever an error occurs *in maybe*, throw the appropriate exception.
    4. **Provide informative error messages *from maybe*:** Include clear and concise error messages that explain the cause of the error and, if possible, suggest corrective actions. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    5. **Log errors (optionally, within `maybe` or in the consuming application):** If `maybe` includes logging functionality, log errors with sufficient detail for debugging. Ensure sensitive data is redacted. If logging is handled by the consuming application, ensure `maybe` provides enough context in its exceptions.
    6. **Document error handling *in maybe's documentation*:** Clearly describe the different types of exceptions that `maybe` can throw and how to handle them.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Incorrect or Misleading Financial Calculations (Severity: Critical):** Prevents `maybe` from returning potentially incorrect results when errors occur.
    * **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Avoids exposing sensitive information in error messages.

* **Impact:**
    * **Incorrect Calculations:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that errors are handled explicitly and do not lead to silent failures or incorrect outputs *from maybe*.
    * **Data Leakage:** Moderately reduces the risk by preventing sensitive information from being included in error messages *generated by maybe*.

* **Currently Implemented (within `maybe`):**
    * Likely partially implemented, but may lack consistency and specific exception types.

* **Missing Implementation (within `maybe`):**
    * Consistent use of specific exception types *throughout maybe*.
    * Informative error messages *from maybe*.
    * Comprehensive documentation of error handling *in maybe's documentation*.
    * Secure logging practices (if logging is included *within maybe*).
