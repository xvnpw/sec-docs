## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Maybe's Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_maybe's_data_handling.md)

*   **1.1 Input Validation**

    *   **1.1.1 Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Financial Data [!]**
        *   **Description:** The *integrating application* fails to properly validate the format, range, or type of financial data (e.g., transaction amounts, dates, account numbers) before passing it to the `maybe` library. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on the integrating application)
        *   **Impact:** High (Data corruption, potential for injection attacks)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Logs might show unusual data)

*   **1.2 Data Sanitization**

    *   **1.2.1 Failure to Sanitize Data Before Internal Use [!]**
        *   **Description:** The *integrating application* fails to sanitize data received from or processed by `maybe` before using it internally (e.g., in calculations, string formatting, or database queries). This can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on Maybe's internal implementation and the integrating application)
        *   **Impact:** High (Potential for various injection vulnerabilities)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on how the integrating application uses the data)

    *   **1.2.2 Inadequate Encoding/Escaping [!]**
        *   **Description:** The *integrating application* fails to properly encode or escape data received from `maybe` before displaying it in a user interface. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Shared responsibility with the integrating application)
        *   **Impact:** High (XSS, other injection vulnerabilities)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Visible in rendered output, potentially)
*  **1.3 Data Storage**
    *   **1.3.2 Hardcoded Secrets [!]**
        *    **Description:** The `maybe` library or, more likely, the integrating application, contains hardcoded API keys, secrets, or credentials. These could be extracted by an attacker.
        *    **Likelihood:** Very Low (This is a major security flaw and unlikely in a public repo, but possible in the integrating application)
        *    **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of connected services)
        *    **Effort:** Very Low
        *    **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *    **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Visible in the codebase)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Weaknesses in Maybe's API Integrations](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_weaknesses_in_maybe's_api_integrations.md)

*   **2.1 Third-Party API Keys**

    *   **2.1.1 Exposure of API Keys [!]**
        *   **Description:** API keys used by `maybe` or the integrating application for third-party financial services are exposed (e.g., in logs, source code, configuration files, or environment variables that are not properly secured).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If best practices are followed)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Compromise of third-party accounts)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (If keys are exposed)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If keys are exposed in logs, code, etc.)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Attack Maybe's Dependency Chain](./attack_tree_paths/3__attack_maybe's_dependency_chain.md)

*   **3.1 Supply Chain Attack**

    *   **3.1.1 Compromised Dependency [!]**
        *   **Description:** A library that `maybe` depends on is compromised by a malicious actor, injecting malicious code into `maybe` and, consequently, the integrating application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (But increasing in frequency)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Very High (Requires compromising a dependency)
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Requires advanced security analysis)
    *   **3.1.2 Typosquatting [!]**
        *    **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with a name similar to a legitimate dependency of `maybe`, tricking developers into installing the malicious package.
        *    **Likelihood:** Low (Requires careful review of dependencies)
        *    **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
        *    **Effort:** Medium (Requires creating and publishing a malicious package)
        *    **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *    **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful code review)

*   **3.2 Dependency Confusion**
    *   **3.2.1 Internal Dependency Name Collision [!]**
        *   **Description:** If `maybe` uses an internal dependency with the same name as a public package, an attacker could potentially trick the build system into using the public (malicious) package instead.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific naming conventions)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
        *   **Effort:** High (Requires exploiting a specific misconfiguration)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires understanding the build process)

    *   **3.2.2 Misconfigured Package Manager [!]**
        *   **Description:** If the package manager used to install `maybe` and its dependencies is misconfigured, it might pull dependencies from an untrusted source, leading to the installation of malicious code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific misconfiguration)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
        *   **Effort:** High (Requires exploiting a specific misconfiguration)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires understanding the build process)
