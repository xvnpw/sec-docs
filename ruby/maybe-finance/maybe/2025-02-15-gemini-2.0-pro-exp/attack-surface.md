# Attack Surface Analysis for maybe-finance/maybe

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise (Direct `maybe` Access)](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise__direct__maybe__access_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to API key(s) or user-specific access tokens used to authenticate with the `maybe` API. *This focuses on the compromise enabling direct access to `maybe`, not just through the application.*
    *   **How `maybe` Contributes:**  `maybe`'s security model relies on the secrecy of these credentials. The very existence of these keys for accessing `maybe` creates this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the `maybe` platform itself (e.g., a database breach at `maybe`) and obtains API keys, or phishes a `maybe` user directly for their credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can directly access and potentially modify all data accessible to the compromised key/token within the `maybe` platform, *bypassing the application entirely*. This includes viewing, modifying, or deleting sensitive financial information.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Focus on `maybe` interaction):**
        *   **Least Privilege (within `maybe`):** Ensure API keys used by the application have the absolute minimum permissions *within the `maybe` platform*. This limits the damage if a key is compromised *outside* the application.
        *   **`maybe` Platform Security:** This is primarily `maybe`'s responsibility, but users should choose a provider with strong security practices (audits, certifications, etc.).
        *   **User Education (for `maybe` users):** Educate users about phishing and other attacks that could compromise their `maybe` credentials directly.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (within `maybe`):** If `maybe` offers MFA, strongly encourage or require its use. This adds a layer of security even if credentials are stolen.
        * **Monitor maybe API logs:** Monitor maybe API logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive API Access (Within `maybe`)](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_api_access__within__maybe__.md)

*   **Description:**  The API key or user token used by the application has more permissions *within the `maybe` platform* than are strictly required.
    *   **How `maybe` Contributes:**  `maybe`'s permission model (its internal access control system) directly determines the scope of access.
    *   **Example:**  The application only needs to *read* budget data, but the API key configured *within `maybe`* has permission to *write* (create, modify, delete) budget data.
    *   **Impact:**  If the API key is compromised (even through a vulnerability *outside* the application), the attacker has a wider range of actions they can perform directly within `maybe`.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Focus on `maybe` configuration):**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (within `maybe`):**  Configure the `maybe` API key/token with the absolute minimum permissions needed. This is a configuration setting *within the `maybe` platform itself*.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (within `maybe`):**  If `maybe` supports RBAC, use it to define specific roles with limited permissions and assign those roles to API keys/tokens *within the `maybe` system*.
        *   **Regular Audits (of `maybe` permissions):**  Periodically review the permissions granted to API keys/tokens *within the `maybe` platform* to ensure they remain appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks Targeting the `maybe` API](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_targeting_the__maybe__api.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied input, if not properly handled by the application, could allow an attacker to inject malicious parameters or commands into requests sent to the *`maybe` API*.
    *   **How `maybe` Contributes:** The `maybe` API's design and input handling are directly responsible for its vulnerability (or resistance) to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** The application uses user input to construct a search query to the `maybe` API. If the `maybe` API doesn't properly sanitize this input, an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the `maybe` API. Could range from data leakage to data modification or even code execution *within the `maybe` platform* itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the `maybe` API)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Focus on interaction with `maybe`):**
        *   **Use `maybe`'s Provided Client Library (Safely):** If `maybe` provides a client library, use it *correctly*. These libraries often include built-in protections against injection attacks (e.g., parameterized queries). *Do not bypass these protections.*
        *   **Understand `maybe`'s API Security:** Thoroughly review the `maybe` API documentation to understand its security recommendations and requirements for safe input handling.
        *   **If Building Raw Requests:** If you *must* construct raw API requests (not recommended), follow `maybe`'s specific instructions for escaping and sanitizing data. *Do not guess.*
