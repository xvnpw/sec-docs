# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable safe and reliable refactoring of critical code paths in production environments.
  - Reduce the risk of introducing regressions or performance issues during code changes.
  - Facilitate iterative and incremental improvements to existing systems.
  - Improve developer confidence in making changes to complex code.
- Business Risks:
  - Introduction of bugs or performance degradation in production due to refactoring errors.
  - Potential for service disruption or downtime if refactoring introduces critical issues.
  - Increased development time and cost if refactoring process is not efficient or reliable.
  - Negative impact on user experience if refactoring leads to unexpected behavior.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository hosting with standard GitHub security features (access control, audit logs). Implemented by: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Open source project with community review and contributions. Implemented by: Open source nature of the project.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies of the library.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities introduced by community contributions.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in gem dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to identify potential security issues in the library code.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Document secure development guidelines for contributors.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as this is a library. Authentication is handled by the applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable as this is a library. Authorization is handled by the applications using the library.
  - Input Validation: The library should perform input validation on any external data it processes to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the applications using it.
  - Cryptography:  The library itself does not appear to require cryptography. However, applications using the library might handle sensitive data and should implement appropriate cryptographic measures independently.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Safe and reliable code refactoring in production.
  - Maintaining application stability and performance during code changes.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The Scientist library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, applications using the library might process sensitive data. The risk is that incorrect refactoring using Scientist could indirectly expose or corrupt sensitive data handled by the consuming applications. The sensitivity of data depends on the applications using the library and is not inherent to the library itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific applications or systems where the Scientist library will be used within the organization?
  - What are the existing security practices and tools used in the organization's software development lifecycle?
  - What is the organization's risk tolerance for production incidents caused by refactoring errors?
  - Are there specific compliance requirements that need to be considered when using the Scientist library?
- Assumptions:
  - The Scientist library will be used to refactor critical code paths in production environments.
  - The organization prioritizes minimizing the risk of production incidents and data corruption.
  - The organization has a software development team familiar with Ruby and RubyGems.
  - The organization has monitoring systems in place to observe application behavior in production.
