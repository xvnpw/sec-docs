    *   **MFA System Integration:** Integrating an MFA system with the feature flag management system.
    *   **User Onboarding and Training:**  Educating users about MFA and providing clear instructions on how to use it.
    *   **Support and Recovery:** Establishing procedures for user support and account recovery in case of MFA issues (e.g., lost devices).

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Mandatory MFA:** Enforce MFA for all users accessing the feature flag management system, especially those with permissions to manage experiment flags.
    *   **User Education:**  Provide clear communication and training to users about the importance of MFA and how to use it effectively.
    *   **MFA Method Variety:** Consider offering multiple MFA methods (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens, SMS codes - while SMS is less secure, it can be an option for less critical accounts or as a fallback). Prioritize more secure methods like authenticator apps.
    *   **Regular MFA Audits:** Periodically audit MFA implementation and usage to ensure effectiveness and identify any potential weaknesses.

#### 4.4. Component 4: Implement audit logging for all feature flag changes related to `scientist` experiments
