# Attack Tree Analysis for github/scientist

Objective: Compromise application functionality or data by exploiting weaknesses in the integration or usage of the Github's Scientist library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Sub-Tree:**

*   Root: Compromise Application Using Scientist [CRITICAL]
    *   AND 1: Exploit Experiment Configuration [CRITICAL]
        *   OR 1.1: Inject Malicious Code via Experiment Definition [CRITICAL]
            *   1.1.1: Supply Malicious Code in `use` Blocks (if dynamically loaded/evaluated) *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
            *   1.1.2: Influence Experiment Logic via Untrusted Input *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        *   OR 1.3: Expose Sensitive Data in Experiment Context [CRITICAL]
            *   1.3.1: Include Secrets in Control/Candidate Blocks *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
            *   1.3.2: Log Sensitive Data During Experiment Execution *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    *   AND 3: Exploit Observation and Reporting Mechanisms
        *   OR 3.2: Manipulate Reporting Output
            *   3.2.1: Suppress Error Reporting for Malicious Candidate *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
            *   3.2.2: Falsify Success Reports for Compromised Functionality [CRITICAL]

## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application Using Scientist [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_using_scientist__critical_.md)

*   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and is therefore a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1: Exploit Experiment Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_exploit_experiment_configuration__critical_.md)

*   Configuration flaws are often the easiest entry points for attackers and can have significant consequences, making this a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.1: Inject Malicious Code via Experiment Definition [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_1_inject_malicious_code_via_experiment_definition__critical_.md)

*   Successful code injection grants the attacker significant control over the application, making this a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1: Supply Malicious Code in `use` Blocks (if dynamically loaded/evaluated) *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_supply_malicious_code_in__use__blocks__if_dynamically_loadedevaluated___high-risk_path.md)

*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: Critical
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Advanced
*   Detection Difficulty: Hard
*   Justification: Direct code injection leads to full compromise. Though likelihood is low due to the need for dynamic evaluation, the impact is so severe it constitutes a high-risk path if that capability exists.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2: Influence Experiment Logic via Untrusted Input *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_influence_experiment_logic_via_untrusted_input__high-risk_path.md)

*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   Justification: Relatively easy to achieve and can significantly alter application behavior. The combination of medium likelihood and high impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.3: Expose Sensitive Data in Experiment Context [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_3_expose_sensitive_data_in_experiment_context__critical_.md)

*   Exposure of sensitive data can have immediate and severe consequences, making this a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1: Include Secrets in Control/Candidate Blocks *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_include_secrets_in_controlcandidate_blocks__high-risk_path.md)

*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: Critical
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Beginner
*   Detection Difficulty: Easy
*   Justification: A common mistake with severe consequences. The ease of execution and critical impact make this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2: Log Sensitive Data During Experiment Execution *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_log_sensitive_data_during_experiment_execution__high-risk_path.md)

*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Beginner
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   Justification: Another common mistake leading to sensitive data exposure. The combination of medium likelihood and high impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1: Suppress Error Reporting for Malicious Candidate *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_suppress_error_reporting_for_malicious_candidate__high-risk_path.md)

*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   Justification: While the likelihood is low, successfully suppressing error reporting can lead to the deployment of a flawed or malicious candidate, making this a high-risk path to monitor.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2: Falsify Success Reports for Compromised Functionality [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_falsify_success_reports_for_compromised_functionality__critical_.md)

*   Likelihood: Very Low
*   Impact: Critical
*   Effort: High
*   Skill Level: Advanced
*   Detection Difficulty: Hard
*   Justification: Although very low likelihood, the impact of believing a compromised function is safe is critical. This node represents a failure in the core validation process.
