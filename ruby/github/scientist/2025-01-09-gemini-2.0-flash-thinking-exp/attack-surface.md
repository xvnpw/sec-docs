# Attack Surface Analysis for github/scientist

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Stored Experiment Definitions](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_stored_experiment_definitions.md)

**Description:** Experiment configurations, including the code for the control and candidate branches, are stored in a way that is accessible or modifiable by unauthorized individuals.

**How Scientist Contributes:** `scientist` directly executes the code defined in these experiment configurations. If the storage is insecure, `scientist` will run potentially malicious code.

**Example:** Experiment definitions are stored in a plain text configuration file accessible by a web server user. An attacker modifies this file to inject malicious code into the candidate branch, which `scientist` then executes.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, arbitrary code execution within the application context, data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store experiment definitions in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
* Encrypt sensitive parts of the experiment configuration, such as code snippets.
* Implement strict access control mechanisms for configuration files or databases.
* Avoid storing executable code directly in configuration files; use references to existing, well-vetted code.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on Experiment Names or Context](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_experiment_names_or_context.md)

**Description:** The application allows user-provided input to influence the name or context of `scientist` experiments without proper sanitization or validation, and this input is then used in logging or other operations related to the experiment execution.

**How Scientist Contributes:** `scientist`'s workflow often involves logging or reporting information about the experiments, including their names or context. If this information is derived from unsanitized user input, it can lead to vulnerabilities when `scientist` or the application processes these logs.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious experiment name containing special characters or code injection payloads. This name is logged by the application as part of `scientist`'s experiment execution, leading to log injection vulnerabilities when the logs are processed.

**Impact:** Log injection, potentially leading to information disclosure or command execution if logs are processed insecurely.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in experiment names or context.
* Use parameterized logging to prevent log injection attacks when logging information related to `scientist` experiments.
* Avoid directly using unsanitized user input in any code execution paths related to `scientist`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Comparison Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_comparison_logic.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom comparison logic for experiment results that contains flaws or vulnerabilities.

**How Scientist Contributes:** `scientist` relies on this custom logic to determine the outcome of experiments. Vulnerabilities here can lead to incorrect conclusions and the introduction of flawed or malicious code.

**Example:** A custom comparison function incorrectly handles data types, allowing a malicious candidate branch to produce results that are falsely considered equivalent to the control branch.

**Impact:** Introduction of subtle bugs or malicious code into the production environment that is not detected by the experiment framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test custom comparison logic with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and potential attack vectors.
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing comparison functions.
* Consider using well-established and vetted comparison libraries or techniques where possible.
* Implement robust logging of comparison results for auditing and debugging.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data Through Experiment Results](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_experiment_results.md)

**Description:** The logging or observation mechanisms used by `scientist` inadvertently expose sensitive data processed during the experiment.

**How Scientist Contributes:** `scientist`'s core function involves observing and potentially logging the behavior and outputs of both the control and candidate code. If the application doesn't sanitize this data before logging, sensitive information can be exposed.

**Example:** The application logs the full request and response bodies of API calls made by both the control and candidate branches during a `scientist` experiment, potentially exposing API keys or personally identifiable information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations, potential compromise of user accounts or systems.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict data sanitization and redaction before logging or reporting experiment results from `scientist`.
* Avoid logging sensitive data unnecessarily within the context of `scientist` experiments.
* Use secure logging mechanisms with appropriate access controls.
* Review and audit logging configurations related to `scientist` regularly.
