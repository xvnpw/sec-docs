# Threat Model Analysis for github/scientist

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution in Experiment Branch](./threats/malicious_code_execution_in_experiment_branch.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially through compromised configuration or vulnerabilities in how the application defines and executes Scientist experiments, could influence the code executed within the experimental branch. This could involve injecting malicious logic.

**Impact:** Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The `use` block within a `Science` experiment where the experimental code defined using Scientist's API is executed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test all experimental code defined within Scientist experiments before deployment.
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any data that influences the experimental branch's execution within the `use` block.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to the experimental code defined using Scientist, limiting its access to resources.
*   Secure the mechanisms used to configure and define Scientist experiments, preventing unauthorized modification.

## Threat: [Data Corruption by Faulty Experiment Code](./threats/data_corruption_by_faulty_experiment_code.md)

**Description:** A bug or flaw in the experimental code *integrated through the Scientist framework* could lead to unintended modifications or corruption of data within the application's storage. The Scientist library facilitates the execution of this potentially faulty code.

**Impact:** Leads to inconsistent data states, application errors, and potentially loss of data integrity.

**Affected Component:** The experimental code path executed within the `use` block of a `Science` experiment. The `Science` class itself orchestrates this execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust data validation and verification within the experimental code executed by Scientist.
*   Utilize database transactions or other mechanisms to ensure atomicity and rollback capabilities for data modifications within the experimental branch managed by Scientist.
*   Isolate data modifications performed by the experimental code within Scientist experiments where possible.
*   Implement comprehensive testing, including integration tests, for the experimental code paths managed by Scientist.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Experiment Logging](./threats/information_disclosure_through_experiment_logging.md)

**Description:** The experimental code *executed via the Scientist framework* might inadvertently log sensitive information during its execution. The Scientist library doesn't inherently log, but it facilitates the execution of code that might.

**Impact:** Could lead to the compromise of sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** The logging mechanisms used within the experimental code executed by Scientist.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict controls over what data is logged within the experimental code integrated with Scientist.
*   Sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging within the experimental branches.
*   Securely configure and manage log files.
*   Regularly review application logs.
