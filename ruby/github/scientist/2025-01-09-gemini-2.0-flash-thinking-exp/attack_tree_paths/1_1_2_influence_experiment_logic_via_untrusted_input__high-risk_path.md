## Deep Analysis: Attack Tree Path 1.1.2 - Influence Experiment Logic via Untrusted Input

This document provides a detailed analysis of the attack tree path **1.1.2: Influence Experiment Logic via Untrusted Input**, focusing on the potential risks and mitigation strategies for an application utilizing the `github/scientist` library.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path centers around the ability of an attacker to manipulate the core decision-making process of the `scientist` library. `Scientist` facilitates A/B testing by running two code paths (the "control" and the "experiment") and comparing their results. Successfully influencing this logic means an attacker can force the application to consistently choose a specific code path, regardless of the intended experimental design.

The "Untrusted Input" component highlights the source of the attacker's leverage. This input could originate from various sources, including:

* **HTTP Request Headers:**  Custom headers, cookies, user-agent strings.
* **Query Parameters:**  Values passed in the URL.
* **Request Body:**  Data submitted via POST requests (e.g., JSON, form data).
* **External Data Sources:**  Configuration files, databases, or other external services if their content is influenced by user input.
* **Environment Variables:** While less common for direct user influence, misconfigurations could lead to manipulation.

**Breaking Down the Attack:**

The attacker's goal is to inject malicious or manipulated data into the application's logic in a way that affects how `scientist` determines which branch to execute or how the comparison logic operates. This could manifest in several ways:

* **Directly Influencing Experiment Assignment:**  `Scientist` often uses a mechanism (e.g., a feature flag, a user segment) to determine if a particular user should participate in an experiment. Untrusted input could be used to force a user into or out of an experiment group.
* **Manipulating Experiment Parameters:**  Some experiments rely on configuration parameters. An attacker could potentially alter these parameters via untrusted input, leading to skewed results or unintended behavior within the experimental code.
* **Bypassing Experiment Logic:**  By manipulating input, an attacker might be able to circumvent the `scientist` framework entirely, forcing the application to always execute a specific code path.
* **Influencing Comparison Logic:** While less direct, an attacker could potentially manipulate data that feeds into the comparison process, making the results appear skewed in favor of the attacker's desired outcome.

**Detailed Analysis of Provided Metadata:**

* **Likelihood: Medium:** This suggests that while not trivial, the attack is achievable with a reasonable amount of effort and knowledge. Common vulnerabilities like improper input validation or insecure configuration could make this path viable.
* **Impact: High:** This is the most concerning aspect. Successfully influencing experiment logic can have significant consequences:
    * **Incorrect Data and Business Decisions:**  If the experiment is designed to gather data for decision-making, a manipulated outcome can lead to flawed conclusions and poor business choices.
    * **Security Vulnerabilities Exposure:**  If the experimental code contains vulnerabilities, forcing its execution consistently could expose those vulnerabilities to exploitation.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the experimental code is resource-intensive or prone to errors, forcing its execution could lead to performance degradation or application crashes.
    * **Feature Misbehavior or Instability:**  Forcing the execution of a specific code path could lead to unexpected behavior or instability in the application's features.
    * **Circumvention of Security Controls:** Experiments might involve testing new security features. An attacker could manipulate the logic to bypass these controls.
* **Effort: Low:** This indicates that once the entry point for untrusted input is identified and a method for influencing the experiment logic is found, the actual execution of the attack is relatively straightforward.
* **Skill Level: Intermediate:**  The attacker needs a good understanding of web application architecture, input handling mechanisms, and the basic principles of A/B testing and the `scientist` library.
* **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  Detecting this type of attack can be challenging. Standard security monitoring might not flag the manipulation of experiment logic as malicious activity. It requires a deeper understanding of the application's intended behavior and the parameters of the running experiments.
* **Justification: Relatively easy to achieve and can significantly alter application behavior. The combination of medium likelihood and high impact makes this a high-risk path.** This justification accurately summarizes the core concern. The ease of execution combined with the potential for serious consequences makes this a priority for mitigation.

**Potential Attack Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Feature Flag Manipulation:** An application uses a cookie to determine if a user is part of an experiment for a new checkout flow. An attacker could manipulate their cookie value to force themselves (or other users) into the experimental group, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities within the new checkout flow.
* **Scenario 2: Parameter Injection:** An experiment involves adjusting a pricing algorithm based on user location. An attacker could manipulate the location data sent in the request to influence the pricing they receive, potentially gaining an unfair advantage.
* **Scenario 3: Bypassing Security Experiment:** An application is testing a new authentication mechanism via an experiment. An attacker could manipulate a header value to consistently bypass the experimental authentication and access the application using the older, potentially less secure, method.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before it is used to make decisions about experiment assignment or parameter configuration. This should include checking data types, formats, and ranges.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**  Ensure that experiment configurations and parameters are stored and managed securely, preventing unauthorized modification. Avoid relying on user-provided input for critical experiment settings.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Minimize the scope of influence that user input has on the application's core logic, especially concerning experiment execution.
* **Strong Type Checking:**  Where possible, enforce strong type checking on input values used in experiment logic to prevent unexpected data types from causing issues.
* **Consider Signed or Encrypted Input:** For sensitive parameters related to experiment assignment, consider using signed or encrypted values to prevent tampering.
* **Robust Experiment Design:** Design experiments with clear boundaries and avoid relying on easily manipulated input for critical decisions.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments, specifically targeting the areas where user input interacts with the `scientist` library.
* **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**  Establish monitoring mechanisms to detect unusual patterns in experiment participation or behavior. Alert on deviations from expected experiment group sizes or significant changes in experimental outcomes.
* **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to how user input is used in conjunction with the `scientist` library.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Analyze Experiment Group Distribution:** Monitor the distribution of users across different experiment groups. Significant and unexpected deviations could indicate manipulation.
* **Track Experiment Outcomes:**  Monitor the results of experiments for anomalies or unexpected patterns that might suggest manipulation.
* **Log Input Values:**  Log relevant input values that are used in experiment logic for auditing and forensic analysis.
* **Correlation with Other Security Events:** Correlate unusual experiment behavior with other security events to identify potential attacks.
* **Implement Canary Tokens:**  Place unique, identifiable values within experiment configurations. If these values are ever observed in unexpected contexts, it could indicate a compromise.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path **1.1.2: Influence Experiment Logic via Untrusted Input** represents a significant security risk due to its combination of medium likelihood and high impact. Attackers can leverage untrusted input to manipulate the core decision-making process of the `scientist` library, potentially leading to incorrect data, exposure of vulnerabilities, and other serious consequences.

The development team must prioritize implementing robust mitigation strategies, focusing on strict input validation, secure configuration management, and thorough security testing. Continuous monitoring of experiment behavior and proactive detection measures are crucial to identify and respond to potential attacks targeting this path. By addressing these vulnerabilities, the application can ensure the integrity of its experimentation framework and protect itself from potential exploitation.
