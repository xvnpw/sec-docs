## Deep Analysis: Insecurely Stored Experiment Definitions Attack Surface

This analysis delves into the "Insecurely Stored Experiment Definitions" attack surface within an application utilizing the `github/scientist` library. We will explore the technical details, potential attack vectors, and provide more granular mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Core Vulnerability:**

The fundamental issue lies in the trust placed in the experiment definitions loaded by `scientist`. The library is designed to execute code defined within these configurations without inherent security checks on the source or content. This design decision prioritizes flexibility and ease of use for A/B testing and feature rollouts. However, it inherently creates a significant security risk if the storage mechanism for these definitions is compromised.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Surface:**

1. **Storage Locations and Access Control Weaknesses:**

   * **Plain Text Configuration Files:** The example provided highlights this common vulnerability. If configuration files containing experiment definitions are stored as plain text and reside within the web server's document root or are accessible by the web server user (e.g., through shared file systems), attackers can directly modify them.
   * **Databases without Proper Access Control:**  Experiment definitions might be stored in databases. If these databases lack strong authentication, authorization, or encryption, attackers could gain access and manipulate the stored configurations. This includes SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications interacting with the database.
   * **Cloud Storage Buckets with Lax Permissions:** Applications might leverage cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to store experiment definitions. Misconfigured bucket policies allowing public read/write access or access to unauthorized users pose a significant risk.
   * **Version Control Systems (Misuse):** While version control is generally secure, storing sensitive experiment definitions directly within the main codebase repository without proper access controls (especially for internal or less secure repositories) can expose them.
   * **Environment Variables:**  While less likely for complex code snippets, storing experiment definitions (or paths to them) in environment variables can be risky if the environment is not properly secured.
   * **Configuration Management Tools (Misconfiguration):** Tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet might be used to deploy experiment configurations. Misconfigurations in these tools could lead to unintended access or modification.
   * **Internal APIs without Authentication:**  If an internal API is used to manage experiment definitions and lacks proper authentication or authorization, attackers gaining access to the internal network could manipulate these definitions.

2. **Exploiting the Trust in `scientist`:**

   * **Direct Code Injection:** The most direct attack involves injecting malicious code directly into the `control` or `candidate` branches within the experiment definition. Since `scientist` executes this code, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
   * **Manipulating Experiment Logic:** Attackers might subtly alter the logic of experiments to achieve malicious goals. This could involve:
      * **Data Exfiltration:** Modifying the candidate branch to send sensitive data to an external server.
      * **Privilege Escalation:**  If the application performs actions based on experiment outcomes, manipulating the experiment to always favor a certain branch could lead to unintended privilege escalation.
      * **Denial of Service:** Injecting code that consumes excessive resources or crashes the application.
      * **Bypassing Security Controls:**  If an experiment is designed to temporarily disable a security feature, an attacker could manipulate the experiment to keep it disabled indefinitely.

3. **Impact Amplification through `scientist`'s Execution Context:**

   * **Application's Permissions:** The malicious code injected will run with the same permissions as the application itself. This could grant access to databases, file systems, and other resources the application interacts with.
   * **Network Access:** The attacker can leverage the application's network connectivity to communicate with external systems, download further payloads, or exfiltrate data.
   * **Internal Libraries and Dependencies:** The injected code can potentially interact with other libraries and components within the application, potentially exploiting further vulnerabilities.

**Advanced Attack Scenarios:**

* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the experiment definitions are sourced from external repositories or dependencies, attackers could compromise these sources to inject malicious code that will eventually be executed by `scientist`.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious insiders with access to the storage locations can easily inject malicious code into experiment definitions.
* **Chained Exploits:**  This vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker might first gain access to the server through an unrelated vulnerability and then leverage the insecurely stored experiment definitions for code execution.

**Granular Mitigation Strategies and Development Team Considerations:**

Beyond the initial mitigation strategies, consider these more detailed approaches:

* **Secure Storage Implementation:**
    * **Dedicated Configuration Directories:** Store experiment definitions in directories with highly restricted permissions, accessible only by the application user and necessary administrative accounts.
    * **Encrypted File Systems/Volumes:** Utilize encryption at rest for the storage location of experiment definitions.
    * **Secure Key Management:** If encryption is used, implement robust key management practices to protect the decryption keys.
* **Enhanced Access Control Mechanisms:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control who can read, write, and modify experiment definitions.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes interacting with the experiment definitions.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review and audit access permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.
* **Code Security within Experiment Definitions:**
    * **Avoid Storing Executable Code Directly:**  Instead of embedding code snippets, store references (e.g., function names, class paths) to pre-existing, well-vetted code within the application. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If storing code snippets is unavoidable, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code. This is complex and should be approached with extreme caution.
    * **Code Review for Experiment Definitions:** Treat experiment definitions with the same security scrutiny as regular code. Implement code review processes for any changes to these configurations.
* **Integrity Verification:**
    * **Digital Signatures:** Sign experiment definitions to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Verify the signature before loading and executing the configuration.
    * **Hashing and Checksums:**  Store hashes or checksums of the experiment definitions and verify them before execution to detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Runtime Security Measures:**
    * **Sandboxing/Containerization:**  Run the application and the `scientist` library within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of any potential code execution.
    * **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized access or modifications to experiment definitions. Alert on suspicious activity.
* **Developer Training and Awareness:**
    * **Security Best Practices:** Educate developers on the risks associated with insecurely stored configurations and the importance of secure coding practices.
    * **Threat Modeling:** Conduct threat modeling exercises specifically focusing on the experiment definition storage and execution flow.
* **Configuration as Code (IaC) Security:** If using IaC tools, ensure the security of the IaC configurations themselves, as they might manage the experiment definitions.

**Impact Reassessment:**

While the initial assessment correctly identifies the risk severity as "Critical," it's crucial to understand the potential scope of the impact:

* **Data Breaches:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored within the application's database or file system.
* **Service Disruption:** Malicious code could crash the application, leading to downtime and impacting users.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack could severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Data breaches, service disruptions, and legal ramifications can result in significant financial losses.
* **Supply Chain Compromise (Indirect):** If the compromised application interacts with other systems, the attack could potentially spread to other parts of the organization or even to external partners.

**Conclusion:**

The "Insecurely Stored Experiment Definitions" attack surface represents a significant security vulnerability when using the `github/scientist` library. The library's design inherently trusts the provided configurations, making the security of their storage paramount. A multi-layered approach combining secure storage practices, robust access controls, code security within experiment definitions, and runtime security measures is essential to mitigate this risk. The development team must prioritize secure implementation and treat experiment definitions with the same level of security consideration as core application code. Regular security assessments and penetration testing should specifically target this attack surface to ensure the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
