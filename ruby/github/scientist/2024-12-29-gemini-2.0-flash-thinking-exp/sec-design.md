## Project Design Document: Scientist Library (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides an enhanced design overview of the Scientist library, a Ruby library facilitating safe and reliable code refactoring through controlled experimentation. The primary purpose of this document is to serve as a comprehensive resource for threat modeling activities. It details the library's architecture, data flow, and key security considerations. This document is intended for security engineers, developers, and anyone involved in assessing the security posture of applications integrating the Scientist library.

**2. Project Overview**

The Scientist library empowers developers to refactor critical code paths with increased confidence. It achieves this by enabling the parallel execution of both the original (control) code and the refactored (candidate) code. The library then compares the results to ensure functional equivalence before the refactored code is fully adopted. The fundamental concept revolves around defining an "experiment" encompassing a control block, one or more candidate blocks, a mechanism for comparing their outputs, and a way to publish the experiment's outcome.

**3. System Architecture**

The Scientist library is designed to be embedded within the application's runtime environment. It does not operate as an independent service or process.

*   **Key Components:**
    *   **"Scientist Instance":** The primary interface for defining and executing experiments. It orchestrates the execution of control and candidate blocks, manages the comparator, and invokes the publisher.
    *   **"Experiment Definition":**  A configuration object or block that specifies the control block, candidate block(s), comparator, publisher, and optional context for a particular refactoring experiment.
    *   **"Control Block":** A code block encapsulating the original, trusted implementation whose behavior is to be preserved.
    *   **"Candidate Block(s)":** One or more code blocks representing the refactored implementation(s) being tested for equivalence against the control.
    *   **"Comparator":** A function or code block responsible for determining if the results produced by the control and candidate blocks are considered equivalent. This logic is crucial for the success of the experiment.
    *   **"Publisher":** A mechanism for recording and reporting the results of an experiment. This includes information about whether the candidate matched the control, any exceptions raised during execution, and associated contextual data.
    *   **"Context (Optional)":**  Additional data that can be associated with an experiment to provide richer information for analysis and debugging. This might include user IDs, request parameters, or other relevant application state.

        subgraph "Application Runtime"
            A["User Code"] --> B("Scientist Instance");
            B -- "Define Experiment" --> C{{"Experiment Definition"}};
            C -- "Contains" --> D[["Control Block"]];
            C -- "Contains" --> E[["Candidate Block(s)"]];
            C -- "Contains" --> F[["Comparator"]];
            C -- "Contains" --> G[["Publisher"]];
            C -- "Contains" --> H[["Context (Optional)"]];
            B -- "Execute Control" --> D;
            B -- "Execute Candidate(s)" --> E;
            D -- "Control Result" --> I("Result Aggregation");
            E -- "Candidate Result(s)" --> I;
            I -- "Compare Results" --> F;
            F -- "Comparison Outcome" --> J("Experiment Result");
            J -- "Publish" --> G;
        end
    ```

**4. Data Flow (Detailed)**

The data flow within a Scientist experiment involves the following steps:

*   **Experiment Initialization:** User code interacts with a `Scientist Instance` to initiate an experiment, providing the necessary components (control, candidate(s), comparator, publisher, and optional context).
*   **Control Execution:** The `Scientist Instance` executes the "Control Block". The output of this block is captured. This output can be of any data type supported by the application.
*   **Candidate Execution:** The `Scientist Instance` then executes the "Candidate Block(s)". The output of each candidate block is also captured. Similar to the control, the output can be of any data type.
*   **Result Aggregation:** The results from the control and candidate blocks are collected and prepared for comparison.
*   **Comparison:** The captured results are passed to the "Comparator". The comparator executes its logic to determine if the candidate's result(s) are equivalent to the control's result based on the defined criteria. The comparator's output is a boolean value (or similar representation of equivalence).
*   **Result Publication:** The "Experiment Result", including the outcome of the comparison, any exceptions raised during the execution of the control or candidate blocks, the execution times, and the optional "Context", is passed to the "Publisher".
*   **Publication Action:** The "Publisher" performs its configured action, which typically involves logging the experiment results to a file, database, or an external monitoring system.
*   **Return Value:** The `Scientist Instance` typically returns the result of the "Control Block" to the calling user code. This ensures that the application's primary functionality remains consistent during the experiment.

**5. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)**

This section details potential security considerations to be addressed during threat modeling.

*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Threat:** If the "Control Block" or "Candidate Block(s)" are constructed using dynamically evaluated code or user-provided input without proper sanitization, it could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Example:**  A developer might inadvertently use `eval()` or similar constructs with unsanitized input when defining the control or candidate logic.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Threat:** The "Publisher" might inadvertently log or transmit sensitive data contained within the results of the control or candidate blocks, or within the "Context".
    *   **Example:**  Experiment results might contain personally identifiable information (PII) or API keys that are then logged to a shared location without proper access controls.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Threat:** Maliciously crafted "Candidate Block(s)" could be designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), potentially degrading the performance or causing the application to become unavailable.
    *   **Example:** A candidate block might contain an infinite loop or attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory.
*   **Timing Attacks and Side-Channel Leaks:**
    *   **Threat:**  Observable differences in the execution time of the control and candidate blocks could potentially leak information about the internal workings or security mechanisms of the application.
    *   **Example:**  If a candidate block that bypasses a security check executes significantly faster, it might reveal the presence and overhead of that check.
*   **Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Threat:** The Scientist library itself or its dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not properly managed and updated.
    *   **Example:**  An outdated version of a gem used by Scientist might have a publicly known vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Publisher Configuration:**
    *   **Threat:**  If the "Publisher" is misconfigured, it could lead to security issues such as writing experiment results to publicly accessible locations or using insecure communication protocols.
    *   **Example:**  A publisher might be configured to send experiment data over unencrypted HTTP.
*   **Tampering with Experiment Definition:**
    *   **Threat:** If an attacker can influence the definition of the experiment (e.g., by modifying the "Comparator" to always return true or by replacing the "Publisher"), they could manipulate the outcome of the refactoring process and introduce flawed code.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker might gain access to the application's configuration and alter the comparator logic.
*   **Unintended Side Effects in Candidate Blocks:**
    *   **Threat:**  Even if the "Comparator" deems the results equivalent, "Candidate Block(s)" might have unintended side effects that could alter the application's state in unexpected or harmful ways.
    *   **Example:** A candidate block might inadvertently write data to a database or trigger external API calls.

**6. Assumptions and Constraints**

*   The Scientist library operates within the security context of the application it is embedded in. It does not introduce its own security boundaries.
*   The security of the underlying Ruby runtime environment and the host operating system are prerequisites for the secure operation of the Scientist library.
*   Developers using the library are responsible for ensuring the security of the code within the "Control Block", "Candidate Block(s)", and "Comparator". The library provides the framework but does not enforce the security of these components.
*   The security of the chosen "Publisher" and its configuration is the responsibility of the developers integrating the library.
*   It is assumed that access to the application's codebase and configuration is appropriately controlled to prevent unauthorized modification of experiment definitions.

**7. Future Considerations (Security Focused)**

*   **Sandboxing of Candidate Execution:** Explore options for sandboxing or isolating the execution of "Candidate Block(s)" to mitigate the risk of unintended side effects or resource exhaustion.
*   **Secure Publisher Options:** Provide or recommend "Publisher" implementations that offer secure logging and transmission of experiment data, including encryption and authentication mechanisms.
*   **Input Validation for Experiment Definition:** Consider adding mechanisms to validate the structure and content of experiment definitions to prevent malformed or malicious configurations.
*   **Security Auditing Hooks:** Introduce hooks or events that allow security monitoring tools to observe and audit experiment execution and results.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Considerations:** If Scientist is used in a web context, consider how its execution might interact with CSP and potential bypasses.

This improved design document provides a more detailed and security-focused overview of the Scientist library. It serves as a solid foundation for conducting thorough threat modeling exercises to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities associated with its use.
