Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `scientist`, focusing on high and critical severity levels:

*   **Code Injection via Experiment Definition:**
    *   **Description:** Malicious code can be injected and executed if the experiment's `use` or `try` blocks are dynamically constructed using unsanitized input from untrusted sources.
    *   **How Scientist Contributes:** `Scientist`'s design allows for the dynamic definition of experiment blocks (`use`, `try`). If the code within these blocks is built using external data without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for code injection.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to define custom experiment names, and this name is directly incorporated into the `use` block string without sanitization: `Scientist.run(f"my_experiment_{user_input}") { ... }`. An attacker could input `"; system('rm -rf /');"` leading to command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, and other severe consequences depending on the privileges of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always treat data used to define experiment blocks (`use`, `try`) as potentially untrusted.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques.
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing code blocks based on user input. Consider using parameterized experiment definitions or a more declarative approach where code is not directly constructed from user input.

*   **Resource Exhaustion via Candidate Execution:**
    *   **Description:** A poorly written or malicious candidate code block can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.
    *   **How Scientist Contributes:** `Scientist` executes the candidate code alongside the control. If the candidate is inefficient or intentionally designed to consume resources, it can negatively impact the application's performance and availability.
    *   **Example:** A candidate block contains an infinite loop or attempts to allocate a large amount of memory. When the experiment runs, this can freeze the application or cause it to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, and potential infrastructure costs due to resource overutilization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test candidate code for resource usage before deploying experiments.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits for candidate executions.
        *   Monitor resource consumption during experiment execution.
        *   Consider using separate processes or containers for candidate execution to isolate resource usage.

*   **Information Disclosure via Experiment Results:**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data processed within the experiment can be inadvertently exposed through logging or publishing mechanisms if these are not properly secured.
    *   **How Scientist Contributes:** `Scientist` often involves logging or publishing the results of the control and candidate executions, including the returned values. If this data contains sensitive information and the logging/publishing is insecure, it creates a disclosure risk.
    *   **Example:** An experiment compares user profiles, and the entire profile objects are logged as part of the experiment results. If these logs are accessible to unauthorized individuals, sensitive user data is exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, privacy violations, and potential regulatory non-compliance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider what data is logged or published as part of experiment results.
        *   Implement secure logging practices, including access controls and encryption.
        *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from experiment results before logging or publishing.
        *   Ensure that any custom publishers used are secure and do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
