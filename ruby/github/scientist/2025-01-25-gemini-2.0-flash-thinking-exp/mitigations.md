## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Experiments Executed via Scientist](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_experiments_executed_via_scientist.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Rate Limiting Experiments Executed via Scientist

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Scientist Execution Points:** Locate all instances in your codebase where you are using `Scientist.run` or similar methods to initiate experiments.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting Around Scientist Execution:**  Introduce a rate limiting mechanism *specifically around the calls to `Scientist.run`*. This mechanism should control how frequently new experiments are initiated through the `scientist` framework.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits for Scientist:** Define appropriate rate limits for experiment initiation. Consider the overall application load and the potential impact of running many experiments concurrently through `scientist`.
    4.  **Monitor Scientist Experiment Initiation Rate:** Implement monitoring to track how often experiments are being started via `scientist` and if the rate limiting is effectively controlling this rate.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Scientist-Driven Experiment Overload (High Severity):**  Uncontrolled execution of experiments through `scientist`, especially if experiments are resource-intensive, can lead to application instability or DoS.
    *   **Performance Degradation due to Excessive Scientist Experimentation (Medium Severity):** Even well-behaved experiments, if initiated too frequently via `scientist`, can cumulatively degrade application performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Scientist-Driven Experiment Overload (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS by preventing the `scientist` framework from becoming a vector for overwhelming the system with experiments.
    *   **Performance Degradation due to Excessive Scientist Experimentation (Medium Impact):** Reduces performance degradation by ensuring that experiment initiation via `scientist` is controlled and doesn't consume excessive resources.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the user authentication service. Rate limiting is applied *specifically to `Scientist.run` calls* related to login experiments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is not applied to `Scientist.run` calls in other services like the product catalog or order processing.
    *   The rate limiting mechanism is not centrally managed for all `Scientist.run` instances across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asynchronous Execution of Scientist Experiments](./mitigation_strategies/asynchronous_execution_of_scientist_experiments.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Asynchronous Execution of Scientist Experiments

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Synchronous Scientist Usage:** Find all places where `Scientist.run` is used in a synchronous manner, directly blocking the main request flow.
    2.  **Refactor to Asynchronous Scientist Execution:** Modify the code to execute the *experiment logic initiated by `Scientist.run`* asynchronously. This means that the `Scientist.run` call itself might still be synchronous to initiate the experiment, but the actual execution of the control and candidate branches should be offloaded.
    3.  **Utilize Asynchronous Mechanisms for Scientist:** Integrate asynchronous task execution mechanisms (e.g., background job queues, thread pools) to handle the execution of experiment branches initiated by `Scientist`.
    4.  **Monitor Asynchronous Scientist Tasks:** Monitor the asynchronous tasks spawned by `Scientist.run` to ensure they are executing correctly and efficiently.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation in Main Request Path due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Severity):** Synchronous execution of experiments *managed by `scientist`* adds latency to user requests.
    *   **Increased Risk of Timeouts and Errors in User Requests due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Severity):** Long-running synchronous experiments *initiated by `scientist`* can increase request timeout probabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation in Main Request Path due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces performance impact by removing the execution of experiment branches *managed by `scientist`* from the main request path.
    *   **Increased Risk of Timeouts and Errors in User Requests due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Impact):** Reduces timeout and error risks by preventing experiments *initiated by `scientist`* from blocking request processing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the order processing service for experiments *using `scientist`* related to payment gateway integrations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Asynchronous execution is not consistently used for all `Scientist.run` calls across services. Many services still use `scientist` in a synchronous manner.
    *   The asynchronous execution pattern for `scientist` experiments is not standardized across the project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization within Scientist Experiment Code](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_within_scientist_experiment_code.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Data Sanitization within Scientist Experiment Code

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Data Handling in Scientist Experiments:**  Specifically examine the code within the control and candidate blocks of your `Scientist.run` calls to identify where sensitive data is processed.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization in Scientist Experiment Branches:**  Within the control and candidate functions passed to `Scientist.run`, implement data sanitization steps *before* any logging or reporting of experiment results.
    3.  **Utilize Sanitization Functions in Scientist Context:** Ensure that developers are using the designated data sanitization functions *within the experiment code they write for `scientist`*.
    4.  **Code Review Focus on Scientist Experiment Data Handling:** During code reviews, specifically verify that data sanitization is correctly applied within the control and candidate blocks of `Scientist.run` calls.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Scientist Experiment Logs (High Severity):** Sensitive data processed within `scientist` experiments could be inadvertently logged and exposed.
    *   **Compliance Violations due to Scientist Experiment Data Logging (High Severity):** Logging PII within `scientist` experiments without proper sanitization can lead to regulatory breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Scientist Experiment Logs (High Impact):** Significantly reduces data leakage risk by ensuring sensitive data is sanitized *within the experiment logic executed by `scientist`*.
    *   **Compliance Violations due to Scientist Experiment Data Logging (High Impact):** Reduces compliance violation risks by promoting responsible PII handling *within the context of `scientist` experiments*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Data masking is used in some experiments *defined using `scientist`* within the user profile service.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Data sanitization is not consistently applied in all experiments *implemented with `scientist`* across different services.
    *   Guidance and tooling specific to data sanitization *within `scientist` experiment code* are lacking.

    *   **Data Corruption/Inconsistency in External Systems due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Severity):** Flawed experiment logic *within `scientist`* interacting with real systems could lead to data issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Side Effects from Scientist Experiments on External Systems (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces side effect risks by isolating experiments *managed by `scientist`* from real external systems.
    *   **Performance Impact on External Systems from Scientist Experiments (Medium Impact):** Reduces performance impact by preventing experiments *initiated by `scientist`* from generating unnecessary load on external systems.
    *   **Data Corruption/Inconsistency in External Systems due to Scientist Experiments (Medium Impact):** Reduces data integrity risks by preventing experiments *run via `scientist`* from directly modifying real data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
