Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Candidate Code Authorization Bypass" threat, tailored for a development team using GitHub Scientist, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Candidate Code Authorization Bypass in GitHub Scientist

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Candidate Code Authorization Bypass" threat within the context of using GitHub Scientist, identify its root causes, assess its potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge and tools necessary to prevent this vulnerability from being introduced or exploited in our application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the interaction between our application's authorization logic and the use of GitHub Scientist.  It encompasses:

*   **Control Path Authorization:**  The existing, established authorization mechanisms in the application's primary code path.
*   **Candidate Path Authorization:** The authorization logic (or lack thereof) within the code executed by Scientist's `try` block.
*   **Scientist's Execution Model:** How Scientist executes the candidate code, handles exceptions, and publishes results.
*   **Side Effects:**  Any actions performed by the candidate code that have persistent effects, regardless of whether the result is used.  This includes database writes, external API calls, message queue publications, etc.
*   **Exception Handling:**  The behavior of both the control and candidate paths, and Scientist itself, when exceptions (especially authorization-related exceptions) occur.
* **Scientist Configuration:** How the Scientist library is configured and used within the application.

This analysis *excludes* general authorization best practices that are not directly related to the use of Scientist.  It also excludes threats unrelated to the execution of candidate code.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Thorough examination of the application code, focusing on areas where Scientist is used and where authorization checks are performed.  This includes both the control and candidate code paths.
2.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-evaluation of the existing threat model, specifically focusing on the "Candidate Code Authorization Bypass" threat.
3.  **Scientist Library Analysis:**  Review of the GitHub Scientist library's documentation and source code to understand its execution model, exception handling, and configuration options.
4.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Construction of specific scenarios where this vulnerability could be exploited, including edge cases and unexpected inputs.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assessment of the proposed mitigation strategies (Identical Authorization, Centralized Authorization, Sandboxing, Careful Exception Handling) in terms of feasibility, effectiveness, and potential impact on performance.
6.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Formulation of concrete, actionable recommendations for the development team, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and testing strategies.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Candidate Code Authorization Bypass

This threat leverages the core functionality of GitHub Scientist: the ability to run "candidate" code alongside "control" code.  The danger lies in the potential for the candidate code to have weaker or entirely absent authorization checks, leading to unauthorized actions.

**4.1 Root Causes:**

*   **Divergent Authorization Logic:** The most common root cause is simply having different authorization logic in the control and candidate paths.  This can happen due to:
    *   **Oversight:** Developers may forget to apply the same authorization checks to the candidate code.
    *   **Refactoring Errors:**  Authorization logic may be refactored in the control path but not updated in the candidate path.
    *   **Intentional Differences (Misguided):**  Developers might *intentionally* use weaker authorization in the candidate path, perhaps under the mistaken belief that the results are discarded, and therefore the side effects are harmless.
*   **Implicit Trust in Scientist:** Developers might assume that Scientist provides some level of protection or sandboxing, which it does *not*. Scientist is a *comparison* tool, not a security tool.
*   **Inadequate Exception Handling:**  Even if authorization checks *are* present in the candidate code, poorly designed exception handling can bypass them.  For example, a generic `rescue` block that catches *all* exceptions might inadvertently suppress an `AuthorizationError`, allowing the unauthorized action to proceed.
* **Lack of Centralized Authorization:** If authorization logic is duplicated across multiple parts of the codebase, it becomes much harder to ensure consistency and avoid discrepancies.
* **Scientist Misconfiguration:** While less likely to be the *root* cause, misconfiguring Scientist (e.g., not properly handling exceptions or publishing sensitive data) can exacerbate the problem.

**4.2 Detailed Scenario Analysis:**

Let's consider a concrete example: updating a user's profile.

*   **Control Path:**
    ```ruby
    def update_profile(user_id, params)
      user = User.find(user_id)
      authorize! :update, user  # Authorization check
      user.update(params)
    end
    ```
*   **Candidate Path (Vulnerable):**
    ```ruby
    def update_profile_new(user_id, params)
      user = User.find(user_id)
      # Missing authorization check!
      user.update(params)
    end
    ```
*   **Scientist Experiment:**
    ```ruby
    Scientist::Experiment.new(:profile_update) do |e|
      e.use { update_profile(user_id, params) } # Control
      e.try { update_profile_new(user_id, params) } # Candidate
    end.run
    ```

In this scenario, an attacker who *doesn't* have permission to update a specific user's profile could still trigger the `update_profile_new` function through Scientist.  Even though the *return value* of `update_profile_new` is discarded, the `user.update(params)` call *will* modify the database, resulting in an unauthorized profile update.

**Another scenario, with exception handling issue:**

*   **Candidate Path (Vulnerable):**
    ```ruby
    def update_profile_new(user_id, params)
      user = User.find(user_id)
      authorize! :update, user  # Authorization check
      user.update(params)
    rescue => e #Catches ALL exceptions
        Rails.logger.error("Failed to update profile: #{e.message}")
    end
    ```
    Here, even though the authorization check is present, the broad `rescue` block will catch the `AuthorizationError` raised by `authorize!`. The update will not happen, but the exception is swallowed, and the calling code (Scientist) will not be aware of the authorization failure. This is still a problem, as it masks the authorization issue. A better approach would be:

    ```ruby
    def update_profile_new(user_id, params)
      user = User.find(user_id)
      authorize! :update, user  # Authorization check
      user.update(params)
    rescue NotAuthorizedError => e # Only catch authorization errors
        raise e # Re-raise the authorization error
    rescue => e
        Rails.logger.error("Failed to update profile: #{e.message}")
    end
    ```

**4.3 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of this vulnerability is severe, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise:

*   **Data Modification:**  Unauthorized users could modify sensitive data, as demonstrated in the profile update example.
*   **Data Disclosure:**  Candidate code might expose sensitive data through logging, external API calls, or other side effects.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the candidate code interacts with privileged operations (e.g., creating admin users), an attacker could gain elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Candidate code with weaker authorization might be more susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to significant reputational damage.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**

Let's examine the proposed mitigation strategies in more detail:

*   **Identical Authorization:** This is the most straightforward and recommended approach.  The candidate code *must* perform the same authorization checks as the control code, using the same mechanisms.  This ensures that any authorization bypass in the control path would also be present in the candidate path, making it detectable during the experiment.
    *   **Implementation:**  Call the *same* authorization methods (e.g., `authorize!`) in both the control and candidate paths.  Avoid duplicating authorization logic.
    *   **Testing:**  Write tests that specifically target the authorization checks in *both* paths.

*   **Centralized Authorization:** This is a broader architectural best practice that significantly reduces the risk of authorization bypasses.  By using a centralized authorization framework (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan), you ensure that authorization logic is defined in a single, consistent location.
    *   **Implementation:**  Adopt a centralized authorization framework and refactor existing code to use it.
    *   **Testing:**  Write comprehensive tests for the authorization framework itself.

*   **Sandboxing (Ideal but Difficult):**  True sandboxing (e.g., running the candidate code in a separate process or container with restricted permissions) would provide the strongest protection.  However, this is often complex to implement and can have significant performance overhead.
    *   **Implementation:**  Explore options like Docker containers or serverless functions.  Carefully consider the performance implications.
    *   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the sandboxing mechanism to ensure it effectively isolates the candidate code.

*   **Careful Exception Handling:**  As demonstrated in the scenario analysis, exception handling is crucial.  Avoid generic `rescue` blocks that catch all exceptions.  Specifically handle authorization exceptions and re-raise them to ensure that Scientist is aware of the authorization failure.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use specific exception classes (e.g., `NotAuthorizedError`) and only catch those exceptions that you intend to handle.  Re-raise authorization exceptions.
    *   **Testing:**  Write tests that specifically trigger authorization exceptions and verify that they are correctly handled.

## 5. Recommendations

Based on this deep analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1.  **Immediate Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of all areas where Scientist is used, focusing on the authorization logic in both the control and candidate paths.
2.  **Implement Identical Authorization:**  Ensure that the candidate code performs the *exact same* authorization checks as the control code, using the same methods and logic.
3.  **Prioritize Centralized Authorization:**  Begin planning and implementing a centralized authorization framework (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan) to improve the overall security and maintainability of the application.
4.  **Refactor Exception Handling:**  Review and refactor exception handling around Scientist experiments, ensuring that authorization exceptions are specifically handled and re-raised.
5.  **Enhance Testing:**  Add new tests that specifically target the authorization checks in both the control and candidate paths, including scenarios that trigger authorization exceptions.
6.  **Scientist Configuration Review:**  Review the configuration of GitHub Scientist to ensure it's not inadvertently exposing sensitive data or masking authorization failures. Specifically, ensure that any custom publishers or result handling logic doesn't bypass security considerations.
7.  **Training:**  Provide training to the development team on the proper use of GitHub Scientist and the importance of authorization in candidate code.
8. **Regular Audits:** Include Scientist usage in regular security audits to ensure ongoing compliance with authorization best practices.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of "Candidate Code Authorization Bypass" and ensure that GitHub Scientist is used safely and effectively.
