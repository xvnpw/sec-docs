# Deep Analysis: Injection Attacks in Scientist's Custom Comparators/Publishers

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for injection attacks within custom comparators and publishers used with the `github/scientist` library.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, understand their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already provided.  This analysis will inform secure development practices and guide code reviews.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface introduced by the *customizability* of comparators and publishers within the `github/scientist` library.  It does *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the core `scientist` library itself (assuming the library is kept up-to-date).
*   General application security vulnerabilities unrelated to `scientist`.
*   Attacks targeting the underlying infrastructure (e.g., network attacks, OS vulnerabilities).

The scope is limited to code introduced by developers *using* `scientist` to define custom logic for comparing experimental results and publishing those results.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review Simulation:**  We will analyze hypothetical (but realistic) examples of custom comparator and publisher implementations, looking for common injection vulnerabilities.
2.  **Vulnerability Pattern Identification:** We will identify specific injection patterns that could be exploited, drawing from established vulnerability categories (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
3.  **Impact Assessment:** For each identified vulnerability, we will assess the potential impact on the application, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** We will refine the existing high-level mitigation strategies into specific, actionable recommendations.
5.  **Documentation:**  The findings will be documented in this report, providing clear guidance for developers and security reviewers.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Understanding the Threat

The `github/scientist` library allows developers to define custom logic for two key aspects of experimentation:

*   **Comparators:**  These functions determine whether the results of the "control" (existing code) and "candidate" (new code) are considered equivalent.  They typically receive the results of both code paths as input.
*   **Publishers:** These functions handle the reporting of experiment results.  They might send data to a logging system, a database, a monitoring service, or other external systems.

The core threat is that an attacker might be able to influence the input to these custom functions in a way that leads to unintended behavior.  This is the essence of an injection attack.  The attacker doesn't directly control the `scientist` library, but they might control data that *flows through* the custom comparator or publisher.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Examples and Analysis

Let's examine some specific, realistic vulnerability scenarios:

**Scenario 1: SQL Injection in a Custom Publisher**

```ruby
# Hypothetical custom publisher that logs results to a database
class MyDatabasePublisher
  def publish(result)
    control_value = result.control.value
    candidate_value = result.candidates.first.value # Assuming only one candidate
    experiment_name = result.experiment.name

    # VULNERABLE CODE: Direct string interpolation into SQL query
    query = "INSERT INTO experiment_results (experiment_name, control_value, candidate_value) VALUES ('#{experiment_name}', '#{control_value}', '#{candidate_value}')"

    execute_sql(query)
  end

  def execute_sql(query)
    # ... (Implementation to execute the SQL query) ...
  end
end

Scientist::Publisher.register(MyDatabasePublisher)
```

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.  If `control_value` or `candidate_value` contains malicious SQL fragments (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE experiment_results; --`), the database will execute those fragments.
*   **Impact:**  Data loss (table deletion), data modification, data exfiltration, potentially even server compromise depending on database permissions.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) instead of string interpolation.  This is the *primary* defense against SQL injection.  Example:
        ```ruby
        query = "INSERT INTO experiment_results (experiment_name, control_value, candidate_value) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
        execute_sql(query, experiment_name, control_value, candidate_value)
        ```
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate that `control_value` and `candidate_value` conform to expected data types and formats *before* they reach the database query.  This is a secondary defense.

**Scenario 2: Command Injection in a Custom Publisher**

```ruby
# Hypothetical custom publisher that uses a shell command to process results
class MyShellPublisher
  def publish(result)
    control_output = result.control.value.to_s
    # VULNERABLE CODE:  Unsafe use of backticks with user-supplied input
    processed_output = `process_data.sh "#{control_output}"`
    # ... (Further processing of processed_output) ...
  end
end

Scientist::Publisher.register(MyShellPublisher)
```

*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection. If `control_output` contains shell metacharacters (e.g., `&`, `|`, `;`), an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands.  For example, if `control_output` is `"; rm -rf /; #`, the server could be severely damaged.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data loss, denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  If possible, avoid using shell commands entirely.  Find a Ruby library that provides the same functionality.
    *   **Use `Open3.capture3` or Similar:** If a shell command is unavoidable, use a safer method like `Open3.capture3` to execute the command and handle input/output securely.  This allows you to pass arguments as separate parameters, preventing shell interpretation. Example:
        ```ruby
        require 'open3'
        stdout, stderr, status = Open3.capture3("process_data.sh", control_output)
        ```
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Implement extremely strict input validation to ensure that `control_output` contains *only* the expected characters and format.  This is difficult to get right and should be considered a last resort.

**Scenario 3:  String Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) in a Custom Comparator**

```ruby
# Hypothetical custom comparator that concatenates strings for comparison
class MyStringComparator
  def call(control, candidate)
    control_string = control.value.to_s
    candidate_string = candidate.value.to_s

    # VULNERABLE CODE: Direct concatenation without sanitization
    combined_string = "#{control_string} - #{candidate_string}"

    # ... (Further processing or display of combined_string) ...
     return combined_string == "expected_combined_string" #simplified example
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  String Injection, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if `combined_string` is later displayed in a web page without proper escaping.  If `control_string` or `candidate_string` contains HTML or JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), that code could be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Theft of user cookies, session hijacking, defacement of the website, phishing attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Output Encoding:**  If `combined_string` is displayed in a web page, use proper output encoding (HTML escaping) to prevent the browser from interpreting it as code.  Rails, for example, provides helpers like `h()` or `html_escape()`.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize `control_string` and `candidate_string` to remove or encode any potentially dangerous characters *before* concatenation.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.  Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library.
    * **Context-aware comparison:** If the values are supposed to be strings, compare them as strings. If they are numbers, parse them as numbers before comparison. Avoid generic string concatenation for comparison.

**Scenario 4: Log Injection in a Custom Publisher**

```ruby
class MyLogPublisher
  def publish(result)
    Rails.logger.info "Experiment #{result.experiment.name}: Control: #{result.control.value}, Candidate: #{result.candidates.first.value}"
  end
end
```

* **Vulnerability:** Log Injection. If `result.control.value` or `result.candidates.first.value` contains newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) or other special characters used by the logging system, an attacker could inject fake log entries or disrupt the log format.
* **Impact:** Difficulty in auditing, potential for misleading investigations, denial of service if the log files become excessively large.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Sanitize Log Inputs:** Sanitize the values before logging them. Remove or escape newline characters and any other characters that could interfere with the logging format.
    * **Use Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) where each field is clearly defined. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the log stream.

### 4.3. General Mitigation Strategies (Refined)

Based on the above analysis, we can refine the initial mitigation strategies:

1.  **Code Review:**
    *   **Focus:**  Pay *specific* attention to how custom comparators and publishers handle input data.  Look for any form of string concatenation, shell command execution, database interaction, or interaction with external systems.
    *   **Checklists:**  Create checklists based on the vulnerability examples above (SQL injection, command injection, XSS, log injection).
    *   **Automated Analysis:**  Consider using static analysis tools that can detect some of these vulnerabilities automatically.

2.  **Input Validation/Sanitization:**
    *   **Type Validation:**  Enforce strict type checking.  If a value is expected to be an integer, ensure it *is* an integer before using it.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Whenever possible, use whitelist validation (allow only known-good characters/patterns) rather than blacklist validation (block known-bad characters/patterns).
    *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  Use sanitization libraries appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML sanitization for HTML output, SQL escaping for database queries).
    * **Early Validation:** Validate input as early as possible in the data flow, ideally before it even enters the custom comparator or publisher.

3.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the code running the experiments (and the custom comparators/publishers) has only the minimum necessary permissions.  Don't run experiments as a root user or with excessive database privileges.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Always):**  Use parameterized queries for *all* database interactions, without exception.
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands (Prefer Libraries):**  Avoid shell commands whenever possible.  Use built-in Ruby libraries or well-vetted gems instead.
    *   **Output Encoding (Always):**  Always use appropriate output encoding when displaying data in a web page or other user interface.
    * **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging to prevent log injection.
    * **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies, including `scientist` itself, up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

## 5. Conclusion

Custom comparators and publishers in `github/scientist` introduce a significant attack surface due to the potential for injection vulnerabilities.  By understanding the specific types of injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, XSS, log injection) and implementing robust mitigation strategies (code review, input validation/sanitization, secure coding practices), developers can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities being exploited.  This analysis provides a framework for secure development and code review when using `scientist`, helping to ensure that experiments are conducted safely and reliably.
