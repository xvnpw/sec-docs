# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Candidate Code in Scientist

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability introduced by the `github/scientist` library's candidate code path, identify specific attack vectors, and propose robust mitigation strategies to prevent exploitation.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers using Scientist to ensure application availability and resilience.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the DoS vulnerability arising from the *performance difference* between the control and candidate code paths within a Scientist experiment.  It does *not* cover other potential vulnerabilities within the application itself, nor does it address vulnerabilities within the Scientist library's internal implementation (though those should be considered separately).  The scope includes:

*   **Attack Vector Identification:**  Pinpointing how an attacker can exploit the performance disparity.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  Quantifying the potential damage caused by a successful DoS attack.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Providing detailed, practical steps to prevent or mitigate the attack.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Recommending specific metrics and thresholds for detecting and responding to potential attacks.
* **Scientist Configuration:** Review configuration of Scientist.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling:**  Systematically identifying potential threats and attack vectors.  We'll use a "what could go wrong" approach, considering various attacker motivations and capabilities.
*   **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we don't have specific application code, we'll conceptually review how Scientist is typically used and identify potential weak points.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Leveraging established security best practices for DoS prevention and performance optimization.
*   **Failure Mode Analysis:**  Considering how different components (application code, Scientist library, infrastructure) could fail under stress.
* **OWASP methodology:** Using OWASP methodology for identification of vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Attack Vector Details

The core attack vector relies on the attacker's ability to craft malicious input that triggers significantly different execution times between the control and candidate code paths.  This difference is amplified by Scientist's parallel execution model.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Input Crafting:** The attacker identifies an input that causes the *candidate* code to perform poorly.  This could involve:
    *   **Algorithmic Complexity Attacks:**  Exploiting algorithms with poor worst-case performance (e.g., regular expressions with catastrophic backtracking, inefficient sorting algorithms on large datasets).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Triggering operations that consume excessive memory, CPU, or database connections in the candidate path.  This might involve large data uploads, complex calculations, or inefficient database queries.
    *   **External Service Calls:**  If the candidate code interacts with external services (APIs, databases), the attacker might target those services to induce delays or failures that only affect the candidate path.
    *   **Logic Bugs:** Exploiting logic errors in the candidate code that lead to infinite loops or excessive recursion.

2.  **Parallel Execution Exploitation:** Scientist runs both code paths concurrently.  The slow candidate code doesn't block the control code from *completing*, but it *does* consume shared resources (CPU, memory, thread pool).  This is the key to the DoS.

3.  **Resource Contention:**  The attacker repeatedly sends malicious input, causing the candidate code to consume a disproportionate amount of resources.  This starves the control code (and other parts of the application) of necessary resources.

4.  **Denial of Service:**  The application becomes slow or unresponsive, unable to handle legitimate requests.  This can lead to complete unavailability.

### 4.2. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful DoS attack via this vector can be severe:

*   **Application Unavailability:**  The primary impact is the inability of users to access the application.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Outages erode user trust and can damage the application's reputation.
*   **Financial Loss:**  For businesses, downtime can translate directly to lost revenue.
*   **Data Loss (Indirect):**  While the attack itself doesn't directly cause data loss, prolonged outages can increase the risk of data loss due to system instability or crashes.
*   **Resource Costs:**  Even if the application remains partially available, the attacker-induced resource consumption can lead to increased infrastructure costs.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The mitigation strategies outlined in the original attack surface description are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1.  **Resource Limits & Timeouts (Crucial):**

    *   **`cgroups` (Linux):**  Use `cgroups` to limit the CPU and memory resources available to the process running the Scientist experiment.  This provides a hard limit at the operating system level.
    *   **Timeouts (Within Scientist):**  Scientist *should* allow setting a timeout *specifically* for the candidate code path.  If the candidate code exceeds this timeout, it should be terminated, and the result discarded.  This timeout should be significantly shorter than the overall request timeout.  **This is a critical mitigation.**
        ```ruby
        # Example (Conceptual - Scientist doesn't have this natively,
        # so you'd need to wrap it)
        result = Scientist.science "my-experiment", candidate_timeout: 0.1 do |experiment| # 100ms timeout
          experiment.use { control_code }
          experiment.try { candidate_code }
        end
        ```
    *   **Thread Pool Management:**  If the candidate code runs in a separate thread, ensure the thread pool is configured to prevent excessive thread creation.  Consider using a bounded thread pool.

2.  **Performance Monitoring & Alerting (Essential):**

    *   **Metrics:** Track the following metrics *separately* for the control and candidate paths:
        *   **Execution Time:**  Average, 95th percentile, and maximum execution time.
        *   **Resource Consumption:**  CPU usage, memory usage, database connection usage.
        *   **Error Rate:**  Number of errors encountered.
    *   **Alerting:** Set up alerts based on:
        *   **Significant Discrepancies:**  Alert if the candidate path's execution time or resource consumption is significantly higher than the control path (e.g., a 5x difference).
        *   **Absolute Thresholds:**  Alert if the candidate path exceeds predefined resource limits (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).
        *   **Error Rate Spikes:**  Alert if the candidate path's error rate increases suddenly.
    *   **Tools:** Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, etc., to collect and visualize these metrics.

3.  **Circuit Breakers (Highly Recommended):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Implement a circuit breaker pattern *around the Scientist experiment*.  This pattern monitors the candidate path's performance and automatically disables the experiment if it consistently fails or exceeds resource thresholds.
    *   **States:**  The circuit breaker should have three states:
        *   **Closed:**  Experiment is running normally.
        *   **Open:**  Experiment is disabled (only the control path is executed).
        *   **Half-Open:**  Periodically allow a small number of requests to execute the candidate path to test if it has recovered.
    *   **Thresholds:**  Configure the circuit breaker with appropriate thresholds for failure rate, execution time, and resource consumption.

4.  **Load Testing (Proactive):**

    *   **Targeted Load Tests:**  Create load tests that specifically target the Scientist experiment with inputs designed to stress the candidate code.
    *   **Varying Input:**  Test with a variety of inputs, including those expected to be handled efficiently and those expected to be challenging.
    *   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Closely monitor resource usage during load tests to identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities.

5.  **Rate Limiting (Defense in Depth):**

    *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the application level to prevent attackers from sending an excessive number of requests.
    *   **Experiment-Specific Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing rate limiting *specifically* for requests that trigger the Scientist experiment.  This can be a lower limit than the overall application rate limit.

6.  **Code Review and Optimization (Preventative):**

    *   **Candidate Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the candidate code for performance bottlenecks and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Algorithmic Analysis:**  Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms used in the candidate code.
    *   **Database Query Optimization:**  Ensure database queries in the candidate code are optimized for performance.
    *   **Profiling:**  Use profiling tools to identify performance hotspots in the candidate code.

7. **Scientist Configuration Review:**
    * **Enabled by Default:** Review if Scientist experiments are enabled by default. Consider disabling them by default and enabling them only for specific requests or users.
    * **Sampling:** Use sampling to run experiments only on a subset of requests. This reduces the overall impact of a slow candidate path.
    * **Error Handling:** Ensure that errors in the candidate path are handled gracefully and do not affect the control path.
    * **Context:** Review context that is passed to Scientist. Ensure that no sensitive data is passed.

### 4.4. Example Scenario (Illustrative)

Let's say you're using Scientist to test a new search algorithm (candidate) against your existing search algorithm (control).

*   **Control:**  Uses a well-indexed database query.  Fast and efficient.
*   **Candidate:**  Uses a new, experimental algorithm that involves a complex regular expression match against a large text field.

An attacker could craft a search query containing a specially designed regular expression that causes catastrophic backtracking in the candidate code.  This would consume significant CPU resources, slowing down the entire application, even though the control code would handle the query quickly.  Repeated requests with this malicious query could lead to a denial of service.

By implementing the mitigation strategies above (especially timeouts and circuit breakers), you could prevent this attack from succeeding.  The timeout would kill the slow candidate execution, and the circuit breaker would disable the experiment entirely if the candidate consistently caused problems.

## 5. Conclusion
