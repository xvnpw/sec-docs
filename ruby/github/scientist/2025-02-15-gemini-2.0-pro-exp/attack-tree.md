## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Control/Candidate Mismatch](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_controlcandidate_mismatch.md)

Description: This attack vector focuses on exploiting the core functionality of Scientist: comparing the results of control (original) and candidate (new) code. The attacker aims to create or leverage discrepancies between these paths to achieve their goal.
High-Risk Path: This entire branch is considered high-risk because it directly targets the intended use of Scientist.
Critical Node: [***Manipulate Context***]
Description: The attacker modifies, corrupts, or omits data passed as context to the `Scientist.science` block. This is a critical vulnerability because the context often directly influences the behavior of both the control and candidate code.
Likelihood: Medium to High.
Impact: High to Very High.
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Medium.
Sub-Attack Vectors:
[Modify Context]: Changing existing values within the context to alter the behavior of the code.
Likelihood: High
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium
[Corrupt Context]: Introducing invalid or unexpected data into the context, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: Medium to High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium
[Omit Context]: Removing necessary data from the context, leading to incomplete or incorrect execution.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: Medium to High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit 'Run' Block Errors/Timing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_'run'_block_errorstiming.md)

Description: This attack vector targets errors or timing differences within the `Scientist.science` block, particularly in the candidate code.
High-Risk Path: The path leading to data leakage via errors is considered high-risk.
Critical Node: [***Leak Data via Error***]
Description: The attacker crafts input or conditions that cause the candidate code to throw an exception.  Critically, this exception includes sensitive data in the error message, which might then be logged or exposed.
Likelihood: Medium.
Impact: Medium to High.
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Intermediate.
Detection Difficulty: Medium.
Sub-Attack Vector:
[***Log Sensitive Data***]
Description: This is the most direct way to leak data via an error. The candidate code is manipulated to explicitly log sensitive information when a specific error condition (triggered by the attacker) occurs.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium
