# Attack Surface Analysis for github/scientist

## Attack Surface: [1. Unintended Side Effects in Candidate Code](./attack_surfaces/1__unintended_side_effects_in_candidate_code.md)

*   **Description:** The candidate (new) code path, even if intended for observation, contains a vulnerability that causes unintended state changes or external interactions.
*   **Scientist Contribution:** Scientist *executes* the candidate code path alongside the control path, making any vulnerability in the candidate code directly exploitable in a production environment. This is the fundamental and most critical risk of using Scientist.
*   **Example:** A candidate code path intended to read user data has a SQL injection vulnerability. Scientist executes this vulnerable code, allowing an attacker to modify or delete data.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, unauthorized access, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:** Perform extremely thorough code reviews of *all* candidate code, focusing on security vulnerabilities. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding in the candidate code, *even if it's believed to be read-only*.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If possible, execute the candidate code in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges. Consider database transactions that are *always* rolled back.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the candidate code runs with the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Candidate Code](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_candidate_code.md)

*   **Description:** The candidate code path is significantly slower or more resource-intensive than the control path, leading to performance degradation or resource exhaustion.
*   **Scientist Contribution:** Scientist's parallel execution of both code paths means that a slow or resource-hungry candidate code path directly impacts the overall application performance. An attacker could intentionally trigger this.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts input that triggers a computationally expensive operation (e.g., a complex regular expression or a large database query) in the *candidate* code, while the control code handles it efficiently.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unavailability, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits & Timeouts:** Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory) and timeouts *specifically* for the candidate code execution within the Scientist experiment.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Closely monitor the performance of both paths. Set up alerts for significant discrepancies.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers to automatically disable experiments that consistently exceed resource thresholds.
    *   **Load Testing:** Perform load testing that specifically targets the Scientist experiment.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limiting to prevent attackers from overwhelming the system.

## Attack Surface: [3. Sensitive Data Leakage in Mismatches](./attack_surfaces/3__sensitive_data_leakage_in_mismatches.md)

*   **Description:** Differences between the control and candidate code results, which are logged or published by Scientist, contain sensitive information.
*   **Scientist Contribution:** Scientist's core function is to compare results and report mismatches. This reporting *is* the potential leak.
*   **Example:** A mismatch log contains the full, unredacted results from both code paths, including PII or partially hashed passwords.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), credentials, or other sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Custom Comparison Function:** Implement a custom comparison function that *sanitizes* or *redacts* sensitive information *before* logging/publishing. Never log raw results.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Compare only the *essential* parts of the results.
    *   **Review Publisher Configuration:** Ensure the publisher handles sensitive data appropriately (encryption, access controls).
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Consider DLP tools to monitor and prevent leakage.

## Attack Surface: [4. Data Exfiltration via Publisher](./attack_surfaces/4__data_exfiltration_via_publisher.md)

*   **Description:** The configured publisher for Scientist results is compromised or misconfigured, allowing an attacker to access the comparison data.
*   **Scientist Contribution:** Scientist *relies* on the publisher to report results. The publisher's security is paramount.
*   **Example:** Scientist publishes to an unauthenticated, publicly accessible endpoint, or a logging service with weak access controls.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of comparison data (potentially including sensitive information) to unauthorized parties.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for publishing.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the publisher.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the publisher's security regularly.
    *   **Encryption:** Consider encrypting the published data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the publisher only minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [5. Injection Attacks in Custom Comparators/Publishers](./attack_surfaces/5__injection_attacks_in_custom_comparatorspublishers.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom comparators or publishers allow for injection attacks.
*   **Scientist Contribution:** Scientist *allows* for custom comparators and publishers, which become part of the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A custom comparator concatenates strings from results without sanitization, leading to string injection.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data corruption, denial of service (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review and test custom comparators/publishers for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation/Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation/sanitization.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices.
