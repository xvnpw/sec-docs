# Attack Surface Analysis for github/scientist

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Malicious Control/Candidate Functions](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_malicious_controlcandidate_functions.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Code Injection via Malicious Control/Candidate Functions
    * **Description:**  The application executes arbitrary code provided as either the control or candidate function within a `Scientist` experiment.
    * **How Scientist Contributes:** `Scientist.run` accepts callable objects (functions, lambdas, etc.) as arguments for the control and candidate. If the source of these callables is untrusted or dynamically generated based on untrusted input, it allows for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to define custom logic for A/B testing. A malicious user crafts a payload that, when passed as a candidate function, executes system commands to compromise the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Full control of the application's execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly control the source of control and candidate functions: Only use functions defined within the application's codebase or from trusted, well-vetted libraries.
        * Avoid dynamic generation of function code: Do not construct control or candidate functions based on user input or external data.
        * Implement robust input validation: If dynamic function generation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all input used in the process. Consider using sandboxing techniques if feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Observation Publishing](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_observation_publishing.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Data Exfiltration via Observation Publishing
    * **Description:** Sensitive data processed within the control or candidate functions is unintentionally or maliciously leaked through the `Scientist`'s observation publishing mechanism.
    * **How Scientist Contributes:** The `publish` method allows sending the results of the experiment (including the return values of the control and candidate) to external systems or logging. If the publishing logic or destination is not secured, it can be exploited for data exfiltration.
    * **Example:** The `publish` method is configured to send experiment data to a logging service. A vulnerability in the logging service or misconfiguration allows an attacker to access the logs containing sensitive user data returned by the control function.
    * **Impact:** High - Disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to privacy violations, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the publishing destination: Ensure the systems receiving published observations are secure and access is restricted. Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH) for transmission.
        * Sanitize observation data: Before publishing, carefully review and sanitize the data being sent to remove any sensitive or unnecessary information.
        * Implement access controls for publishing configuration: Restrict who can configure the `publish` method and its destination.
        * Consider alternative publishing strategies: If the default publishing mechanism is too risky, implement a custom publisher with stricter security controls.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in Experiments](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_in_experiments.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in Experiments
    * **Description:**  Maliciously crafted or resource-intensive control or candidate functions are executed repeatedly, leading to resource exhaustion and application unavailability.
    * **How Scientist Contributes:** `Scientist` facilitates the execution of both control and candidate functions. If these functions are computationally expensive or consume significant resources, repeated execution can overwhelm the application.
    * **Example:** An attacker triggers numerous experiments with a candidate function that performs an infinite loop or consumes excessive memory, causing the application server to crash.
    * **Impact:** High - Application downtime, impacting users and potentially leading to financial losses or service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts for experiment execution: Set reasonable time limits for the execution of control and candidate functions to prevent runaway processes.
        * Resource limits for experiments: If possible, implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for the execution environment of experiments.
        * Rate limiting for experiment initiation: Restrict the frequency with which experiments can be initiated, especially from untrusted sources.
        * Monitor resource usage: Track the resource consumption of experiments and alert on unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Experiment Context](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_experiment_context.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Manipulation of Experiment Context
    * **Description:**  Untrusted or malicious data provided through the `with_context` method is used to influence the behavior of the control or candidate functions in unintended and potentially harmful ways.
    * **How Scientist Contributes:** The `with_context` method allows passing arbitrary data to the experiment, which can then be accessed by the control and candidate functions. If this context data is sourced from untrusted input without proper validation, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An application uses user-provided data in the `with_context` to determine which database to query in the control and candidate functions. A malicious user manipulates this data to access a different, more sensitive database.
    * **Impact:** High - Depending on the influence of the context data, this could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Treat context data as untrusted: Always validate and sanitize any data passed through the `with_context` method before using it in control or candidate functions.
        * Minimize the use of external input in context: Avoid relying on user-provided or external data for critical decisions within the experiment.
        * Implement strong authorization checks: Ensure that the control and candidate functions enforce proper authorization based on the context data, preventing unauthorized actions.
