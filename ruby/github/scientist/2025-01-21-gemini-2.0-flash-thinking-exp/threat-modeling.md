# Threat Model Analysis for github/scientist

## Threat: [Exploiting Data Leaks in Experiment Logging/Publishing](./threats/exploiting_data_leaks_in_experiment_loggingpublishing.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Data Leaks in Experiment Logging/Publishing
    *   **Description:** The `publish` block in a Scientist experiment might inadvertently log or transmit sensitive information collected during the experiment. An attacker gaining access to these logs or transmission channels could expose this data. This could happen if the `publish` block is not carefully designed to sanitize or filter sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive user data, internal application details, or business logic, leading to privacy violations, security breaches, or competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Scientist Component:** `Experiment.publish` block.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and sanitize any data logged or transmitted in the `publish` block.
        *   Avoid logging personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary and with proper safeguards.
        *   Secure the storage and transmission channels for experiment logs and results.
        *   Implement access controls for experiment logs.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Dynamically Defined Experiments (If Applicable)](./threats/code_injection_via_dynamically_defined_experiments__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Dynamically Defined Experiments (If Applicable)
    *   **Description:** If the application allows for dynamically defining or loading experiment logic (including the `control`, `experiment`, or `compare` blocks) and this interacts directly with Scientist's execution, an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed within the application's context. This is a higher risk if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these dynamic definitions before passing them to Scientist.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application, and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Scientist Component:**  Potentially the `Science.run` method if it's used with dynamically loaded code, or the application's mechanisms for defining experiments that are then used by Scientist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic loading or execution of code from untrusted sources for experiment definitions that are used by Scientist.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided input used in experiment definitions that are passed to Scientist.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for executing dynamically defined experiments (if absolutely necessary and involving Scientist).
