## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using Scientist](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_using_scientist.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent nodes and paths aim to achieve this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Experiment Execution](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__manipulate_experiment_execution.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks focused on controlling how Scientist executes experiments. Success here can lead to the execution of malicious code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Code into Candidate Block [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_code_into_candidate_block__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Code Injection Vulnerability in New Code Path:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Detailed Analysis:** If the new code path (candidate) has vulnerabilities, an attacker could inject malicious code that is executed when the experiment runs. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in input handling or data processing within the candidate code.
* **Supply Malicious Input Specifically Targeting Candidate Logic:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium/High (Depending on candidate's function)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Detailed Analysis:** Even without direct code injection, crafted input could trigger vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the candidate code, leading to compromise. This requires understanding the candidate's logic and how to manipulate it.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Result Comparison Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_result_comparison_mechanism.md)

* This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the process by which Scientist determines if the control and candidate code produce the same results. Compromising this mechanism can allow malicious candidate code to be deemed safe.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Override or Modify the Comparison Function](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__override_or_modify_the_comparison_function.md)

* **Exploit Code Injection or Configuration Vulnerability:**
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High (Masking malicious behavior)
    * **Effort:** Medium/High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** High
    * **Detailed Analysis:** The `compare` block in `Scientist.run` defines how results are compared. If the application allows overriding this function and this mechanism is vulnerable (e.g., code injection or insecure configuration), an attacker could manipulate the comparison to always return "true," masking malicious behavior in the candidate.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Logging and Reporting Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__abuse_logging_and_reporting_mechanisms.md)

* This category of attacks targets the logging and reporting features of Scientist, aiming to inject malicious content or leak sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Payloads via Experiment Results [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_payloads_via_experiment_results__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Lack of Sanitization in Result Logging:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium/High
    * **Impact:** Medium (Potential for XSS or other log injection issues)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Detailed Analysis:** Scientist often logs the results of the experiment. If these logs are not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious payloads (e.g., JavaScript for XSS) that are executed when the logs are viewed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies or Interactions of Scientist](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_dependencies_or_interactions_of_scientist.md)

* This category of attacks focuses on vulnerabilities within the libraries that Scientist relies upon.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Leverage Vulnerabilities in Scientist's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__leverage_vulnerabilities_in_scientist's_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in RubyGems or other Libraries:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Can lead to various forms of compromise)
    * **Effort:** Low/Medium (If exploits are readily available)
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate (For known exploits)
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (If dependency scanning is in place)
    * **Detailed Analysis:** Scientist relies on other Ruby gems. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application. This often involves using known exploits for outdated or vulnerable libraries.
