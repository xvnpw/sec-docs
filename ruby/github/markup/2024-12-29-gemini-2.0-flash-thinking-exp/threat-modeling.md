### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving github/markup:

This list details high and critical security threats that directly involve the `github/markup` library.

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markup Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious script code directly within the markup content. The `github/markup` library then renders this content into HTML, and the injected script is executed by the victim's browser when they view the page. This occurs because `github/markup` processes the malicious markup and includes the script in its output.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, keystroke logging, and other client-side attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Threat:** HTML Injection Leading to Phishing or Defacement
    * **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML elements directly into the markup content. The `github/markup` library renders this content into HTML, and the injected HTML is displayed on the page. This can be used to create fake login forms or deface the application's content, as `github/markup` processes and outputs the malicious HTML.
    * **Impact:** Phishing attacks, credential theft, reputational damage to the application, user confusion and distrust.
    * **Risk Severity:** High

* **Threat:** Bypassing Security Measures through Markup Encoding
    * **Description:** Attackers use various markup encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entities, Unicode characters) within the markup content to obfuscate malicious payloads. The `github/markup` library processes this encoded content and renders it in a way that bypasses basic sanitization filters that might be applied before or after the `github/markup` processing. The vulnerability lies in `github/markup`'s interpretation of these encodings.
    * **Impact:** Successful injection of malicious scripts or HTML despite implemented security measures.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
