Okay, let's break down this XSS threat related to custom AsciiDoc macros/attributes in the context of the `github/markup` library.  Here's a comprehensive analysis:

## Deep Analysis: XSS via Custom AsciiDoc Macros/Attributes

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which XSS can be injected through custom AsciiDoc macros and attributes when using `github/markup`.
*   Identify specific code patterns and practices that introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and recommend best practices for secure implementation.
*   Provide actionable guidance to developers to prevent this type of XSS vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   The `github/markup` library and its interaction with Asciidoctor (the underlying AsciiDoc processor).
*   Custom AsciiDoc macros (inline and block) and attributes defined *within the application* using `github/markup`.  This does *not* include built-in Asciidoctor features, unless a vulnerability in `github/markup`'s handling of those features is identified.
*   The context of a web application where user-supplied input might be processed by these custom macros/attributes.
*   XSS vulnerabilities only.  Other potential vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection) are out of scope for this specific analysis, though they might be related.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We'll examine hypothetical (and potentially real-world, if available) examples of custom AsciiDoc macro/attribute implementations.  This will involve looking at how user input is handled, processed, and incorporated into the final HTML output.
2.  **Vulnerability Pattern Analysis:** We'll identify common coding patterns that lead to XSS vulnerabilities, such as insufficient input validation, lack of escaping, and improper use of templating engines.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Construction:** We'll create proof-of-concept exploit scenarios to demonstrate how an attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We'll assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (auditing, templating engines, input validation/sanitization, CSP) and identify potential weaknesses or limitations.
5.  **Best Practices Derivation:** Based on the analysis, we'll derive a set of concrete best practices for developers to follow when creating custom AsciiDoc macros/attributes.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Understanding the Attack Vector**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the interaction between user input, custom AsciiDoc extensions, and the HTML rendering process.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  **User Input:** An attacker provides malicious input, typically containing JavaScript code, disguised as a seemingly harmless AsciiDoc string. This input is intended to be processed by a custom macro or attribute.

2.  **Custom Macro/Attribute Processing:** The application, using `github/markup`, passes the user input to the custom AsciiDoc macro or attribute for processing.  This is where the vulnerability exists: if the custom code doesn't properly handle the input, the malicious script can be embedded within the generated HTML.

3.  **Asciidoctor and `github/markup`:** `github/markup` acts as a bridge, likely calling Asciidoctor (or a similar processor) to convert the AsciiDoc (including the output of the custom macro/attribute) into HTML.

4.  **HTML Rendering:** The resulting HTML, now containing the injected JavaScript, is rendered by the user's browser.  The browser executes the malicious script, leading to the XSS attack.

**2.2 Vulnerable Code Patterns**

Let's illustrate with some hypothetical (simplified) examples of vulnerable custom macros:

**Example 1: Vulnerable Inline Macro (Ruby)**

```ruby
# A custom macro to create a "styled" link.
#  [stylelink,url=https://example.com,text=Click Here,style=color:red]
Asciidoctor::Extensions.register do
  inline_macro do
    named :stylelink
    process do |parent, target, attrs|
      url = attrs['url']
      text = attrs['text']
      style = attrs['style']
      # VULNERABLE:  Directly embedding 'style' without sanitization.
      %(<a href="#{url}" style="#{style}">#{text}</a>)
    end
  end
end
```

**Exploit:**

An attacker could use the following AsciiDoc input:

```asciidoc
[stylelink,url=https://example.com,text=Click Here,style=";color:red;background:url(javascript:alert('XSS'))"]
```

This would generate HTML like:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" style=";color:red;background:url(javascript:alert('XSS'))">Click Here</a>
```

The `background:url(javascript:...)` part is a classic XSS technique.  When the user hovers over the link (or in some browsers, just by rendering the page), the JavaScript code `alert('XSS')` will execute.

**Example 2: Vulnerable Block Macro (Ruby)**

```ruby
# A custom macro to embed user-provided content in a div.
#  [userblock]
#  This is user content.
#  [/userblock]
Asciidoctor::Extensions.register do
  block_macro do
    named :userblock
    process do |parent, target, attrs|
      content = parent.content # Gets the content *inside* the block.
      # VULNERABLE: Directly embedding 'content' without sanitization.
      create_pass_block parent, "<div class='user-content'>#{content}</div>", attrs, subs: nil
    end
  end
end
```

**Exploit:**

```asciidoc
[userblock]
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
[/userblock]
```

This would generate:

```html
<div class='user-content'><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')"></div>
```

The `onerror` attribute of the `<img>` tag is another common XSS vector.  Since the image source (`x`) is invalid, the `onerror` handler will execute, triggering the alert.

**2.3 Key Vulnerability Factors:**

*   **Direct String Concatenation:**  The most common culprit is directly concatenating user-supplied strings into HTML without any escaping or sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Failing to validate the *type* and *content* of user input.  For example, allowing arbitrary CSS in a `style` attribute.
*   **Lack of Contextual Escaping:**  Even if some escaping is performed, it might not be appropriate for the specific HTML context.  For example, escaping quotes but not angle brackets (`<` and `>`).
*   **Misunderstanding of Asciidoctor's Security Model:**  Assuming that Asciidoctor itself will handle all sanitization.  While Asciidoctor has some built-in security features, custom extensions are *outside* of that protection unless explicitly designed to be secure.
*   **Using `subs: nil` inappropriately:** In the block macro example, `subs: nil` prevents Asciidoctor from applying its default substitutions (which *might* include some sanitization).  However, relying on this for security is fragile.  It's better to explicitly sanitize.

**2.4 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation**

Let's revisit the proposed mitigation strategies and assess their effectiveness:

*   **Thoroughly Audit Custom Code:**  **Essential.**  This is the first line of defense.  Developers *must* understand the potential risks and carefully review their code for vulnerabilities.  Automated security analysis tools can help, but manual review is crucial.

*   **Use a Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping:**  **Highly Recommended.**  Templating engines like ERB (with proper configuration), Slim, or Haml can automatically escape HTML entities, significantly reducing the risk of XSS.  Example (using ERB):

    ```ruby
    require 'erb'

    template = ERB.new <<-TEMPLATE
      <a href="<%= url %>" style="<%= style %>"><%= text %></a>
    TEMPLATE

    # Assuming 'url', 'text', and 'style' are from user input.
    # ERB will automatically escape them.
    html = template.result(binding)
    ```

    **Important:** Ensure the templating engine is configured for HTML escaping by default, and that the correct escaping context is used (e.g., attribute escaping for attributes, element content escaping for text).

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  **Crucial.**  Even with a templating engine, input validation is still important.  This involves:
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that the input is of the expected type (e.g., a string, a URL, a number).
    *   **Content Validation:**  Restrict the allowed characters and patterns.  For example, a URL should match a URL pattern, and a CSS style should not contain dangerous characters or keywords (like `javascript:`).
    *   **Sanitization:**  Remove or replace potentially dangerous characters or sequences.  Libraries like `sanitize` (Ruby) or OWASP's Java HTML Sanitizer can be used.  **Crucially, sanitization should be done *before* any templating.**

    ```ruby
    require 'sanitize'

    # Sanitize the 'style' attribute.  This is a very restrictive example.
    # You'd likely need a more sophisticated configuration for real-world use.
    sanitized_style = Sanitize.fragment(attrs['style'], Sanitize::Config::RESTRICTED)
    ```

*   **CSP (Content Security Policy):**  **Important Defense-in-Depth.**  CSP is a browser-based security mechanism that allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.).  A well-configured CSP can prevent XSS even if a vulnerability exists in your code.

    *   **Example CSP Header:**

        ```
        Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        ```

        This policy allows scripts only from the same origin (`'self'`) and a trusted CDN, and allows inline styles (which is generally discouraged but might be necessary in some cases).  It would block the `javascript:alert('XSS')` attack in our earlier example because it's not from an allowed source.

    *   **`'unsafe-inline'`:**  Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` if at all possible.  It significantly weakens the protection against XSS.  If you must use inline scripts, consider using nonces or hashes to allow only specific scripts.

    *   **CSP and Custom Macros:**  CSP primarily protects against injected *scripts*.  It's less effective against attacks that manipulate CSS (like the `background:url(javascript:...)` example), although a strict `style-src` can help.

**2.5 Best Practices**

Based on the analysis, here are the best practices for developers creating custom AsciiDoc macros/attributes:

1.  **Assume All User Input is Malicious:**  Treat *every* piece of data that comes from user input (directly or indirectly) as potentially hostile.

2.  **Use a Secure Templating Engine:**  Employ a templating engine with automatic HTML escaping, and ensure it's correctly configured.

3.  **Validate and Sanitize Input *Before* Templating:**  Perform strict input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to the templating engine.  Use a reputable sanitization library.

4.  **Understand HTML Context:**  Be aware of the different HTML contexts (element content, attributes, URLs, CSS) and use the appropriate escaping/sanitization techniques for each.

5.  **Avoid Direct String Concatenation:**  Minimize or eliminate direct string concatenation when building HTML.

6.  **Implement a Strong CSP:**  Use a Content Security Policy to provide an additional layer of defense.  Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` if possible.

7.  **Regularly Audit and Test:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

8.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep `github/markup`, Asciidoctor, and any related libraries up to date to benefit from security patches.

9.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant custom macros only the necessary permissions. Avoid giving them access to sensitive data or functionality they don't require.

10. **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working with AsciiDoc and `github/markup` are aware of these best practices and the potential risks of XSS.

### 3. Conclusion

XSS vulnerabilities through custom AsciiDoc macros/attributes in `github/markup` are a serious threat.  By understanding the attack vectors, vulnerable code patterns, and effective mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of introducing these vulnerabilities.  A combination of secure coding practices, input validation, sanitization, templating engines, and a strong CSP is essential for building secure applications that process user-supplied AsciiDoc content. The key takeaway is to never trust user input and to always sanitize and validate before rendering it as HTML.
