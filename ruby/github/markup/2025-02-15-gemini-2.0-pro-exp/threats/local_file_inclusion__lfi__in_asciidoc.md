Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Local File Inclusion (LFI) threat in AsciiDoc, as described, tailored for a development team using `github/markup`:

## Deep Analysis: Local File Inclusion (LFI) in AsciiDoc

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of the LFI vulnerability within the context of `github/markup` and AsciiDoc processing.
*   Identify specific code paths and configurations within `github/markup` and its interaction with AsciiDoc renderers (like `asciidoctor`) that could be vulnerable.
*   Assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and recommend concrete implementation steps for the development team.
*   Provide clear guidance on how to test for and prevent this vulnerability.
*   Determine if sandboxing or other isolation techniques are necessary and feasible.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses on:

*   The `github/markup` library itself, specifically how it invokes AsciiDoc rendering.
*   The interaction between `github/markup` and the underlying AsciiDoc renderer (primarily `asciidoctor`, but also considering potential alternatives).
*   The `include` directive within AsciiDoc and how it's handled.
*   The server environment where `github/markup` is deployed (file system permissions, user privileges).
*   User-supplied input that could influence the `include` directive's target.
*   The specific version(s) of `asciidoctor` and other relevant libraries in use.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to AsciiDoc processing or the `include` directive.
*   General server security hardening (beyond what's directly relevant to this LFI).
*   Vulnerabilities in other markup languages supported by `github/markup` (unless they share a similar `include`-like mechanism).

**1.3. Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the `github/markup` source code (particularly the AsciiDoc handling logic) to understand how it calls the AsciiDoc renderer and passes data.  We'll look for any points where user input might influence file paths.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Investigate the `asciidoctor` library (and any other relevant dependencies) to understand its `include` directive handling, security features, and known vulnerabilities.  This includes reviewing the `asciidoctor` documentation and security advisories.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Construct test cases with malicious AsciiDoc input (using path traversal techniques) to attempt to trigger the LFI vulnerability in a controlled environment.  This will involve setting up a test instance of `github/markup` and the AsciiDoc renderer.
*   **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Update the existing threat model based on the findings of the code review, dependency analysis, and dynamic testing.
*   **Mitigation Verification:**  Test the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies to ensure they prevent the vulnerability.
*   **Documentation Review:** Examine the official documentation of both `github/markup` and `asciidoctor` for any security-related recommendations or warnings.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Vulnerability Mechanics:**

The core of the LFI vulnerability lies in the AsciiDoc `include` directive.  This directive allows one AsciiDoc file to include the contents of another.  The vulnerability arises when:

1.  **User Input Controls the Path:**  An attacker can manipulate user-supplied input (e.g., a form field, URL parameter, or even content within a larger document) that is then used, directly or indirectly, to construct the file path passed to the `include` directive.
2.  **Insufficient Sanitization:** The application (or the AsciiDoc renderer) fails to properly sanitize the user-supplied input, allowing path traversal sequences like `../` to be injected.
3.  **Lack of Path Restriction:**  The application doesn't restrict the `include` directive to a specific, safe directory (a "jail" or "chroot").  This allows the attacker to traverse the file system arbitrarily.
4.  **File Read Permissions:** The user account under which the application runs has read access to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, source code).

**2.2.  `github/markup` and `asciidoctor` Interaction:**

`github/markup` acts as a wrapper, selecting the appropriate renderer based on the file extension.  For `.adoc` files, it likely uses `asciidoctor`.  The crucial point is *how* `github/markup` passes the file content and any associated options to `asciidoctor`.

*   **Potential Vulnerability Points in `github/markup`:**
    *   **Direct File Path Manipulation:** Does `github/markup` directly construct file paths based on user input before passing them to `asciidoctor`?  This is the most direct vulnerability.
    *   **Indirect Influence via Options:**  Does `github/markup` allow user input to influence options passed to `asciidoctor` that could affect the `include` directive's behavior (e.g., a base directory setting)?
    *   **Lack of Sandboxing:** Does `github/markup` provide any sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit `asciidoctor`'s file system access?

*   **`asciidoctor` Security Features:**
    *   **`safe` Mode:** `asciidoctor` has a "safe mode" that can restrict certain features, including the `include` directive.  We need to determine if `github/markup` uses this mode and, if so, which level of safe mode is enabled.  Different safe mode levels have different restrictions.
    *   **`base_dir` Option:** `asciidoctor` allows specifying a base directory for includes.  If this is set to a safe, restricted directory *and* path traversal is prevented, it can mitigate LFI.
    *   **`include_path` Option:** Similar to `base_dir`, this allows specifying a list of allowed directories for includes.

**2.3.  Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: Direct Path Traversal:**
    *   Attacker provides input: `../../../../etc/passwd`
    *   `github/markup` (or the application using it) directly uses this input in the `include` directive: `include::../../../../etc/passwd[]`
    *   `asciidoctor` processes the directive, reads `/etc/passwd`, and includes its contents in the rendered output.

*   **Scenario 2:  Indirect Path Traversal (if `base_dir` is controllable):**
    *   Attacker provides input that sets the `base_dir` to `/`.
    *   Attacker then provides input for the `include` directive: `etc/passwd`
    *   `asciidoctor` combines the (attacker-controlled) `base_dir` and the relative path, resulting in `/etc/passwd`.

*   **Scenario 3:  Bypassing Weak Sanitization:**
    *   Application attempts to remove `../` sequences but fails to handle variations like `....//` or URL-encoded versions (`%2e%2e%2f`).
    *   Attacker uses these variations to bypass the sanitization and achieve path traversal.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategy Analysis and Implementation:**

Let's analyze the proposed mitigations and provide concrete implementation steps:

*   **Disable `include` (if possible):**
    *   **Implementation:**  This is the most secure option.  If the application's functionality doesn't *require* the `include` directive, disable it entirely.  This can often be done through `asciidoctor`'s safe mode settings.  Specifically, set the safe mode to `server` or `secure`.  Check how `github/markup` allows configuring `asciidoctor`'s safe mode.  It might be a command-line option, an environment variable, or a configuration file.
    *   **Verification:**  Test with AsciiDoc files that use the `include` directive.  The rendered output should *not* include the content of the included file.  Instead, you should see an error or a warning.

*   **Strictly Control Allowed Paths:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Define a "Safe" Directory:** Create a dedicated directory (e.g., `/var/www/app/includes`) that will contain *only* the files that are allowed to be included.  Ensure this directory has appropriate permissions (read-only for the application user).
        2.  **Use `base_dir` and/or `include_path`:** Configure `asciidoctor` (via `github/markup`) to use this safe directory as the `base_dir` or add it to the `include_path`.  This restricts the search path for included files.
        3.  **Implement Robust Path Sanitization:**  Even with `base_dir`, *always* sanitize user input to prevent path traversal.  This is crucial.  Use a well-tested sanitization library or function.  Do *not* rely on simple string replacements.  Consider using a whitelist approach (allowing only specific characters) instead of a blacklist approach (removing forbidden characters).  Handle URL encoding, double encoding, and other bypass techniques.  A good approach is to:
            *   Normalize the path (resolve any `.` and `..` components).
            *   Check if the normalized path starts with the allowed "safe" directory.
            *   Reject the input if it doesn't.
    *   **Verification:**  Test with various path traversal attempts (e.g., `../`, `....//`, `%2e%2e%2f`).  The application should reject these attempts and *not* include any files outside the safe directory.

*   **Keep Libraries Updated:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a dependency management system (e.g., Bundler for Ruby, npm for Node.js) to keep `asciidoctor`, `github/markup`, and all other dependencies up to date.  Regularly check for security advisories related to these libraries.  Automate the update process as much as possible.
    *   **Verification:**  Regularly review the changelogs and security advisories of your dependencies.

*   **Run with Least Privilege:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Create a dedicated user account with minimal privileges to run the application.  This user should *only* have read access to the necessary files and directories (including the "safe" directory for includes).  It should *not* have write access to any sensitive areas of the file system.  Avoid running the application as `root`.
    *   **Verification:**  Verify the user account's permissions using commands like `ls -l` and `id`.  Attempt to access sensitive files from within the application (as a test) to ensure the access is denied.

**2.5.  Sandboxing and Isolation:**

Given the high risk of LFI, strong sandboxing is highly recommended.  Here are some options:

*   **Containers (Docker):**  Running the application within a Docker container provides a significant level of isolation.  The container has its own isolated file system, and you can precisely control which directories from the host are mounted into the container (and with what permissions).  This is the *preferred* approach.
*   **Chroot Jail:**  A `chroot` jail restricts the application's root directory to a specific subdirectory.  This is a more traditional approach than containers, but it can be more complex to set up correctly and may have limitations.
*   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  These mandatory access control (MAC) systems can be used to enforce fine-grained restrictions on what the application process can access.  This is a more advanced technique that requires careful configuration.

**2.6. Testing:**

*   **Unit Tests:**  Create unit tests for the path sanitization logic to ensure it handles various edge cases and bypass attempts.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Create integration tests that simulate user input and verify that the `include` directive behaves as expected (either disabled or restricted to the safe directory).
*   **Security Tests (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing specifically targeting the LFI vulnerability.  Use automated tools and manual techniques to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Local File Inclusion in AsciiDoc is a serious vulnerability that can lead to sensitive data disclosure and potential code execution.  The combination of `github/markup` and `asciidoctor` requires careful configuration and robust security measures to mitigate this risk.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Sandboxing:** Use Docker containers to isolate the application and its dependencies. This provides the strongest protection against LFI.
2.  **Implement Strict Path Control:**  Define a "safe" directory for includes, use `asciidoctor`'s `base_dir` or `include_path` options, and implement *robust* path sanitization that handles all known bypass techniques.
3.  **Disable `include` if Unnecessary:** If the `include` directive is not essential, disable it entirely using `asciidoctor`'s safe mode.
4.  **Run with Least Privilege:**  Use a dedicated, low-privilege user account to run the application.
5.  **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update `asciidoctor`, `github/markup`, and all other dependencies.
6.  **Thorough Testing:**  Implement comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and security tests, to verify the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
7. **Code Review:** Review github/markup code to check how it is calling asciidoctor.

By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of LFI vulnerabilities in their application.  Continuous monitoring and security audits are also essential to maintain a strong security posture.
