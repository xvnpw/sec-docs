Okay, let's create a design document for the GitHub Markup project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

GitHub Markup is a critical component of the GitHub platform, responsible for rendering various markup languages into HTML. It's used across the platform for displaying READMEs, issues, pull requests, comments, and more.

Priorities and Goals:

-   Reliability: The service must be highly available and resilient to failures, as it impacts the usability of the entire GitHub platform.
-   Security: Preventing XSS vulnerabilities is paramount, as user-provided markup could be exploited to attack other users.
-   Performance: Rendering should be fast and efficient to ensure a smooth user experience.
-   Maintainability: The codebase should be easy to understand and modify, as new markup languages and features are added regularly.
-   Accuracy: Markup should be rendered correctly and consistently, according to the specifications of each language.

Business Risks:

-   Service Outage: If Markup is unavailable, large parts of GitHub become unusable, impacting millions of users and potentially causing significant business disruption.
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities: Successful XSS attacks could lead to account compromise, data breaches, and reputational damage.
-   Performance Degradation: Slow rendering times can frustrate users and reduce engagement with the platform.
-   Inaccurate Rendering: Incorrectly rendered markup can lead to miscommunication and confusion.
-   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into the Markup service.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

-   security control: Input Sanitization: GitHub Markup uses a combination of whitelisting, filtering, and escaping to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This is implemented primarily within the various libraries used to parse and render different markup languages (e.g., `github-markup` itself, and underlying libraries like `commonmarker` for CommonMark, etc.).
-   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): GitHub employs CSP headers to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities. This is implemented at the web server level (serving GitHub.com) and is not directly part of the `github-markup` library itself.
-   security control: Regular Dependency Updates: GitHub likely has processes in place to keep dependencies up-to-date, reducing the risk of known vulnerabilities. This is implied by the nature of the project and GitHub's overall security practices, but not explicitly stated in the repository itself.
-   security control: Code Reviews: All code changes undergo review by other engineers, helping to catch potential security issues before they are merged. This is a standard practice on GitHub.
-   security control: Automated Testing: The project includes a test suite to ensure that markup is rendered correctly and to help prevent regressions.
-   security control: Static Analysis: GitHub likely uses static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. This is a common practice at GitHub, but not explicitly mentioned in this specific repository.

Accepted Risks:

-   accepted risk: Complexity of Markup Parsing: The inherent complexity of parsing various markup languages means that there is always a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
-   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries: The project depends on external libraries for parsing and rendering, introducing a dependency on the security of those libraries.
-   accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: There is always a risk of zero-day vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries or the Markup code itself.

Recommended Security Controls:

-   security control: Fuzz Testing: Implement fuzz testing to proactively discover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in the parsing and rendering logic.
-   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, both internal and external, to identify potential weaknesses.
-   security control: Supply Chain Security Measures: Implement robust supply chain security measures, such as software bill of materials (SBOM) generation and dependency analysis, to mitigate the risk of compromised dependencies.

Security Requirements:

-   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Markup library itself, as it operates on unauthenticated input. Authentication is handled at a higher level in the GitHub application.
-   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as Markup renders content based on user input, but the authorization to view that content is handled elsewhere.
-   Input Validation:
    -   Strictly enforce whitelisting of allowed HTML tags and attributes.
    -   Sanitize all user-provided input to prevent XSS attacks.
    -   Validate input against the expected format for each markup language.
    -   Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.
-   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as Markup does not handle sensitive data. However, any URLs generated should use HTTPS.
-   Output Encoding: Ensure that all output is properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    GitHubRepository["GitHub Repository\n(github/markup)"]
    CIEnvironment["CI Environment\n(e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    Tests["Run Tests"]
    GemPackage["Gem Package\n(RubyGems)"]

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> GitHubRepository
    GitHubRepository -- "Triggers build" --> CIEnvironment
    CIEnvironment -- "Runs" --> Tests
    Tests -- "If successful" --> CIEnvironment
    CIEnvironment -- "Builds" --> GemPackage
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A CI environment (likely GitHub Actions, given that it's a GitHub project) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The CI environment sets up the build environment (e.g., installs dependencies).
4.  The CI environment runs the test suite.
5.  If the tests pass, the CI environment builds the gem package.
6.  The gem package is likely published to RubyGems.org, making it available for use by the GitHub web application.

Security Controls:

-   security control: CI/CD Pipeline: Automated build and deployment through a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) ensures consistency and reduces the risk of manual errors.
-   security control: Automated Testing: The test suite helps to catch bugs and regressions before they are deployed.
-   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses a dependency management system (Bundler for Ruby) to manage dependencies and ensure that the correct versions are used.
-   security control: Static Analysis (Likely): GitHub likely uses static analysis tools as part of their CI process to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
-   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

-   Rendering of user-generated content (READMEs, issues, pull requests, comments, etc.).
-   Displaying code with syntax highlighting.
-   Providing a consistent and reliable user experience across the GitHub platform.

Data:

-   User-provided markup text (low sensitivity, but potential for XSS).
-   Rendered HTML (low sensitivity).
-   No direct handling of highly sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) within the Markup library itself. The primary risk is the *injection* of malicious content that could *target* sensitive data handled elsewhere in the GitHub application.

Sensitivity:

-   The markup text itself is generally not sensitive, but it can be used as a vector for attacks (XSS). The primary concern is the potential for malicious code injection, not the confidentiality of the markup itself.
