## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1: Craft input with deeply nested structures (ReDoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_craft_input_with_deeply_nested_structures__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input containing deeply nested Markdown structures (e.g., many opening square brackets `[[[[[...`, or asterisks `******...`). This exploits vulnerabilities in the regular expressions used by `cmark-gfm` (the Markdown processor) to cause exponential backtracking, consuming excessive CPU resources and leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Known issue, but requires specific input)
*   **Impact:** High (DoS can disrupt service)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple crafted input)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of ReDoS)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring CPU usage or analyzing logs for slow requests)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Limit input length.
    *   Use a ReDoS-resistant regex engine (if possible, and if you have control over the underlying engine).
    *   Implement input sanitization/validation to remove or limit nested structures.
    *   Monitor CPU usage to detect potential ReDoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1: Inject malicious `<script>` tags (HTML Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_inject_malicious__script__tags__html_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows raw HTML input within Markdown, the attacker can inject malicious `<script>` tags containing JavaScript code. This code will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** High (If raw HTML is enabled)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Client-side XSS, potential for session hijacking, data theft, defacement)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple HTML injection)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Client-side effects may be visible, server-side detection requires input/output analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Preferred:** Disable raw HTML input entirely.
    *   **If raw HTML is required:** Use a robust, well-maintained HTML sanitizer (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach in Python) *after* `github/markup` processing.  *Never* rely on `github/markup` to sanitize HTML.  The sanitizer should whitelist safe tags and attributes and remove or escape dangerous ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.2: Inject malicious attributes (HTML Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_2_inject_malicious_attributes__html_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Even if `<script>` tags are blocked, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within allowed HTML tag attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, etc.  This achieves the same result as injecting `<script>` tags – client-side XSS.
*   **Likelihood:** High (If raw HTML is enabled and sanitization is weak)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Similar to 1.1.2.1 - Client-side XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple HTML injection)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Similar to 1.1.2.1)
*   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.2.1 – use a robust HTML sanitizer *after* `github/markup` processing. The sanitizer must handle attributes correctly, either by whitelisting safe attributes or by properly escaping dangerous ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1: Command injection (CLI)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_command_injection__cli_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses the `github/markup` command-line interface and passes user-supplied input directly to shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands. This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (If best practices are followed)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE on the server – complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (If vulnerable, exploitation is easy)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires understanding of command injection)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (If vulnerable, exploitation attempts may be visible in logs)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* directly construct shell commands using user input.
    *   Use parameterized commands or a library that handles escaping properly (e.g., `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` in Python, or prepared statements in other languages).
    *   Avoid using the shell entirely if possible.
