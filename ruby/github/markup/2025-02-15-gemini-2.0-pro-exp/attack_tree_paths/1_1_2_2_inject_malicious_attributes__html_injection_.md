# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2.2 - Inject Malicious Attributes (HTML Injection)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability represented by attack tree path 1.1.2.2 (Injecting malicious attributes for HTML Injection) within the context of an application using the `github/markup` library.  We aim to:

*   Determine the specific mechanisms by which this attack can be executed.
*   Assess the effectiveness of `github/markup`'s built-in protections (if any) against this attack vector.
*   Identify the precise points in the application's data flow where this vulnerability is most likely to be exploited.
*   Propose concrete and actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendation in the attack tree.
*   Evaluate the residual risk after implementing mitigations.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path 1.1.2.2.  It considers:

*   **Input Sources:**  Any user-controlled input that is processed by `github/markup`. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Markdown text areas.
    *   Uploaded files containing markup (e.g., `.md`, `.rst`).
    *   Data fetched from external sources (e.g., APIs) that is then rendered using `github/markup`.
    *   Configuration settings that might influence `github/markup`'s behavior (e.g., enabling/disabling raw HTML).
*   **`github/markup` Library:**  We will examine the library's documentation, source code (if necessary and time permits), and known behavior to understand how it handles HTML attributes.  We will specifically look for any configuration options related to attribute sanitization.
*   **Application Code:**  We will analyze how the application integrates with `github/markup`.  This includes:
    *   How the application calls `github/markup` functions.
    *   What data is passed to `github/markup`.
    *   How the output of `github/markup` is used (e.g., directly inserted into the DOM, further processed, etc.).
*   **Post-`github/markup` Processing:**  We will analyze any sanitization or escaping steps performed *after* `github/markup` has processed the input. This is crucial because `github/markup` itself is not a sanitizer.
*   **Client-Side Environment:**  We will consider the impact of different browsers and their handling of potentially malicious HTML attributes.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors in the broader attack tree, except where they directly relate to understanding or mitigating 1.1.2.2.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the official `github/markup` documentation, paying close attention to sections on security, HTML handling, and configuration options.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  Examine relevant parts of the application's codebase that interact with `github/markup`.  This will focus on input validation, sanitization, and output handling.  If necessary, we will also examine parts of the `github/markup` source code to understand its internal workings.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Create simple, targeted PoC exploits to demonstrate the vulnerability in a controlled environment.  This will help confirm our understanding and assess the effectiveness of mitigations.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Based on the above steps, identify the specific vulnerabilities and their root causes.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Propose detailed, actionable mitigation strategies, including specific code changes, library configurations, and best practices.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after implementing the proposed mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.2

### 2.1. Understanding the Attack

The attack leverages the fact that HTML attributes can contain JavaScript code that executes under certain conditions.  Common examples include:

*   **`onload`:** Executes when the element has finished loading.
*   **`onerror`:** Executes when an error occurs while loading the element.
*   **`onmouseover`:** Executes when the mouse pointer moves over the element.
*   **`onclick`:** Executes when the user clicks on the element.
*   **`onfocus`:** Executes when the element gains focus.
*   **`onblur`:** Executes when the element loses focus.
*  **`onchange`**: Executes when element value is changed.
*  **`oninput`**: Executes when element gets user input.
*  **`onkeydown`**: Executes when user is pressing a key.
*  **`onkeyup`**: Executes when user releases a key.
*  **`onkeypress`**: Executes when user presses a key.

An attacker can inject these attributes into allowed HTML tags, bypassing restrictions on `<script>` tags.  For example, even if `<script>` tags are completely blocked, an attacker might be able to inject:

```html
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
```

This seemingly harmless `<img>` tag will trigger an alert box because the `src` attribute points to a non-existent image ("x"), causing the `onerror` handler to execute.  The attacker's JavaScript code (`alert('XSS')`) is then executed in the context of the victim's browser.

### 2.2. `github/markup` and Attribute Handling

`github/markup` is a library for rendering various markup languages (Markdown, reStructuredText, etc.) into HTML.  Crucially, **`github/markup` is *not* an HTML sanitizer.** Its primary purpose is to convert markup to HTML, not to ensure the safety of that HTML.  This is explicitly stated in the `github/markup` documentation:

> "Markup is not an HTML sanitizer. It is possible for specially-crafted markup to generate HTML that is potentially unsafe. You should always run the output of Markup through an HTML sanitizer before displaying it to your users."

This means that `github/markup` will, by default, pass through any HTML (including attributes) that is present in the input markup, *if* raw HTML is enabled.  If raw HTML is disabled, `github/markup` will typically escape the HTML, rendering it as plain text rather than executable code.  However, the specific behavior depends on the underlying rendering library used for each markup language.

The key configuration point here is whether raw HTML is allowed.  This is often controlled by a setting or flag passed to the `github/markup` function or configured globally.

### 2.3. Application-Specific Vulnerabilities

The vulnerability arises when:

1.  **Raw HTML is Enabled (or Insufficiently Restricted):**  The application configures `github/markup` to allow raw HTML, or it uses a markup language that inherently allows some HTML (e.g., Markdown allows a subset of HTML).
2.  **Missing or Weak Post-Processing Sanitization:**  The application does *not* perform robust HTML sanitization *after* `github/markup` has processed the input.  This is the most critical vulnerability.  Even if raw HTML is disabled, there might be edge cases or bypasses in the underlying rendering libraries that could allow attribute injection.
3.  **Direct DOM Insertion:** The application takes the output of `github/markup` and directly inserts it into the DOM without further escaping or sanitization.  This is common in JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular if not handled carefully.

### 2.4. Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

Let's assume the application uses Markdown and allows a limited subset of HTML.  A simple PoC could be:

**Input (Markdown):**

```markdown
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
```

**Expected Behavior (Without Sanitization):**

`github/markup` will convert this to the same HTML:

```html
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
```

When this HTML is rendered in a browser, the `onerror` event will fire, and the alert box will appear, demonstrating successful XSS.

**Expected Behavior (With Sanitization):**

A robust sanitizer (like DOMPurify) would either:

*   **Remove the `onerror` attribute:** `<img src="x">`
*   **Escape the `onerror` attribute (less desirable):** `<img src="x" onerror="alert(&#39;XSS&#39;)">` (This would prevent execution)

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation is to use a robust HTML sanitizer *after* `github/markup` processing.  Here are detailed recommendations:

1.  **Use a Robust HTML Sanitizer:**
    *   **Recommended Library:** DOMPurify is a widely used and well-maintained HTML sanitizer.  It is specifically designed to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Integration:**  Integrate the sanitizer into your application's data flow.  The output of `github/markup` should be passed *directly* to the sanitizer *before* being inserted into the DOM or used in any other sensitive context.
    *   **Configuration:**  Configure the sanitizer to allow only a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes.  Start with a strict whitelist and add elements only as needed.  Specifically, review and restrict the allowed attributes.  Avoid overly permissive configurations.
        * Example (using DOMPurify in JavaScript):
          ```javascript
          import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

          const dirtyHTML = githubMarkup.render(userInput); // Assuming githubMarkup is your wrapper
          const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirtyHTML, {
              ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a', 'img'], // Example whitelist
              ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'src', 'alt'] // Example whitelist
          });
          // Now use cleanHTML safely
          ```

2.  **Disable Raw HTML (If Possible):**  If your application's requirements allow it, disable raw HTML input in `github/markup`'s configuration.  This provides an additional layer of defense, but it should *not* be relied upon as the sole mitigation.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in your application's HTTP headers.  CSP can help mitigate XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.  A well-configured CSP can prevent inline scripts (like those injected via attributes) from executing.
    *   Example CSP header (restrictive):
        ```
        Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
        ```
    *   This CSP would prevent the execution of inline scripts, including those in `onerror` attributes.  You would need to adjust the `script-src` directive to allow any legitimate scripts your application uses.  Using nonces or hashes for allowed scripts is recommended.

4.  **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):**  While input validation is generally a good practice, it is *not* a reliable defense against XSS in this context.  It is extremely difficult to reliably filter out all potentially malicious HTML attributes using regular expressions or other input validation techniques.  Sanitization is the preferred approach.

5.  **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Ensure that any user-supplied data that is displayed in different contexts (e.g., HTML attributes, JavaScript code, CSS) is properly encoded for that context.  This is a general security principle that can help prevent other types of injection attacks.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

### 2.6. Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing the above mitigations (especially a robust HTML sanitizer and CSP), the residual risk should be significantly reduced.  However, some residual risk may remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There is always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the sanitizer library or the browser's HTML parsing engine.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect configuration of the sanitizer or CSP could leave loopholes that an attacker could exploit.
*   **Bypass Techniques:**  Sophisticated attackers may find ways to bypass the sanitizer's protections, although this is significantly more difficult with a well-maintained library like DOMPurify.
* **Complex Application Logic**: If application has complex logic that manipulates HTML after sanitization, it can introduce new vulnerabilities.

To minimize these residual risks, it is crucial to:

*   **Keep Libraries Updated:**  Regularly update the sanitizer library (DOMPurify) and other dependencies to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories related to the libraries you use.
*   **Regularly Review Configuration:**  Periodically review the sanitizer and CSP configurations to ensure they are still appropriate and effective.
*   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding practices throughout the application to minimize the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities.

By combining a robust HTML sanitizer, a strong CSP, and secure coding practices, the risk of XSS attacks via malicious HTML attributes can be effectively mitigated, even when using a library like `github/markup` that is not designed for sanitization.
