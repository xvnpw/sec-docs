# Deep Analysis: Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Malicious Markup in `github/markup`

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities stemming from the use of include directives within markup languages processed by `github/markup`.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and define robust mitigation strategies to prevent exploitation.  This analysis will inform secure configuration and usage guidelines for development teams using this library.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Library:** `github/markup` (https://github.com/github/markup)
*   **Attack Vector:**  Malicious markup containing include directives (specifically `include::` in AsciiDoc and `.. include::` in reStructuredText).
*   **Vulnerability:**  Local File Inclusion (LFI) â€“ the ability to include arbitrary local files from the server.
*   **Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive information, potential code execution (depending on included file types and server configuration).
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential vulnerabilities within `github/markup` (e.g., XSS, command injection) unless they directly relate to the LFI vector via include directives.  It also does not cover vulnerabilities in the underlying markup parsers themselves (e.g., vulnerabilities within the Asciidoctor or Docutils libraries), although the interaction between `github/markup` and these parsers is considered.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the `github/markup` source code to understand how it handles include directives.  This includes identifying:
    *   Which markup languages support include directives.
    *   How `github/markup` interacts with the underlying parsers (e.g., Asciidoctor, Docutils) to process these directives.
    *   Any existing configuration options or security mechanisms related to include directives.
    *   Any default settings that might pose a risk.

2.  **Parser Documentation Review:**  Consult the documentation for the relevant markup parsers (Asciidoctor for AsciiDoc, Docutils for reStructuredText) to understand:
    *   The syntax and semantics of include directives.
    *   Any security considerations or recommendations provided by the parser developers.
    *   Configuration options for controlling include behavior.

3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Construct and analyze various malicious markup payloads to understand how they could be used to exploit LFI vulnerabilities. This includes:
    *   Testing absolute paths (`/etc/passwd`).
    *   Testing relative paths (`../../../../etc/passwd`).
    *   Testing variations in syntax (e.g., different encodings, whitespace).
    *   Testing inclusion of files with different extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.conf`, `.log`).

4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of successful LFI exploitation, considering:
    *   Types of sensitive information that could be disclosed.
    *   Potential for code execution (e.g., if PHP files or other executable scripts can be included).
    *   Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including:
    *   Disabling include directives completely.
    *   Implementing strict path validation (if include is absolutely necessary).
    *   Running the rendering process with least privilege.
    *   Combining multiple mitigation strategies.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1 Code Review Findings (`github/markup`)

`github/markup` acts as a dispatcher, selecting the appropriate underlying rendering library based on the file extension.  It doesn't directly handle the parsing of include directives; that responsibility lies with the chosen renderer (Asciidoctor, Docutils, etc.).  The crucial aspect is how `github/markup` *configures* these renderers.

Key observations from a hypothetical code review (since we don't have direct access to the *current* internal implementation):

*   **Renderer Selection:** `github/markup` likely uses a mapping (e.g., a hash table) to associate file extensions with renderers.  `.adoc` -> Asciidoctor, `.rst` -> Docutils.
*   **Configuration Passing:**  `github/markup` *should* provide a mechanism to pass configuration options to the underlying renderers.  This is where the ability to disable or restrict include directives would reside.  *If this mechanism is missing or inadequate, it's a major vulnerability.*
*   **Default Settings:**  The *default* configuration passed to the renderers is critical.  If include directives are enabled by default *without* restrictions, the application is vulnerable out-of-the-box.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** `github/markup` itself likely does *not* perform any sanitization or validation of the markup content *before* passing it to the renderer.  This is expected, as it's the renderer's job to parse the markup.

### 4.2 Parser Documentation Review

*   **Asciidoctor (AsciiDoc):**
    *   `include::` directive is a core feature.
    *   Supports absolute and relative paths.
    *   Asciidoctor provides the `safe_mode` attribute, which can be set to different levels (e.g., `server`, `safe`, `secure`).  `secure` mode disables include directives.  The `:safe-mode: secure` attribute must be set.
    *   Asciidoctor also offers the `base_dir` attribute to restrict the root directory for includes.  This is *less* secure than disabling includes entirely.
*   **Docutils (reStructuredText):**
    *   `.. include::` directive is a standard feature.
    *   Supports absolute and relative paths.
    *   Docutils provides the `file_insertion_enabled` setting, which *must* be set to `False` to disable include directives.
    *   Docutils also has a `source_path` setting, but it's primarily for resolving relative paths within the document, not for security.  It's *not* a reliable security mechanism on its own.

### 4.3 Attack Vector Analysis

The following attack vectors are highly likely to be successful if include directives are enabled and not properly restricted:

*   **Basic Absolute Path:**
    ```asciidoc
    include::/etc/passwd[]
    ```
    ```rst
    .. include:: /etc/passwd
    ```
    This attempts to include the system's password file.

*   **Relative Path Traversal:**
    ```asciidoc
    include::../../../../etc/passwd[]
    ```
    ```rst
    .. include:: ../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
    This uses relative path traversal to reach the `/etc/passwd` file, even if a `base_dir` is set (unless the `base_dir` is extremely restrictive and chroot-like).

*   **Encoded Characters (Potentially):**
    ```asciidoc
    include::%2Fetc%2Fpasswd[]
    ```
    ```rst
    .. include:: %2Fetc%2Fpasswd
    ```
    URL-encoded characters *might* bypass some naive path validation checks (though a good implementation should decode these).

*   **Null Byte Injection (Less Likely):**
    ```asciidoc
    include::/etc/passwd%00.txt[]
    ```
    ```rst
    .. include:: /etc/passwd%00.txt
    ```
    Null byte injection is less likely to work in modern systems and with well-written parsers, but it's worth considering.

* **Including configuration files:**
    ```
    include::/var/www/config/config.php[]
    ```
    ```rst
    .. include:: /var/www/config/config.php
    ```
    This attempts to include application configuration file.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The most immediate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information.  This could include:
    *   System files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, system logs).
    *   Application configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys, etc.).
    *   Source code files.
    *   Internal documents.

*   **Potential Code Execution:**  If the attacker can include files containing executable code (e.g., PHP files, shell scripts), and the server is configured to execute those files, this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  This is a *much* higher severity impact.  For example, if the attacker can include a PHP file that contains `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`, they can then execute arbitrary commands on the server.

*   **Integrity and Availability:** While the primary impact is on confidentiality, LFI can also lead to integrity and availability issues.  For example, an attacker might be able to include a file that overwrites critical system files or disrupts the application's functionality.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

1.  **Disable Include Directives (Strongest Mitigation):**
    *   **AsciiDoc:**  Ensure `github/markup` sets the `:safe-mode: secure` attribute when invoking Asciidoctor.  This is the most reliable way to prevent AsciiDoc-based LFI.
    *   **reStructuredText:** Ensure `github/markup` sets the `file_insertion_enabled` setting to `False` when invoking Docutils.  This is essential for preventing reStructuredText-based LFI.
    *   **Effectiveness:** This is the *most effective* mitigation, as it completely eliminates the attack vector.
    *   **Recommendation:** This is the *primary* and *strongly recommended* mitigation strategy.

2.  **Strict Path Validation (Weak Mitigation - Discouraged):**
    *   **Implementation:**  If include directives *must* be enabled (which is highly discouraged), implement *extremely* strict path validation.  This would involve:
        *   Defining a single, whitelisted, isolated directory for included files.
        *   *Never* allowing absolute paths.
        *   *Never* allowing relative paths that traverse outside the whitelisted directory (e.g., using `..`).
        *   Validating the file extension to ensure it's a safe type.
        *   Potentially using a chroot jail to further restrict the file system access of the rendering process.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  This is *much less effective* than disabling includes entirely.  It's prone to errors and bypasses.  Even with careful implementation, there's a risk of overlooking a potential attack vector.
    *   **Recommendation:**  *Strongly discouraged.*  Only consider this if disabling includes is absolutely impossible, and even then, with extreme caution and thorough security review.

3.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Ensure the process that runs `github/markup` and the underlying renderers has the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  It should *not* run as root or with any elevated privileges.  It should only have read access to the necessary files and directories.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  This is a *defense-in-depth* measure.  It doesn't prevent LFI itself, but it limits the impact of a successful exploit.  If the process has limited privileges, the attacker can only access files that the process has access to.
    *   **Recommendation:**  *Always* implement least privilege, regardless of other mitigation strategies.

4.  **Input Sanitization (Not Applicable):**
    *   Input sanitization is generally *not* effective against LFI via include directives.  The problem is not malformed input, but rather the *intended* functionality of the include directive itself.

5. **Regular security audits and penetration testing:**
    *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Local File Inclusion (LFI) via malicious markup containing include directives is a high-severity vulnerability that can be exploited through `github/markup` if the underlying rendering libraries (Asciidoctor, Docutils) are not properly configured.  The *primary* and *most effective* mitigation is to *completely disable include directives* in the configuration passed to these renderers.  Strict path validation is a *much weaker* mitigation and is strongly discouraged.  Running the rendering process with least privilege is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.  Development teams using `github/markup` must prioritize secure configuration to prevent LFI vulnerabilities.
