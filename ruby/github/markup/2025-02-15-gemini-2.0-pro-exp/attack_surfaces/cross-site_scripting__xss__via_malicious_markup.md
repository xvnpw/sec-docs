# Deep Analysis: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `github/markup`

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that can arise when using the `github/markup` library, identify specific attack vectors, and propose robust mitigation strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to securely integrate and use `github/markup`.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on XSS vulnerabilities related to the `github/markup` library.  It covers:

*   How `github/markup` processes user-supplied markup and the potential for injection.
*   Specific HTML tags, attributes, and encodings that could be used in XSS attacks.
*   The interaction between `github/markup` and its dependencies in the context of XSS.
*   The role of different markup languages (Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, etc.) supported by `github/markup`.
*   Mitigation strategies, including configuration, coding practices, and security policies.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, SQL injection) unless they directly relate to XSS.
*   Vulnerabilities in the application's code *outside* of the direct use of `github/markup` for rendering user-provided content.
*   General web security best practices that are not specifically related to `github/markup`.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the `github/markup` source code (and relevant dependencies, particularly HTML sanitizers) to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern.  This includes looking at how input is parsed, sanitized, and rendered.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** Investigate known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and publicly disclosed XSS exploits related to `github/markup` and its underlying libraries (e.g., `html-pipeline`, specific sanitizers).
3.  **Fuzzing (Conceptual):**  While we won't perform live fuzzing in this document, we'll conceptually describe how fuzzing could be used to discover new XSS vectors.  Fuzzing involves providing a wide range of malformed and unexpected inputs to the library to identify edge cases and unexpected behavior.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  Compare the library's default configuration and recommended usage against established web security best practices for preventing XSS.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, considering their practicality and impact on functionality.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1.  `github/markup`'s Role and Dependencies

`github/markup` acts as a facade, selecting and invoking appropriate rendering libraries based on the file extension.  It relies heavily on `html-pipeline` for HTML sanitization.  The core of the XSS risk lies in:

*   **`html-pipeline`'s Sanitization:**  The effectiveness of the sanitization process is paramount.  `html-pipeline` uses a whitelist-based approach, allowing only specific HTML tags and attributes.  The configuration of this whitelist is *critical*.  A misconfiguration (allowing dangerous tags or attributes) or a bug in the sanitizer itself can lead to XSS.
*   **Markup Language Parsers:**  Each markup language (Markdown, AsciiDoc, etc.) has its own parser.  These parsers must correctly handle potentially malicious input and escape or remove dangerous constructs *before* the HTML sanitization stage.  A vulnerability in a parser could allow an attacker to inject raw HTML that bypasses the sanitizer.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in any of the underlying libraries (e.g., a Markdown parser, `html-pipeline`, or a gem it depends on) can be exploited.

### 4.2. Specific Attack Vectors

The provided examples highlight several common XSS attack vectors.  Let's break them down and add more:

*   **Direct `<script>` Injection:**  The most obvious attack.  `github/markup` *should* always block this, but it's the first thing an attacker will try.  This includes variations like `<SCRIPT>` (case-insensitive), `<scr<script>ipt>` (nested tags to bypass simple string replacement), and encoded versions.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitization should remove `<script>` tags completely.  CSP should prevent inline scripts from executing.

*   **Event Handlers:**  Attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc., can execute JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`
    *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitization should *never* allow any event handler attributes.

*   **`javascript:` URLs:**  Using `javascript:` in `href` or `src` attributes can execute code.
    *   **Example:** `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>`
    *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitization should carefully validate URLs and block any `javascript:` protocol URLs.

*   **CSS-Based XSS:**  Exploiting CSS properties like `background-image` or using CSS expressions (older browsers).
    *   **Example:** `<div style="background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))">`
    *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitization should restrict allowed CSS properties and values, disallowing `url()` with `javascript:` and any CSS expressions.

*   **SVG-Based XSS:**  SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) can contain embedded scripts.
    *   **Example:** `<svg><animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s>`
    *   **Mitigation:**  If SVG is allowed, the sanitizer must *very* carefully parse and sanitize the SVG content, removing any script elements or event handlers within the SVG.  It's often safer to disallow SVG entirely if it's not essential.

*   **Data URIs:**  Data URIs can be used to embed malicious content, including scripts.
    *   **Example:** `<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,...encoded SVG with script...">`
    *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitization should either disallow data URIs entirely or strictly limit their use and content type.

*   **Character Encoding Attacks:**  Attackers might try to use HTML entities, Unicode escapes, or other encoding tricks to bypass sanitization.
    *   **Example:**  `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;` (HTML entities) or `\u003cscript\u003ealert('XSS');\u003c/script\u003e` (Unicode escapes)
    *   **Mitigation:**  The sanitizer should decode HTML entities and Unicode escapes *before* performing sanitization.

*   **Mismatched Tag Exploits:**  Exploiting unclosed tags or mismatched tags to confuse the parser and inject code.
    *   **Example:**  `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')"//>` (commenting out the closing quote)
    *   **Mitigation:**  The HTML parser should be robust and handle malformed HTML gracefully, either correcting it or rejecting the input.

*   **Mutation XSS (mXSS):**  A more advanced technique where the attacker leverages the browser's DOM manipulation to create an XSS vulnerability *after* sanitization.  This often involves exploiting subtle differences in how browsers handle invalid HTML.
    *   **Mitigation:**  mXSS is very difficult to defend against.  Using a well-vetted and actively maintained sanitizer (like the one in `html-pipeline`) is crucial.  Regular updates are essential.

*  **Exploiting Raw HTML Directives:** As shown in the examples, some markup languages (AsciiDoc, reStructuredText) have directives to include raw HTML.  These *must* be disabled.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure that any configuration options that allow raw HTML inclusion are disabled.

### 4.3. Fuzzing (Conceptual)

Fuzzing `github/markup` for XSS would involve:

1.  **Input Generation:**  Creating a large corpus of input strings, including:
    *   Valid markup (baseline).
    *   Invalid markup (to test error handling).
    *   Known XSS payloads (from public databases).
    *   Randomly generated strings.
    *   Combinations of the above, with variations in encoding, nesting, and tag/attribute combinations.
2.  **Input Delivery:**  Feeding these input strings to `github/markup`'s rendering functions.
3.  **Output Monitoring:**  Examining the rendered HTML output for any signs of successful script injection.  This could involve:
    *   Using a headless browser to execute the rendered HTML and check for JavaScript execution (e.g., looking for `alert()` calls).
    *   Comparing the output against expected sanitized output.
    *   Using static analysis tools to scan the output for potentially dangerous HTML constructs.
4.  **Iteration:**  Refining the input generation based on the results, focusing on areas that seem to be more vulnerable.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Let's expand on the mitigation strategies, providing more specific guidance:

*   **1. Use the Latest Version:**  This is the most fundamental step.  Vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered and patched.  Use a dependency management system (e.g., Bundler for Ruby) to ensure you're using the latest versions of `github/markup`, `html-pipeline`, and all related gems.  Automate this process.

*   **2. Strict Sanitization (Configuration):**  This is the most critical mitigation.  Configure `html-pipeline`'s sanitizer with the *most restrictive* settings possible.  Here's a recommended approach:

    *   **Whitelist Tags:**  Allow *only* a minimal set of safe tags.  A good starting point might be: `a`, `abbr`, `b`, `blockquote`, `br`, `code`, `dd`, `del`, `details`, `div`, `dl`, `dt`, `em`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `hr`, `i`, `img`, `ins`, `kbd`, `li`, `ol`, `p`, `pre`, `q`, `samp`, `span`, `strike`, `strong`, `sub`, `summary`, `sup`, `table`, `tbody`, `td`, `th`, `thead`, `tr`, `ul`.  *Carefully* consider each tag and whether it's truly necessary.
    *   **Whitelist Attributes:**  For each allowed tag, allow *only* essential attributes.  For example:
        *   `a`:  `href` (with strict URL validation)
        *   `img`: `src` (with strict URL validation), `alt`, `width`, `height`
        *   `code`: `class` (for syntax highlighting, but validate the class name)
        *   `table`: `summary`
        *   `td`, `th`: `colspan`, `rowspan`
    *   **Disallow:**  Explicitly disallow:
        *   `script`, `style`, `object`, `embed`, `iframe`, `form`, `input`, `textarea`, `button`
        *   *All* event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, etc.)
        *   `style` attribute (use CSS classes instead)
        *   `javascript:` URLs
        *   Data URIs (unless absolutely necessary, and then with strict content type restrictions)
    *   **Protocol Whitelist:**  For `href` and `src` attributes, allow only specific protocols: `http`, `https`, `mailto`.
    *   **CSS Sanitization:** If you allow CSS classes, use a CSS sanitizer to ensure that the class definitions themselves don't contain malicious code.
    *   **Regularly Review:**  The whitelist should be reviewed and updated regularly, as new attack vectors are discovered.

*   **3. Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.  It allows you to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, significantly reducing the impact of XSS even if a vulnerability exists.

    *   **`script-src`:**  The most important directive for XSS.  Use `script-src 'self';` to allow scripts only from the same origin as the page.  This prevents inline scripts and scripts from external domains from executing.  Consider using a nonce or hash-based approach for any necessary inline scripts.
    *   **`object-src`:**  Set to `'none'` to prevent Flash and other plugins.
    *   **`style-src`:**  Control where stylesheets can be loaded from.
    *   **`img-src`:**  Control where images can be loaded from.
    *   **`frame-src` / `child-src`:** Control where iframes can be loaded from.
    *   **`connect-src`:** Control which origins the page can connect to via XHR, WebSockets, etc.
    *   **Report URI:**  Use the `report-uri` or `report-to` directive to receive reports of CSP violations, which can help you identify and fix vulnerabilities.

*   **4. Input Validation (Length Limits):**  Impose reasonable length limits on user input.  This can help prevent certain types of attacks that rely on very long strings.

*   **5. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on XSS vulnerabilities.  This should involve both automated tools and manual testing by security experts.

*   **6. Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Ensure that the output of `github/markup` is properly encoded for the context in which it's used.  For example, if the output is being inserted into an HTML attribute, it should be HTML-attribute encoded.  If it's being inserted into a JavaScript string, it should be JavaScript-string encoded.  This prevents attackers from breaking out of the intended context and injecting code.  However, this is *secondary* to proper sanitization; encoding should *never* be relied upon as the primary defense against XSS.

*   **7. Disable Raw HTML Directives:**  As mentioned earlier, ensure that any features that allow users to include raw HTML are disabled.

*   **8. Educate Developers:**  Ensure that all developers working with `github/markup` are aware of XSS vulnerabilities and the mitigation strategies.  Provide training and documentation.

*   **9. Monitor for Vulnerability Disclosures:**  Stay informed about any new vulnerabilities discovered in `github/markup`, `html-pipeline`, or related libraries.  Subscribe to security mailing lists and follow relevant security researchers.

* **10. HttpOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:** While not directly related to `github/markup`, setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies is crucial to mitigate the impact of XSS. `HttpOnly` prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, and `Secure` ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS.

## 5. Conclusion

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a serious threat when using libraries like `github/markup` that process user-supplied markup.  By understanding the attack vectors and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy, including strict sanitization, Content Security Policy, and regular security audits, the risk of XSS can be significantly reduced.  Continuous vigilance and staying up-to-date with the latest security best practices are essential for maintaining a secure application.
