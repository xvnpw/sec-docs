# Deep Analysis: Sanitization Bypass via Malicious Markup (github/markup)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Sanitization Bypass via Malicious Markup" attack surface, identify specific vulnerabilities within the `github/markup` library and its underlying sanitization mechanisms, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to move from general risk assessment to specific, testable hypotheses and remediation steps.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the sanitization process performed by `github/markup` and its dependencies.  It *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors against the application (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, etc.).
*   Vulnerabilities in the application's logic *outside* of the markup rendering process.
*   Network-level attacks.
*   Vulnerabilities in the web server or operating system.

The scope is specifically limited to how malicious markup can bypass the sanitization intended by `github/markup`.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a multi-pronged approach:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the source code of `github/markup` and its underlying sanitization library (e.g., `html-pipeline`, which it often uses, and the specific sanitizer it employs, like `sanitize`).  This includes:
    *   Identifying the specific sanitization library and version used.
    *   Analyzing the sanitization logic, whitelists, blacklists, and regular expressions used.
    *   Searching for known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the sanitizer.
    *   Looking for potential logic errors or edge cases in the sanitization process.

2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and bypass techniques related to HTML sanitization in general, and specifically for the identified sanitization library.  This includes:
    *   Consulting vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, Snyk, etc.).
    *   Reviewing security advisories and blog posts related to HTML sanitization bypasses.
    *   Examining past issues and pull requests in the `github/markup` and sanitizer repositories.

3.  **Fuzzing:** We will use fuzzing techniques to generate a large number of malformed and potentially malicious markup inputs and test them against the `github/markup` sanitization process.  This includes:
    *   Using a general-purpose fuzzer (e.g., `AFL++`, `libFuzzer`) or a specialized HTML fuzzer (e.g., `DOMPurify`'s test suite, adapted for `github/markup`).
    *   Creating custom fuzzing harnesses that integrate with `github/markup` and the application's rendering pipeline.
    *   Monitoring for crashes, unexpected behavior, and successful bypasses (where malicious HTML is rendered).

4.  **Mutation XSS (mXSS) Analysis:** We will specifically focus on mXSS vulnerabilities, given their prevalence and difficulty to detect.  This includes:
    *   Understanding the differences in how various browsers parse and mutate HTML.
    *   Crafting specific mXSS payloads designed to exploit these differences.
    *   Testing these payloads against `github/markup` in different browser environments.

5.  **Character Encoding Analysis:** We will investigate potential bypasses using character encoding tricks and Unicode homoglyphs. This includes:
    *   Identifying supported character encodings.
    *   Crafting payloads using unusual encodings (e.g., UTF-7, non-standard UTF-8 variations).
    *   Testing for homoglyph attacks (e.g., using visually similar characters to bypass blacklists).

6.  **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks by crafting specific, targeted payloads based on the findings of the previous steps.  This is a more focused form of testing than fuzzing.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1.  `github/markup` and Sanitization

`github/markup` itself is *not* a sanitizer. It's a library that selects the appropriate rendering engine (e.g., Markdown renderer, Textile renderer) based on the filename extension.  The actual sanitization is typically delegated to another library, most commonly `html-pipeline`, which in turn uses a sanitizer like `sanitize`.  Therefore, the *true* attack surface lies within the chosen sanitizer and its configuration.

**Key Questions:**

*   **Which sanitizer is used?**  Is it `sanitize` (most likely), `DOMPurify`, or something else?  The exact sanitizer *must* be identified.
*   **What version of the sanitizer is used?**  Vulnerabilities are often version-specific.
*   **How is the sanitizer configured?**  `github/markup` and `html-pipeline` allow for configuration of the sanitizer (e.g., whitelisting specific tags and attributes).  A restrictive configuration is crucial.  We need to see the *exact* configuration.
*   **Are there any custom filters or modifications to the sanitization process?**  The application might have added its own logic, which could introduce new vulnerabilities.

### 4.2.  Specific Vulnerability Areas

Based on the methodology, we will focus on these specific areas:

#### 4.2.1.  Mutation XSS (mXSS)

mXSS is a significant threat because it exploits the browser's own parsing and mutation behavior.  The sanitizer might see one thing, but the browser transforms it into something malicious.

**Example (Illustrative - May not work against a modern sanitizer):**

```html
<svg><animatetransform attributeName="transform" type="rotate" from="0 18 18" to="360 18 18" dur="1s" repeatCount="indefinite" additive="sum"><animate attributeName="transform" type="translate" values="0 0;0 200" dur="1s" repeatCount="indefinite" additive="sum"></svg>
```

This SVG might appear safe to a sanitizer, but browser parsing differences could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially execute JavaScript.

**Testing:**

*   We will use a combination of known mXSS payloads and fuzzing to generate variations.
*   We will test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to identify browser-specific vulnerabilities.
*   We will use tools like `DOMPurify`'s test suite as a starting point for mXSS payloads.

#### 4.2.2.  Character Encoding and Homoglyphs

Attackers can use unusual character encodings or visually similar characters (homoglyphs) to bypass blacklists or confuse the sanitizer.

**Example (Illustrative):**

*   Using UTF-7 encoding:  `+ADw-script+AD4-alert(1)+ADsAPA-/script+AD4-` (encodes `<script>alert(1);</script>`)
*   Using a homoglyph:  `<scrіpt>alert(1);</scrіpt>` (using a Cyrillic "і" instead of the Latin "i")

**Testing:**

*   We will create payloads using various character encodings (UTF-7, UTF-16, etc.).
*   We will use Unicode character tables to identify potential homoglyphs for common HTML tags and attributes.
*   We will test if the sanitizer correctly handles these encodings and homoglyphs.

#### 4.2.3.  Sanitizer-Specific Bugs

We will research known vulnerabilities in the specific sanitizer and version used by `github/markup`.  This is crucial, as even well-maintained sanitizers can have flaws.

**Example (Hypothetical, based on past `sanitize` vulnerabilities):**

*   A bug in how `sanitize` handles nested elements with specific attributes.
*   A regular expression vulnerability that allows bypassing attribute whitelists.

**Testing:**

*   We will consult vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, Snyk) for known issues.
*   We will review the sanitizer's changelog and issue tracker for past security fixes.
*   We will attempt to reproduce any known vulnerabilities in our environment.

#### 4.2.4.  Configuration Weaknesses

Even a strong sanitizer can be rendered ineffective by a weak configuration.

**Example:**

*   Allowing the `style` attribute without proper restrictions can lead to CSS-based attacks.
*   Allowing `<iframe>` tags without proper `sandbox` attributes can lead to phishing or clickjacking.
*   Allowing too many HTML tags in general increases the attack surface.

**Testing:**

*   We will review the `github/markup` and `html-pipeline` configuration to identify any overly permissive settings.
*   We will craft payloads that exploit these permissive settings.
*   We will recommend a more restrictive configuration based on the principle of least privilege.

### 4.3.  Fuzzing Strategy

Fuzzing is essential for discovering unknown vulnerabilities.

**Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Sanitization Entry Point:** Determine the exact function call in `github/markup` (or its underlying libraries) that performs the sanitization.
2.  **Create a Fuzzing Harness:** Write a small program that takes a string as input, passes it to the sanitization function, and checks the output.  This harness should:
    *   Handle crashes gracefully.
    *   Detect successful bypasses (e.g., by checking if the output contains known malicious patterns).
    *   Integrate with a fuzzer like `AFL++` or `libFuzzer`.
3.  **Generate Input Corpus:** Start with a small corpus of valid and slightly malformed HTML.
4.  **Run the Fuzzer:** Run the fuzzer for an extended period (hours or days), monitoring for crashes and bypasses.
5.  **Analyze Results:** Investigate any crashes or bypasses to determine the root cause and develop a fix.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Beyond the high-level mitigations, we need specific, actionable steps:

1.  **Identify and Update the Sanitizer:**  Pin the *exact* version of the sanitizer (e.g., `sanitize` version `x.y.z`) and ensure it's the latest *stable* release.  Set up automated dependency updates (e.g., using Dependabot).

2.  **Restrictive Configuration:**  Provide a concrete example of a safe and restrictive configuration for the sanitizer.  For example, if using `sanitize`, this might look like:

    ```ruby
    Sanitize::Config.merge(
      Sanitize::Config::RELAXED,
      elements: %w[
        a abbr b blockquote br cite code dd dfn dl dt em h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 i
        img li ol p pre q small strike strong sub sup time u ul
      ],
      attributes: {
        'a' => ['href', 'title', 'rel'],
        'img' => ['src', 'alt', 'title', 'width', 'height'],
      },
      protocols: {
        'a' => {'href' => ['http', 'https', 'mailto', :relative]},
      },
      transformers: [
        # Example: Remove any 'style' attributes
        lambda { |env|
          node      = env[:node]
          node_name = env[:node_name]

          if node.has_attribute?('style')
            node.remove_attribute('style')
          end
        }
      ],
      remove_contents: ['script', 'style', 'iframe', 'object', 'embed']
    )
    ```
    This is just an *example*; the specific configuration must be tailored to the application's needs.  The key is to allow *only* what is absolutely necessary.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a *strict* CSP.  This is a crucial second layer of defense.  A good starting point is:

    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:;
    ```

    This CSP disallows inline scripts, external scripts, and external stylesheets.  It allows images from the same origin and data URIs (which might be needed for some Markdown rendering).  This CSP *must* be carefully tested and adjusted for the specific application.  It's likely that some resources will need to be whitelisted.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing, specifically targeting the markup sanitization process.

5.  **Input Validation (Before Sanitization):** While sanitization is the primary defense, consider adding input validation *before* the sanitizer. This can help reject obviously malicious input early, reducing the load on the sanitizer and potentially preventing some attacks. This is *not* a replacement for sanitization.

6.  **Output Encoding (After Sanitization):**  Even with perfect sanitization, ensure that the output is properly encoded for the context in which it's used (e.g., HTML encoding). This prevents any remaining HTML from being interpreted as code.

7. **Monitor for Sanitizer Bypasses:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect potential sanitizer bypass attempts. This could involve looking for unusual characters, long strings, or patterns that match known exploit payloads.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Sanitization Bypass via Malicious Markup" attack surface is a critical area of concern for any application using `github/markup`.  By combining code review, vulnerability research, fuzzing, and rigorous testing, we can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.  A multi-layered approach, including a well-vetted and updated sanitizer, a restrictive configuration, a strong CSP, and regular security audits, is essential for protecting the application and its users. The key takeaway is to treat `github/markup` not as a sanitizer itself, but as a component that *relies* on a separate, robust sanitization library, and to focus security efforts on that library and its configuration.
