## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application via Markup (Attacker Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_via_markup__attacker_goal_.md)

This is the attacker's primary goal, representing the most severe compromise. Success here allows the attacker to control the server and potentially access all data and resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Execute Arbitrary Code on Server](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__execute_arbitrary_code_on_server.md)

*   This is the attacker's primary goal, representing the most severe compromise. Success here allows the attacker to control the server and potentially access all data and resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This critical node represents the exploitation of flaws in the code that parses the markup language.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Logic Errors in Parser](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_logic_errors_in_parser.md)

        *   Attackers can craft specific markup that causes the parser to enter an unexpected state, potentially leading to code execution. This requires a deep understanding of the parser's internal logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

        *   Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the libraries used by `github/markup` (e.g., CommonMark, Redcarpet). This is often easier if an exploit is readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   If the application uses a server-side templating engine and directly uses the output of `github/markup` without proper escaping, attackers can inject template directives within the markup. These directives can then be executed by the templating engine, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Include Malicious Remote Files](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__include_malicious_remote_files.md)

*   If `github/markup` or the underlying libraries allow including external resources via URLs, attackers can provide URLs pointing to malicious scripts. When the markup is processed, these scripts can be fetched and executed on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Gain Access to Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__gain_access_to_sensitive_data.md)

*   This is another key attacker goal, focusing on obtaining confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   This critical node represents the injection of malicious scripts into the rendered HTML output.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_javascript_via_markup.md)

        *   Attackers leverage markup features to embed JavaScript code (e.g., using `<script>` tags or event handlers). When a user views the rendered content, this malicious script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or redirect the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Include Remote Files with Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__include_remote_files_with_sensitive_information.md)

*   Similar to the code execution scenario, if remote file inclusion is allowed, attackers can provide URLs pointing to files containing sensitive data. When the markup is processed, the content of these remote files can be included, potentially exposing confidential information.
