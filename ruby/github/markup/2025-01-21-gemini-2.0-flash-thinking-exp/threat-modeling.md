# Threat Model Analysis for github/markup

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** A malicious user crafts markup containing embedded JavaScript code. This markup is processed by `github/markup` and the resulting HTML includes the malicious script. When a victim views this content in their browser, the script executes.
    * **How:** The attacker might inject `<script>` tags, event handlers (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`), or use data URIs containing JavaScript that `github/markup` fails to sanitize or escape.
    * **Impact:**
        * The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser within the context of the application. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and other client-side attacks.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Potentially affects the **HTML generation module** within `github/markup`, specifically the parts responsible for rendering elements like code blocks, inline code, or handling specific markup language features that allow script injection.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Ensure the application properly encodes the HTML output generated by `github/markup` before rendering it in the browser. Use appropriate escaping functions for HTML content.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and disallows inline scripts.
        * **Regularly Update `github/markup`:** Keep the library updated to benefit from security patches that address known XSS vulnerabilities.
        * **Consider Additional Sanitization:** While `github/markup` performs some sanitization, consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library on the output for an extra layer of defense.

## Threat: [HTML Injection](./threats/html_injection.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** A malicious user injects arbitrary HTML tags into the markup. `github/markup` processes this markup and includes the malicious HTML in its output.
    * **How:** The attacker might inject tags like `<iframe>`, `<form>`, or `<div>` with malicious attributes that `github/markup` does not sanitize or escape. This can be used to overlay content, create fake login forms, or redirect users.
    * **Impact:**
        * Can lead to phishing attacks by displaying fake login forms, defacement of the application's UI, or embedding malicious content from external sources.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Primarily affects the **HTML generation module** within `github/markup`, specifically how it handles and renders various HTML tags based on the input markup.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Contextual Output Encoding:**  Properly encode HTML entities in the output generated by `github/markup` to prevent the browser from interpreting injected HTML tags.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for script injection, CSP can also help mitigate HTML injection by restricting the sources of frame ancestors and other resources.
        * **Careful Handling of User-Provided Attributes:** If the application allows users to specify attributes within markup that are passed through `github/markup`, ensure these are validated and sanitized *before* being processed by the library.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resources](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_resources.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** If the markup language allows embedding external resources (e.g., images, iframes) via URLs, an attacker can manipulate these URLs to target internal resources or external services. `github/markup` processes these URLs and attempts to fetch the resources.
    * **How:** The attacker might provide URLs pointing to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other sensitive services that `github/markup` attempts to access.
    * **Impact:**
        * Can lead to information disclosure about internal network infrastructure, access to internal services, or abuse of external services.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Affects the **resource loading or processing components** within `github/markup` that handle external URLs, potentially within specific language handlers (e.g., Markdown image handling).
    * **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the application's internal network and services)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **URL Whitelisting:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for external resources *before* passing the markup to `github/markup`.
        * **Disable External Resource Loading:** If not strictly necessary, configure the application or `github/markup` (if configurable) to disallow the embedding of external resources.
        * **Proxy External Requests:** If external resources are required, proxy the requests through a controlled server that can enforce security policies and prevent access to internal networks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** A malicious user crafts markup with deeply nested structures, excessively large elements, or computationally expensive patterns that cause the `github/markup` library to consume excessive CPU or memory resources *during its processing*.
    * **How:** The attacker might create a Markdown document with thousands of nested lists, extremely long code blocks, or complex regular expressions that trigger inefficient parsing within `github/markup`.
    * **Impact:**
        * Can lead to temporary unavailability of the application, performance degradation, or even server crashes due to the resource exhaustion caused by `github/markup`.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Affects the **parsing and rendering engine** of `github/markup`, particularly the components responsible for handling complex or large input. This could be within the core parser or specific language handlers.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Medium**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of the markup input that can be processed *before* passing it to `github/markup`.
        * **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for the `github/markup` processing to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources (CPU, memory) and implement alerts for unusual spikes during markup processing.
