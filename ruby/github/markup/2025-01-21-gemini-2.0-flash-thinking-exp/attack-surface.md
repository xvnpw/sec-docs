# Attack Surface Analysis for github/markup

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_html_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTML, including JavaScript, directly into markup content. When `github/markup` renders this content, the malicious scripts execute in the user's browser.
    *   **How Markup Contributes:** The library's core function is to translate markup into HTML. If the input markup inherently contains HTML tags with malicious attributes (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`) or `<script>` tags, `github/markup` will faithfully render them, leading to script execution.
    *   **Example:**
        ```markdown
        This is some text. <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS!')">
        ```
        or
        ```markdown
        <script>alert('XSS!');</script>
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and potentially access to sensitive data or actions within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust output encoding/escaping of the HTML generated by `github/markup` before rendering it in the browser. This prevents the browser from interpreting injected HTML as executable code.
            *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
            *   Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library *after* `github/markup` processing to remove potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes. Be cautious, as overly aggressive sanitization can break legitimate markup.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft markup that, when processed by `github/markup` or its underlying markup processors, consumes excessive CPU or memory resources, leading to application slowdown or failure.
    *   **How Markup Contributes:** Certain markup structures can be computationally expensive to parse or render. Deeply nested elements, excessively long lines, or complex regular expressions (depending on the underlying processor) within the markup can trigger this.
    *   **Example:**
        ```markdown
        [a]([b]([c]([d]([e]([f]([g]([h]([i]([j](very long URL)))))))))))
        ```
        or a very long string of the same character in Textile.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance, potential server crashes, impacting all users of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement timeouts for markup processing to prevent indefinitely long operations.
            *   Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for the processes handling markup rendering.
            *   Consider using a more robust and performant markup processor if the default ones are prone to DoS.
            *   Implement rate limiting or input size restrictions on user-provided markup.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Input Sanitization/Filtering](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_input_sanitizationfiltering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft markup that circumvents sanitization or filtering mechanisms implemented *before* the content is passed to `github/markup`, allowing malicious content to be rendered.
    *   **How Markup Contributes:**  Variations in markup syntax or less common features might not be accounted for by the sanitization logic, but are still correctly processed by `github/markup`. The structure or specific tags within the markup are the key to bypassing the filters.
    *   **Example:** An application might filter `<script>` tags but not `<svg>` tags, which can also execute JavaScript.
        ```markdown
        <svg onload=alert("XSS")></svg>
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Successful injection of malicious content, potentially leading to XSS or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Sanitize the HTML output *after* `github/markup` processing, as this is the final output that will be rendered in the browser.
            *   Ensure sanitization logic is comprehensive and covers a wide range of potential attack vectors, including less common HTML tags and attributes.
            *   Employ a "whitelist" approach to sanitization, allowing only known safe HTML elements and attributes, rather than trying to block all potentially dangerous ones (which is harder to maintain).
            *   Regularly review and update sanitization rules to address new attack vectors.
