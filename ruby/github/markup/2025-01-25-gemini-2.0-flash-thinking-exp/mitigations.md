# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for github/markup

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Markup-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__markup-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Output Sanitization (Markup-Focused)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Language Whitelisting via `github/markup` Configuration:**
        *   Identify the *minimum* set of markup languages required for your application's functionality.
        *   Configure `github/markup` to *only* enable support for these whitelisted languages.  This directly reduces the attack surface by disabling parsers for less commonly used or potentially more complex markup formats.
        *   Refer to `github/markup`'s documentation or configuration options to understand how to disable specific markup language parsers. This might involve modifying the library's initialization or using specific options when invoking the markup rendering function.
        *   For example, if your application *only* needs Markdown, explicitly disable support for Textile, RDoc, MediaWiki, Org, Creole, and Pod formats within `github/markup`'s configuration.
    2.  **Output Sanitization of `github/markup`'s HTML Output:**
        *   After `github/markup` processes the input and generates HTML, *always* sanitize this HTML output before displaying it to users. This is critical because `github/markup` itself focuses on *rendering* markup, not *securing* the resulting HTML.
        *   Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library (e.g., `Sanitize` in Ruby, `DOMPurify` in JavaScript) specifically designed to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes.
        *   Configure the sanitization library with a strict whitelist approach tailored to the expected output of `github/markup` and the needs of your application.
            *   **Focus on Sanitizing HTML Tags and Attributes Generated by `github/markup`:** Understand the HTML structure that `github/markup` produces for the markup languages you are using.  Ensure your sanitization rules are effective against the *specific* HTML output patterns of `github/markup`.
            *   **Example Sanitization Rules (Illustrative - Adapt to your needs):**
                *   **Allowed Tags:** `p`, `em`, `strong`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `a`, `img`, `code`, `pre`, `blockquote`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `br`, `hr`, `div`, `span`. (Adjust this list based on the markup features you use and the HTML they generate).
                *   **Allowed Attributes:** For `<a>`: `href`, `title`, `rel`; for `<img>`: `src`, `alt`, `title`; for other tags, limit attributes to safe, non-event-handling attributes like `class`, `id`, `title` (if needed).  *Crucially, sanitize URL attributes like `href` and `src` to prevent `javascript:` URLs.*
                *   **Remove Dangerous Tags:**  Aggressively remove tags like `<script>`, `<style>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>`, `<form>`, `<base>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<svg>`, `<math>` that are *not* expected to be generated by `github/markup` in your use case, or are inherently dangerous.
                *   **Remove Dangerous Attributes:** Remove all event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onerror`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, etc.) as `github/markup` should not be generating these, and they are common XSS vectors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Malicious markup, when processed by `github/markup` and not properly sanitized, can result in HTML containing embedded JavaScript. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in users' browsers.
    *   **HTML Injection - Medium Severity:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML structures through markup, leading to page defacement, phishing attempts, or misleading content.
    *   **Parser Exploits (Indirect Mitigation) - High Severity (Potentially):** While sanitization doesn't prevent parser exploits in `github/markup` itself, it can neutralize the *output* of such exploits if they result in the generation of malicious HTML. Language whitelisting reduces the attack surface by limiting the parsers involved.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Significantly reduces XSS risk by preventing malicious JavaScript from being rendered and executed in the browser. Effective sanitization is paramount.
    *   **HTML Injection:**  Effectively mitigates HTML injection by removing or neutralizing dangerous HTML tags and attributes in the output of `github/markup`.
    *   **Parser Exploits:** Provides a layer of defense against the *consequences* of parser exploits by sanitizing the HTML output, even if a parser vulnerability is triggered within `github/markup`. Language whitelisting reduces the number of parsers that could potentially have vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Output Sanitization:** Client-side sanitization using `DOMPurify` is implemented, configured with a moderately restrictive whitelist. This sanitizes the HTML *after* `github/markup` has rendered it.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Language Whitelisting in `github/markup`:**  Currently, all markup languages supported by `github/markup` are likely enabled by default. Explicitly configuring `github/markup` to only support the necessary languages is missing.  This would require investigating `github/markup`'s configuration options and implementing the necessary changes.
    *   **Backend Sanitization (Redundancy):** Sanitization is only client-side. Implementing backend sanitization *in addition* to client-side sanitization would provide a crucial second layer of defense, especially if client-side sanitization is bypassed or disabled. This would involve sanitizing the HTML output of `github/markup` on the server before sending it to the client.
