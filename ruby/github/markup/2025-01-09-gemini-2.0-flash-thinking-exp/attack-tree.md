## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Markup Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_markup_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to exploit weaknesses in the `github/markup` library's code that handles the parsing of different markup languages. By providing specially crafted, potentially malformed markup, the attacker attempts to trigger unexpected behavior in the parser.
    *   **Focus:** This path targets the core functionality of the library itself. If successful, it can bypass higher-level application security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Supply Malicious Markup](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__supply_malicious_markup.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the foundational step for many markup-related attacks. The attacker needs to introduce malicious markup into the application's processing pipeline. This can be done through various means, including user input fields, data stored in databases, or files uploaded to the server.
    *   **Focus:**  Preventing the introduction of malicious markup is a primary defensive strategy.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Trigger Parsing Error Leading to Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__trigger_parsing_error_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a direct exploitation of vulnerabilities within the parser.
        *   **Buffer Overflow in Parser:** The attacker provides input that exceeds the allocated buffer size in the parser, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Integer Overflow in Parser:** The attacker crafts input that causes an integer variable within the parser to exceed its maximum value, leading to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, and potentially code execution.
        *   **Logic Error Leading to Unintended Code Execution:** The attacker exploits flaws in the parser's logic or state management to force it into an unintended state where it executes attacker-controlled code.
    *   **Focus:** These are severe vulnerabilities that can grant the attacker complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious HTML Through Markup](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__inject_malicious_html_through_markup.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages the features of the markup language to generate malicious HTML code in the final output. This HTML is then rendered by the user's browser, leading to client-side attacks.
    *   **Focus:** This highlights the risk of allowing untrusted content to be converted into executable HTML.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Supply Markup Designed to Generate Malicious HTML](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__supply_markup_designed_to_generate_malicious_html.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts markup specifically intended to produce harmful HTML when processed by `github/markup`. This often involves using allowed HTML tags or exploiting markup syntax to inject raw HTML.
    *   **Focus:** Understanding how different markup features can be abused is crucial for prevention.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Allowed HTML Tags/Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_allowed_html_tagsattributes.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uses legitimate HTML tags and attributes supported by the markup language to inject malicious code.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] `<script>` Tag Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) [CRITICAL]:** The attacker injects `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript code. This code executes in the user's browser within the context of the application's domain, allowing for actions like session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement.
        *   **Event Handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) Injection [CRITICAL]:** The attacker injects HTML tags with malicious JavaScript code embedded within event handlers. These handlers execute when the corresponding event occurs (e.g., an image fails to load).
    *   **Focus:** This emphasizes the danger of allowing any HTML without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [<script> Tag Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/script_tag_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss___critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript code. This code executes in the user's browser within the context of the application's domain, allowing for actions like session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement.
    *   **Focus:** This emphasizes the danger of allowing any HTML without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Event Handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/event_handlers__e_g____onload____onerror___injection__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects HTML tags with malicious JavaScript code embedded within event handlers. These handlers execute when the corresponding event occurs (e.g., an image fails to load).
    *   **Focus:** This emphasizes the danger of allowing any HTML without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markup Syntax to Inject Raw HTML](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markup_syntax_to_inject_raw_html.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Some markup languages allow embedding raw HTML within the markup. Attackers can exploit this feature if the application doesn't properly sanitize the output.
        *   **Misuse of Markdown Features Allowing Raw HTML [CRITICAL]:**  Attackers leverage Markdown syntax that permits the inclusion of raw HTML tags.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Markup-Specific Syntax Handling [CRITICAL]:**  Attackers exploit bugs or inconsistencies in how `github/markup` handles specific markup syntax to inject unintended raw HTML.
    *   **Focus:**  Highlights the risks associated with features that allow bypassing the markup processing layer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of Markdown Features Allowing Raw HTML [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_markdown_features_allowing_raw_html__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers leverage Markdown syntax that permits the inclusion of raw HTML tags.
    *   **Focus:**  Highlights the risks associated with features that allow bypassing the markup processing layer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Markup-Specific Syntax Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_markup-specific_syntax_handling__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit bugs or inconsistencies in how `github/markup` handles specific markup syntax to inject unintended raw HTML.
    *   **Focus:**  Highlights the risks associated with features that allow bypassing the markup processing layer.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Application Renders Generated HTML Without Proper Sanitization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__application_renders_generated_html_without_proper_sanitization__cri_189982ec.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the critical failure point where the application takes the HTML generated by `github/markup` and directly renders it in the user's browser without any sanitization or encoding. This allows any malicious HTML injected through the markup to execute.
    *   **Focus:** This is the most important mitigation point for preventing HTML injection attacks. Proper output encoding is paramount.
