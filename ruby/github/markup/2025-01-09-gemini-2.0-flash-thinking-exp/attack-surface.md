# Attack Surface Analysis for github/markup

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** Malicious users can inject client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the rendered HTML output, which then executes in other users' browsers.

**How Markup Contributes:**  `github/markup`'s primary function is to convert markup languages into HTML. If the parsing or rendering process doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided markup, it can allow the inclusion of arbitrary HTML tags and JavaScript.

**Example:** A user submits Markdown containing `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`. If not sanitized, `github/markup` renders this directly into the HTML, causing the alert to execute in a visitor's browser.

**Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Output Encoding/Escaping: Ensure all rendered HTML output is properly encoded or escaped before being displayed in the browser.
* Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load.
* Regularly Update `github/markup`: Keep the library updated to benefit from security patches.
* Consider a Dedicated Sanitization Library: Use a robust HTML sanitization library after rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application to make unintended requests to internal or external resources on the server's behalf.

**How Markup Contributes:** Some markup languages allow embedding or linking to external resources (e.g., images, iframes). If `github/markup` processes these without proper validation, an attacker can control the destination of these requests.

**Example:** A user submits Markdown containing `![alt text](http://internal.server/sensitive-data)`. If the application directly fetches and displays this "image" without validation, it could expose internal resources.

**Impact:** Access to internal services, data exfiltration, port scanning of internal networks.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* URL Whitelisting/Validation: Implement strict whitelisting of allowed URL schemes and domains.
* Disable Remote Content Features (If Possible): Consider disabling features that allow embedding remote content.
* Use a Proxy for External Requests: Use a proxy service to enforce security policies.
* Network Segmentation: Properly segment the network.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker can submit specially crafted markup that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory) during the parsing or rendering process.

**How Markup Contributes:** Certain markup structures or large input sizes can be computationally expensive for the underlying parsing engines used by `github/markup`.

**Example:** A user submits Markdown with extremely deeply nested lists or a very large file, causing excessive resource consumption.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Input Size Limits: Implement limits on the size of the markup input.
* Parsing Timeouts: Set timeouts for the markup parsing process.
* Resource Limits (e.g., cgroups): Use operating system-level resource limits.
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for markup requests.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Parsing Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_parsing_libraries.md)

**Description:** `github/markup` relies on various external libraries to parse different markup languages. Vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact the security of the application.

**How Markup Contributes:** `github/markup` acts as a wrapper around these libraries, and any security flaws in them can be exploited through the `github/markup` interface when processing specific markup.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the Redcarpet library (for Markdown) allowing for arbitrary code execution could be triggered by processing malicious Markdown through `github/markup`.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, and DoS.

**Risk Severity:** Varies from **High** to **Critical** depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep `github/markup` and its underlying parsing libraries updated.
* Monitor Security Advisories: Subscribe to security advisories for the libraries used by `github/markup`.
* Dependency Scanning: Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
