# Threat Model Analysis for github/markup

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markup](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markup.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts within the user-provided markup. When `github/markup` renders this markup into HTML, the script is included and executed in the context of another user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf. This threat directly arises from `github/markup`'s handling (or lack thereof) of potentially dangerous HTML constructs within the input markup.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, malware distribution.
*   **Affected Component:** `github/markup` core rendering logic, specifically the sanitization or escaping routines (or lack thereof) for HTML elements generated from various markup languages. This involves the main `Markup` class and the specific parser implementations it utilizes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict HTML sanitization on the output of `github/markup` before rendering it in the user's browser. Utilize a well-vetted HTML sanitization library. Employ a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS. Regularly update `github/markup` to benefit from potential security fixes.

## Threat: [HTML Injection Leading to UI Redress/Clickjacking](./threats/html_injection_leading_to_ui_redressclickjacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML structures within the markup that, while not directly executing scripts, can manipulate the page's layout in a way that tricks users into performing unintended actions. This threat is directly related to how `github/markup` renders HTML tags and attributes that can influence the layout.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed by the user unknowingly, such as transferring funds, changing settings, or revealing sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** `github/markup` core rendering logic, specifically the handling of HTML tags and attributes that can affect the layout and structure of the rendered page.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict HTML sanitization to remove or neutralize HTML elements that can be used for layout manipulation. Use frame busting techniques or the `X-Frame-Options` header if the content is not intended to be framed.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Markup Parsers](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_markup_parsers.md)

*   **Description:** `github/markup` relies on various underlying libraries for parsing different markup languages (e.g., CommonMark for Markdown, Redcarpet). Vulnerabilities in these underlying parsers (e.g., buffer overflows, parsing errors) can be exploited through crafted markup processed by `github/markup`. This threat directly involves `github/markup` as it is the entry point for processing the potentially malicious markup.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server (in severe cases), denial of service, unexpected application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific underlying parser libraries used by `github/markup` for different markup languages. The `github/markup` library acts as an intermediary, passing the input to these parsers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update `github/markup` and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in the underlying parsers. Monitor security advisories for the used parser libraries.
