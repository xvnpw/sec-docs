While not directly executing scripts (like XSS), this injected HTML manipulates the page's layout to trick users into performing unintended actions. This leverages how `github/markup` renders HTML tags and attributes that influence the layout and stacking of elements.\n")

        print("    * **Attribute Sanitization:** Carefully sanitize attributes, especially those related to styling (`style`), events (`onclick`, `onmouseover`), and URLs (`href`, `src`). Remove or neutralize potentially dangerous values.\n")
        print("    * **Utilize Robust Sanitization Libraries:** Leverage well-established and actively maintained HTML sanitization libraries like **DOMPurify** (server-side version if available for the language `github/markup` is written in, or a suitable alternative like Bleach in Python). These libraries are specifically designed to prevent various injection attacks.\n")
        print("    * **Regular Updates:** Ensure the sanitization library is kept up-to-date to address newly discovered bypasses and vulnerabilities.\n")
        print("* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**\n")
        print("    * **`frame-ancestors` Directive:** Use the `frame-ancestors` directive in the CSP header to control which domains are allowed to embed the application's content in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>` elements. Setting this to `'self'` prevents embedding from other origins, mitigating many clickjacking scenarios.\n")
        print("    * **Consider other CSP directives:** While not directly preventing HTML injection, other directives can help mitigate the impact of successful attacks.\n")
        print("* **`X-Frame-Options` Header:**\n")
        print("    * **`DENY`:** This is the most restrictive option and prevents the page from being framed at all, regardless of the origin.\n")

        print("    * **Implementation:** Ensure the `X-Frame-Options` header is correctly configured on the server serving the content.\n")
        print("* **UI/UX Design Considerations:**\n")
        print("    * **Clear Visual Cues:** Design interactive elements with clear visual boundaries and labels, making it difficult for attackers to overlay them convincingly.\n")
        print("    * **Avoid Transparent or Invisible Elements:** Minimize the use of transparent or invisible elements that could be exploited for clickjacking.\n")
        print("    * **Confirmation Steps:** For critical actions (e.g., financial transactions, account deletion), implement confirmation steps that require explicit user interaction and verification.\n")
        print("    * **Distinct Interactive Areas:** Ensure interactive elements are sufficiently spaced apart to reduce the likelihood of accidental clicks on overlaid elements.\n")
        print("* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**\n")
        print("    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `github/markup` rendering logic and its integration within the application.\n")

        print("* **Developer Training and Awareness:**\n")
        print("    * **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with HTML injection and clickjacking and understand secure coding practices.\n")
        print("    * **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines that address input validation, output encoding, and proper use of sanitization libraries.\n")
