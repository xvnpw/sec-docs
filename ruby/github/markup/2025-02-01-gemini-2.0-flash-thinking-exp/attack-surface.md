# Attack Surface Analysis for github/markup

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markup Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markup_injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into rendered HTML output by exploiting vulnerabilities in markup parsing or sanitization processes.
**Markup Contribution:** `github/markup`'s core function is to process and render user-provided markup. If the underlying rendering engines or the application using `github/markup` fail to properly sanitize this markup, it becomes a direct vector for injecting malicious scripts. The library's purpose inherently involves handling potentially untrusted markup content.
**Example:** A user submits Markdown containing: `` `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>` ``. If the Markdown renderer doesn't sanitize `javascript:` URLs in `href` attributes, clicking the link in the rendered HTML will execute JavaScript.
**Impact:** User account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
**Risk Severity:** **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Robust Output Sanitization:**  Implement strict HTML sanitization on the output *after* `github/markup` rendering within the application. Utilize well-established sanitization libraries appropriate for the application's language and framework.
*   **Choose Secure Rendering Engines:** Select rendering engines known for their strong security track record and active maintenance, including timely security patching.
*   **Configure Rendering Engines for Security:**  Enable and rigorously configure HTML sanitization options provided by the chosen rendering engines to be as restrictive as possible, minimizing the potential for bypasses.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks, even if they manage to occur, by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Markup](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_complex_markup.md)

**Description:**  Submitting specially crafted, computationally intensive markup designed to exhaust server resources, leading to application unavailability or performance degradation.
**Markup Contribution:** `github/markup` relies on external parsers to process various markup languages.  Intricately nested or excessively complex markup structures can cause these parsers to consume disproportionate CPU and memory resources, especially if the rendering engines are not specifically designed to handle DoS resilience. The library's flexibility in supporting diverse markup formats increases the potential for encountering parsers with varying performance characteristics.
**Example:** A user submits a Markdown document containing an extremely long sequence of repetitive characters within a code block or a deeply nested series of lists. Parsing such a structure can lead to excessive CPU usage and memory allocation, potentially causing the server to become unresponsive.
**Impact:** Application downtime, slow response times, server crashes, and service disruption, impacting availability for legitimate users.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation and Complexity Limits:**  Implement validation to restrict the size and structural complexity of submitted markup. Reject markup that exceeds predefined limits on length, nesting depth, or other complexity metrics before it is processed by `github/markup`.
*   **Rendering Timeouts:**  Set reasonable timeouts for the markup rendering process. If rendering exceeds the timeout, terminate the process to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure responsiveness.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of markup rendering requests from a single user or IP address within a given timeframe, mitigating attempts to flood the server with DoS-inducing markup.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Continuously monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.) and establish alerts to promptly detect unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack in progress.
*   **Choose Performant Rendering Engines:**  Prioritize the selection of rendering engines known for their performance and efficiency in handling a wide range of markup structures, including potentially complex or malformed input, to minimize resource consumption during parsing.
