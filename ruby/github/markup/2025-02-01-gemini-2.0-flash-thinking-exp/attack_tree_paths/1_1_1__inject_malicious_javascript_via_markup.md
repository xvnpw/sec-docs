## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "1.1.1. Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup" within the context of applications utilizing the `github/markup` library (https://github.com/github/markup). This analysis aims to understand the potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies associated with this specific attack path.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the possibility of injecting malicious JavaScript code into content processed by GitHub Markup.  We aim to:

*   **Identify potential vulnerabilities:**  Pinpoint weaknesses in how `github/markup` processes and sanitizes various markup formats that could be exploited to inject JavaScript.
*   **Analyze attack vectors:**  Examine specific techniques attackers might employ to inject JavaScript, focusing on the provided attack vectors: `<script>` tag injection, event handler injection, and HTML5 payloads.
*   **Assess the impact:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of successful JavaScript injection, considering the context of applications using `github/markup`.
*   **Recommend mitigation strategies:**  Propose actionable steps for development teams to prevent or mitigate JavaScript injection vulnerabilities when using `github/markup`.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically scoped to the attack path:

**1.1.1. Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup**

And its immediate sub-nodes representing attack vectors:

*   **`<script>` Tag Injection:** Attempts to directly embed JavaScript code within `<script>` tags in the markup input.
*   **Event Handler Injection:**  Exploiting HTML attributes that can execute JavaScript code, such as `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, etc., within markup tags.
*   **HTML5 Payloads:** Utilizing newer HTML5 features and tags that might offer avenues for JavaScript execution, potentially bypassing traditional sanitization methods.

This analysis will focus on the interaction between user-supplied markup, the `github/markup` library's processing, and the final rendering of the content in a web browser. We will consider the different markup formats supported by `github/markup` (e.g., Markdown, Textile, AsciiDoc, etc.) and how they are handled.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Analysis of vulnerabilities outside of JavaScript injection via markup.
*   Detailed code review of the `github/markup` library itself (we will treat it as a black box for vulnerability analysis, focusing on its behavior).
*   Specific application-level vulnerabilities beyond the scope of markup processing.
*   Denial-of-service attacks related to markup processing.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Markup Format Review:**  Examine the different markup formats supported by `github/markup` and how they are typically parsed and rendered into HTML. This will help identify potential areas where JavaScript injection might be possible.
2.  **Attack Vector Simulation:**  For each attack vector, we will simulate potential injection attempts using various markup formats and analyze how `github/markup` processes them. This will involve:
    *   Crafting example payloads for each attack vector.
    *   Hypothesizing how `github/markup` might handle these payloads based on common sanitization practices.
    *   (Ideally, if practical and safe within a controlled environment) Testing these payloads against a setup using `github/markup` to observe the actual behavior.
3.  **Sanitization Analysis (Conceptual):**  Based on common security practices for markup processing, we will conceptually analyze the sanitization mechanisms that `github/markup` likely employs. We will consider common bypass techniques and how they might apply to these mechanisms.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful JavaScript injection attacks in the context of applications using `github/markup`. This includes considering the types of data and actions that could be compromised.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors, we will propose mitigation strategies that development teams can implement to enhance the security of their applications using `github/markup`. These strategies will focus on secure configuration, input validation, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup

This section delves into each attack vector under the "Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup" path.

#### 4.1. `<script>` Tag Injection

*   **Description:** This is the most straightforward and commonly attempted method of JavaScript injection. Attackers try to directly embed JavaScript code within `<script>` tags in the markup input.

*   **How it Works:**  If `github/markup` or the rendering application naively processes markup without proper sanitization, it might directly pass `<script>` tags into the rendered HTML. Browsers will then execute any JavaScript code within these tags.

*   **GitHub Markup Context:**  Reputable markup processors like `github/markup` are expected to have robust sanitization mechanisms to prevent direct `<script>` tag injection.  They typically employ HTML sanitizers that remove or neutralize `<script>` tags.

*   **Potential Bypass Scenarios (Less Likely with `github/markup`, but worth considering in general):**
    *   **Case Sensitivity Issues:**  Exploiting case sensitivity vulnerabilities in sanitization rules (e.g., `<SCRIPT>`, `<Script>`).  However, modern sanitizers are usually case-insensitive.
    *   **Whitespace/Newline Bypass:**  Injecting whitespace or newlines within the `<script>` tag to confuse simple regex-based sanitizers (e.g., `<scri pt>`).  More sophisticated parsers are less susceptible to this.
    *   **Encoding Bypass:**  Using HTML entities or URL encoding to represent `<script>` tags in a way that might bypass basic filters but still be interpreted by the browser after decoding. (e.g., `&lt;script&gt;`).  Good sanitizers should decode entities before sanitization.

*   **Example Payloads:**
    ```markdown
    This is some text. <script>alert('XSS via <script> tag!');</script> And more text.
    ```
    ```markdown
    This is some text. <SCRIPT>alert('XSS via <SCRIPT> tag!');</SCRIPT> And more text.
    ```
    ```markdown
    This is some text. <scri pt>alert('XSS via <scri pt> tag!');</scri pt> And more text.
    ```

*   **Mitigation within GitHub Markup and Applications:**
    *   **Robust HTML Sanitization:** `github/markup` must employ a strong HTML sanitizer (like `Sanitize` gem used by GitHub) that effectively removes or neutralizes `<script>` tags and their content.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Applications using `github/markup` should implement a strict CSP that restricts the execution of inline JavaScript. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure even if sanitization fails.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review and update the sanitization library and configurations to address new bypass techniques.

#### 4.2. Event Handler Injection

*   **Description:**  Instead of directly using `<script>` tags, attackers can inject JavaScript code through HTML attributes that are designed to handle events. Common examples include `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, etc.

*   **How it Works:**  If markup processing allows these event handler attributes to be rendered in the HTML output without proper sanitization, attackers can inject JavaScript code directly into the attribute value. When the event is triggered in the browser (e.g., an image loads, a user clicks an element), the injected JavaScript code will execute.

*   **GitHub Markup Context:**  `github/markup` should sanitize HTML attributes, including event handlers, to prevent JavaScript injection.  A good sanitizer will typically remove or strip JavaScript-related attributes or sanitize their values to prevent code execution.

*   **Potential Bypass Scenarios (More likely than `<script>` tag bypass, but still should be mitigated by `github/markup`):**
    *   **Attribute Name Variations:**  Trying variations in attribute names (e.g., `Onload`, `oNload`).  Sanitizers should be case-insensitive for attribute names.
    *   **Encoded Characters in Attribute Names/Values:**  Using HTML entities or URL encoding within attribute names or values to bypass simple filters. (e.g., `on&#111;load`).  Sanitizers should decode entities before processing attributes.
    *   **Obfuscated JavaScript:**  Using JavaScript encoding (e.g., URL encoding, base64) within event handler values to make the payload less obvious to simple filters.  Sanitizers need to be aware of common JavaScript encoding techniques.
    *   **Less Common Event Handlers:**  Attackers might try to use less frequently used event handlers that might be overlooked by less comprehensive sanitizers.

*   **Example Payloads:**
    ```markdown
    <img src="invalid-image.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS via onerror attribute!');">
    ```
    ```markdown
    <a href="#" onclick="alert('XSS via onclick attribute!');">Click me</a>
    ```
    ```markdown
    <div onmouseover="alert('XSS via onmouseover attribute!');">Hover over me</div>
    ```
    ```markdown
    <body onload="alert('XSS via onload on body tag!');">
    ```

*   **Mitigation within GitHub Markup and Applications:**
    *   **Attribute Sanitization Whitelist:**  `github/markup`'s sanitizer should use a strict whitelist of allowed HTML attributes. Event handler attributes should generally be removed or very carefully controlled. If event handlers are absolutely necessary for specific markup formats, their values must be rigorously sanitized to prevent JavaScript execution.
    *   **Attribute Value Sanitization:**  Even for allowed attributes, their values should be sanitized to prevent injection. For example, `href` attributes should be checked to ensure they are valid URLs and not `javascript:` URLs.
    *   **CSP:**  Again, CSP is crucial to mitigate the impact even if event handler injection bypasses sanitization.

#### 4.3. HTML5 Payloads

*   **Description:**  HTML5 introduced new tags and attributes that can potentially be exploited for JavaScript injection. Attackers might leverage these newer features to bypass older or less comprehensive sanitization rules that are not updated to handle HTML5 effectively.

*   **How it Works:**  HTML5 introduced tags like `<svg>`, `<math>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, and attributes like `data-*`, `poster` (for `<video>`), and `srcdoc` (for `<iframe>`). Some of these can be manipulated to execute JavaScript, often in more subtle ways than traditional `<script>` tags or event handlers.

*   **GitHub Markup Context:**  `github/markup` needs to ensure its sanitization rules are up-to-date with HTML5 and properly handle these newer tags and attributes.  Older sanitizers might not be aware of these HTML5 attack vectors.

*   **Specific HTML5 Attack Vectors and Examples:**
    *   **`<svg>` and `<math>` tags with `onload`:**  These tags can also support event handlers like `onload`.
        ```markdown
        <svg onload="alert('XSS via SVG onload!');"></svg>
        ```
        ```markdown
        <math><maction actiontype="statusline" xlink:href="javascript:alert('XSS via math tag!');">Click</maction></math>
        ```
    *   **`<iframe srcdoc>`:** The `srcdoc` attribute allows embedding HTML content directly within an `<iframe>`. If sanitization is not applied to the `srcdoc` content, attackers can inject JavaScript within the iframe's HTML.
        ```markdown
        <iframe srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;body onload='alert(\'XSS via iframe srcdoc!\')'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe>
        ```
    *   **`<video>`/`<audio>` `poster` attribute with `javascript:` URL:**  While less common, some browsers might execute JavaScript if a `javascript:` URL is used in the `poster` attribute of `<video>` or `<audio>` tags.
        ```markdown
        <video poster="javascript:alert('XSS via video poster!');"></video>
        ```
    *   **Data Attributes (`data-*`) and JavaScript access:** While `data-*` attributes themselves don't directly execute JavaScript, they can be used to store data that is later accessed and potentially misused by other injected JavaScript (if other injection vectors are present).  While not direct injection, they can be part of a more complex attack.

*   **Mitigation within GitHub Markup and Applications:**
    *   **HTML5-Aware Sanitization:**  Use a modern HTML sanitizer that is aware of HTML5 tags and attributes and has rules to properly sanitize or remove potentially dangerous HTML5 features.
    *   **Regular Sanitizer Updates:**  Keep the HTML sanitizer library updated to ensure it includes protection against newly discovered HTML5-based XSS vectors.
    *   **Strict CSP:**  CSP remains a critical defense-in-depth layer to mitigate the impact of any HTML5-related injection bypasses.
    *   **Careful Handling of `<iframe>` and similar tags:**  If `<iframe>` or similar tags are allowed, their attributes, especially `srcdoc` and `src`, must be rigorously sanitized. Consider restricting or disallowing these tags if possible.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Inject Malicious JavaScript via Markup" highlights the critical importance of robust HTML sanitization when processing user-supplied markup. While `github/markup` likely employs strong sanitization mechanisms, it's crucial to understand the potential attack vectors and ensure that the sanitization is comprehensive and up-to-date, especially with the evolving landscape of HTML5.

Development teams using `github/markup` should:

*   **Trust, but Verify:**  While `github/markup` is designed for safe markup processing, it's essential to understand the sanitization capabilities and limitations.
*   **Implement Defense-in-Depth:**  Relying solely on sanitization is not enough. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of JavaScript injection.
*   **Regularly Review and Update:**  Keep the sanitization library updated and conduct regular security audits to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or bypasses.
*   **Educate Developers:**  Ensure developers understand the risks of XSS and the importance of secure markup processing and output encoding.

By proactively addressing these points, applications using `github/markup` can significantly reduce the risk of successful JavaScript injection attacks via markup.
