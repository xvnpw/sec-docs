# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for github/markup

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization Before Markup Processing](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_before_markup_processing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Sanitization Before Markup Processing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Pinpoint all locations in your application where user-provided or external markup content is received before being processed by `github/markup`.
    2.  **Define Sanitization Rules:** Create a set of rules to identify and neutralize potentially harmful markup constructs *before* they reach `github/markup*. Focus on stripping or encoding elements and attributes known to be risky in markup contexts, such as inline JavaScript event handlers, dangerous URLs, and malicious HTML tags.
    3.  **Implement Sanitization Logic:**  Write code (or use a dedicated input sanitization library) to process the input content according to your defined rules. This typically involves stripping unsafe tags, encoding harmful characters, filtering attributes, and validating URLs.
    4.  **Apply Sanitization at Input:** Integrate the sanitization logic at the earliest possible point in your application's data flow, right after receiving the input and *before* passing it to `github/markup`.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Rules:**  Periodically review and update your sanitization rules as new attack vectors emerge or as your application's markup requirements evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into the application through user input that is immediately reflected back to the user.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of stored XSS by sanitizing input before it is stored.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious scripts from being introduced at the input stage.
    *   **XSS - Stored (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk, but output sanitization is still crucial for stored XSS.
    *   **HTML Injection (High Impact):** Effectively prevents basic HTML injection attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the project. Input sanitization is applied to user comments in blog posts, using a basic regex-based filter to remove `<script>` tags.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input sanitization is missing in user profile descriptions, forum post content, file upload descriptions, and API endpoints that accept markup content. A dedicated input sanitization library is not used, relying on basic regex which is less robust. URL validation in attributes is not consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory HTML Output Sanitization After `github/markup` Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_html_output_sanitization_after__githubmarkup__rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Mandatory HTML Output Sanitization After `github/markup` Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Robust Sanitization Library:** Select a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library appropriate for your application's backend language (e.g., DOMPurify, jsoup, Bleach).
    2.  **Integrate Sanitization Library:**  Incorporate the chosen sanitization library into your application's rendering pipeline, *immediately after* `github/markup` has generated the HTML output and *before* this HTML is displayed.
    3.  **Configure Sanitization Library:**  Configure the library with a strict whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes. Start with a minimal set and only add more if absolutely required after careful security review.
    4.  **Apply Sanitization to Output:**  Apply the sanitization function to the HTML string generated by `github/markup`.
    5.  **Regularly Update Sanitization Library:**  Keep the sanitization library updated to the latest version.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):**  Provides a second layer of defense against reflected XSS.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (High Severity):**  Essential for mitigating stored XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **DOM-Based XSS (Medium Severity):** Can help mitigate some forms of DOM-based XSS.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):**  Effectively prevents HTML injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected (High Impact):**  Provides a strong defense, significantly reducing the risk even if input sanitization fails.
    *   **XSS - Stored (High Impact):**  Crucial for preventing the exploitation of stored XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **DOM-Based XSS (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk, but may not fully eliminate all DOM-based XSS vectors.
    *   **HTML Injection (High Impact):**  Effectively eliminates HTML injection attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented at all in the project. Raw HTML output from `github/markup` is directly rendered.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Output sanitization is missing across the entire application wherever `github/markup` is used to render content, including blog posts, user profiles, forum discussions, and help documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Output Encoding](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_output_encoding.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Context-Aware Output Encoding
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Contexts:** Determine all the different contexts where the sanitized HTML output from `github/markup` will be inserted (HTML body, HTML attributes, JavaScript strings, etc.).
    2.  **Choose Appropriate Encoding Functions:** Select encoding functions specific to each output context (HTML entity encoding, HTML attribute encoding, JavaScript string encoding, URL encoding).
    3.  **Apply Encoding in Templating/Rendering Logic:**  Integrate the appropriate encoding functions into your application's templating engine or rendering logic.
    4.  **Review and Test Encoding:**  Thoroughly review your templating code and test different output contexts to verify correct encoding.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (Medium Severity):**  Provides an additional layer of defense against reflected XSS.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (Medium Severity):**  Offers a supplementary defense for stored XSS.
    *   **HTML Injection (Low Severity):**  Provides a minor additional layer of defense against HTML injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected (Medium Impact):**  Adds a valuable layer of defense, reducing the risk further.
    *   **XSS - Stored (Medium Impact):**  Provides an extra safety net, making it harder to exploit stored XSS.
    *   **HTML Injection (Low Impact):**  Minimal impact on preventing basic HTML injection, as sanitization is the primary defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The templating engine provides default HTML entity encoding for body content, but attribute encoding and JavaScript string encoding are not consistently applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Context-aware output encoding is missing or inconsistently applied in HTML attribute values, JavaScript code dynamically generating HTML, and custom components rendering `github/markup` output.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_strict_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict Policy:**  Start with a very restrictive CSP like `default-src 'none'`.
    2.  **Whitelist Necessary Sources:**  Gradually add directives to whitelist only essential sources for scripts (`script-src 'self'`), styles (`style-src 'self'`), images (`img-src 'self' data:`), and restrict other resource types (`object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, etc.).
    3.  **Deploy CSP Header:** Configure your web server to send the CSP header with every HTTP response.
    4.  **Test and Refine CSP:**  Thoroughly test your application with the CSP enabled and resolve any violations.
    5.  **Monitor CSP Reports:**  Enable CSP reporting to collect reports of violations and monitor them.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update CSP:**  Periodically review and update your CSP as your application evolves.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the impact of reflected XSS.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (High Severity):**  Crucially mitigates stored XSS.
    *   **DOM-Based XSS (Medium Severity):**  Can limit the impact of some DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):**  `frame-ancestors 'none'` directive prevents clickjacking attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected (High Impact):**  Provides a very strong defense against XSS.
    *   **XSS - Stored (High Impact):**  Crucial for mitigating stored XSS, making it extremely difficult to exploit.
    *   **DOM-Based XSS (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the impact, but may not fully eliminate all DOM-based XSS vectors.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Impact):**  Effectively prevents clickjacking attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A basic CSP is in place, but it is not very strict and uses `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` directives, weakening its effectiveness. `frame-ancestors` is not set.
*   **Missing Implementation:** CSP is not strict enough and needs to be tightened. `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` directives need to be removed or minimized. `frame-ancestors 'none'` needs to be implemented. CSP reporting is not enabled, and CSP is not regularly reviewed and updated.
