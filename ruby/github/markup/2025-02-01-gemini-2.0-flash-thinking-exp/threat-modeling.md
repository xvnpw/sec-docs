# Threat Model Analysis for github/markup

## Threat: [Unsanitized HTML Output (XSS)](./threats/unsanitized_html_output__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML code within markup input. `github/markup` or the underlying markup engine fails to sanitize this HTML, rendering it directly in the application's output. The attacker can then execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  User session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, and other client-side attacks.

**Affected Markup Component:** Markup Rendering Engine (e.g., Redcarpet, RDiscount, etc.), Output Handling within `github/markup`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   Regularly update `github/markup` and its dependencies.
*   Sanitize the HTML output of `github/markup` using a dedicated HTML sanitization library before displaying it to users.
*   Employ context-aware output encoding based on where the output is used (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML context).

## Threat: [Bypassing Sanitization Filters (XSS)](./threats/bypassing_sanitization_filters__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts specific markup input designed to circumvent the sanitization filters implemented by `github/markup` or the underlying markup engine. This allows malicious HTML to pass through and be rendered.

**Impact:** Similar to unsanitized HTML output, leading to XSS vulnerabilities and client-side attacks.

**Affected Markup Component:** Sanitization Logic within `github/markup` or the Markup Rendering Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated on security advisories for `github/markup` and its dependencies.
*   Conduct regular security testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing, specifically targeting sanitization bypasses.
*   Employ multiple layers of sanitization, potentially using different sanitization libraries or techniques.
*   Favor allow-listing over deny-listing for allowed HTML tags and attributes in sanitization rules.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Markup Engines (XSS)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_markup_engines__xss_.md)

**Description:** The underlying markup engines used by `github/markup` (e.g., Redcarpet, Kramdown) contain inherent vulnerabilities in their parsing or rendering logic. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific markup input that triggers the flaw, leading to malicious HTML injection.

**Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities originating from flaws in external libraries, resulting in client-side attacks.

**Affected Markup Component:** External Markup Rendering Engines (Dependencies of `github/markup`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `github/markup` and all its dependencies, especially markup engines, updated to the latest versions.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for the specific markup engines used.
*   Consider using markup engines with a strong security track record and active maintenance.
*   Implement input validation to reject overly complex or suspicious markup structures that might trigger engine vulnerabilities.
