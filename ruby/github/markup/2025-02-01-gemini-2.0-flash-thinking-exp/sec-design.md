# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `github/markup`, aims to provide a reliable and secure library for rendering various markup languages into HTML. This is a core component for GitHub's functionality, as it enables the platform to display user-generated content in a readable and consistent format across different markup dialects.

Business Priorities:
- Reliability: The markup rendering must be highly reliable to ensure consistent display of content across GitHub. Downtime or rendering errors would negatively impact user experience.
- Security: The rendering process must be secure to prevent vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which could compromise user accounts and data.
- Performance: Rendering should be performant to avoid delays in content display and maintain a responsive user experience.
- Maintainability: The codebase should be maintainable to allow for updates, bug fixes, and the addition of new markup language support as needed.

Business Risks:
- Security Vulnerabilities: Exploitable vulnerabilities in the markup parsing and rendering logic could lead to significant security breaches, including XSS and other injection attacks.
- Rendering Errors: Incorrect or inconsistent rendering of markup could lead to user confusion, data misinterpretation, and a degraded user experience.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient rendering processes could lead to performance issues, especially under heavy load, impacting the overall responsiveness of GitHub.
- Supply Chain Risks: Dependencies used by the project could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and vetted.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: GitHub's Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) - Assumed to be in place for all GitHub projects, including code reviews, security testing, and vulnerability management. (Location: GitHub's internal security policies and procedures)
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Assumed to be in place to detect known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. (Location: GitHub's internal security tooling and processes)
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Assumed to be conducted on core GitHub components, potentially including markup rendering. (Location: GitHub's security audit logs and reports)
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions - As an open-source project, there is a reliance on community contributions, which may introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) - Implement DAST tools to test the rendered output for vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks.
- security control: Fuzzing - Employ fuzzing techniques to automatically generate and test a wide range of inputs to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities.
- security control: Input Validation - Rigorously validate all input markup to ensure it conforms to expected formats and prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Output Encoding - Properly encode all rendered output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by neutralizing potentially malicious scripts.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the markup rendering library itself, as it is a component within the broader GitHub platform. Authentication is handled at the GitHub platform level.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the markup rendering library itself. Authorization is handled at the GitHub platform level, determining what content users are allowed to access and render.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All input markup must be strictly validated against the expected syntax for each supported markup language.
    - Requirement: Input validation should prevent injection attacks by sanitizing or rejecting potentially malicious markup constructs.
    - Requirement: Implement robust error handling for invalid markup input to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core markup rendering functionality. Cryptography is relevant for secure communication and data storage within the broader GitHub platform, but not directly within the markup rendering library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Rendering user-generated content across the GitHub platform. This is critical for user experience, communication, and collaboration on GitHub.

Data to Protect:
- User-provided markup content: This data is of moderate sensitivity. While not typically classified as highly confidential, its integrity and availability are crucial for GitHub's functionality. Maliciously crafted markup could be used for attacks.
- Rendered HTML output: The integrity and security of the rendered HTML are paramount to prevent XSS and other client-side vulnerabilities.

Data Sensitivity:
- Moderate. User-provided markup content itself is generally not highly sensitive in terms of confidentiality, but its potential to be exploited for security vulnerabilities elevates its importance in terms of integrity and availability. The rendered HTML output is highly sensitive from a security perspective due to XSS risks.
