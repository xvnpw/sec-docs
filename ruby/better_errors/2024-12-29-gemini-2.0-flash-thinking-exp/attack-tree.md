## Threat Model: Compromising Application via BetterErrors - High-Risk Focus

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, execute arbitrary code on the server, or disrupt the application's functionality by leveraging the capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of the BetterErrors gem.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via BetterErrors [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Exploit Information Disclosure via BetterErrors [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * BetterErrors Enabled in Accessible Environment [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Accidental Deployment to Production with BetterErrors Enabled [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Obtain Sensitive Information from Error Page [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * View Environment Variables (including secrets) [CRITICAL NODE]
            * View Database Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]
            * View API Keys [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Achieve Remote Code Execution via BetterErrors Interactive Console [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * BetterErrors Interactive Console Enabled [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Configuration Allows Interactive Console in Accessible Environment [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Access Error Page with Interactive Console Enabled [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Execute Arbitrary Code via Interactive Console [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Execute System Commands [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Modify Application State [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Access Internal Resources [CRITICAL NODE]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Information Disclosure via BetterErrors**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the presence of BetterErrors in an accessible environment to trigger application errors and subsequently view sensitive information displayed on the error page.
* **Critical Node: BetterErrors Enabled in Accessible Environment:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the fundamental prerequisite for this high-risk path. If BetterErrors is enabled in an environment the attacker can reach (development, staging, or accidentally production), it opens the door for information disclosure.
* **High-Risk Path: Accidental Deployment to Production with BetterErrors Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  A critical mistake where BetterErrors, intended for development, is active in the production environment. This exposes the live application to information disclosure vulnerabilities.
* **Critical Node: Accidental Deployment to Production with BetterErrors Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This specific scenario is highly critical due to the potential exposure of sensitive production data and the higher likelihood of attacker interest in production systems.
* **High-Risk Path: Obtain Sensitive Information from Error Page:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once an error is triggered and the BetterErrors page is accessible, the attacker directly views the information presented, which can include environment variables, code snippets, and potentially credentials.
* **Critical Node: Obtain Sensitive Information from Error Page:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the point where the attacker achieves their goal of gaining access to sensitive data.
* **Critical Node: View Environment Variables (including secrets):**
    * **Attack Vector:** BetterErrors displays environment variables, which often contain sensitive secrets like API keys, database credentials, and other configuration details.
* **Critical Node: View Database Credentials:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If database interactions cause errors, BetterErrors might display the database connection string or related information, exposing credentials.
* **Critical Node: View API Keys:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to database credentials, API keys used for external services might be visible in the error output.

**High-Risk Path: Achieve Remote Code Execution via BetterErrors Interactive Console**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the interactive console feature of BetterErrors, if enabled, to execute arbitrary code on the server. This requires triggering an error to activate the console.
* **Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution via BetterErrors Interactive Console:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This represents the most severe outcome, granting the attacker complete control over the server.
* **High-Risk Path: BetterErrors Interactive Console Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the crucial enabling condition for remote code execution. If the interactive console is not enabled, this attack path is blocked.
* **Critical Node: BetterErrors Interactive Console Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The presence of the enabled interactive console is the primary vulnerability being exploited in this path.
* **Critical Node: Configuration Allows Interactive Console in Accessible Environment:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  A misconfiguration that allows the interactive console to be active in an environment accessible to attackers.
* **High-Risk Path: Access Error Page with Interactive Console Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:** After triggering an error, the attacker accesses the BetterErrors error page where the interactive console is available.
* **Critical Node: Access Error Page with Interactive Console Enabled:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the point where the attacker gains access to the code execution environment.
* **High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary Code via Interactive Console:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once the console is accessible, the attacker can execute any valid Ruby code, leading to various forms of compromise.
* **Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code via Interactive Console:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the direct action that leads to system compromise.
* **Critical Node: Execute System Commands:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Using Ruby's system calls, the attacker can execute shell commands on the server's operating system.
* **Critical Node: Modify Application State:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker can interact with the application's objects and data in memory, potentially changing critical settings or granting themselves privileges.
* **Critical Node: Access Internal Resources:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker can use the application's context to access files, databases, and other internal resources that the application has access to.
