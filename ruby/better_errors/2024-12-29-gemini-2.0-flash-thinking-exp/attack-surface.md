**Key Attack Surface List: Better Errors Gem (High & Critical - Direct Involvement)**

* **Information Disclosure - Source Code Exposure:**
    * **Description:**  When an error occurs, `better_errors` displays the application's source code surrounding the error location.
    * **How Better Errors Contributes:** This is a core feature of `better_errors` to aid in debugging. It directly renders the code snippets in the browser.
    * **Example:** A user triggers a `NoMethodError`. The `better_errors` page shows the controller action and model code where the error occurred, revealing business logic and potentially sensitive algorithms.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain insights into the application's internal workings, identify vulnerabilities, understand data flows, and potentially discover hardcoded secrets or API keys.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (in non-development environments)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable in Production:** Ensure `better_errors` is completely disabled in production environments. This is the most critical mitigation.
        * **Restrict Access in Development:** Use strong IP whitelisting or basic authentication to limit access to `better_errors` in development and staging environments.

* **Information Disclosure - Environment Variables Exposure:**
    * **Description:** `better_errors` often displays the environment variables active during the error.
    * **How Better Errors Contributes:**  `better_errors` collects and displays environment information to provide context for debugging.
    * **Example:** An error occurs, and the `better_errors` page reveals environment variables containing database credentials, API keys for external services, or other sensitive configuration details.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of environment variables can lead to direct compromise of connected services, data breaches, and unauthorized access to critical resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (in non-development environments)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable in Production:**  Absolutely disable `better_errors` in production.
        * **Restrict Access in Development:** Implement robust access controls for development environments.

* **Code Execution - Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) Access:**
    * **Description:** `better_errors` provides an interactive Ruby REPL within the error page.
    * **How Better Errors Contributes:** This is a deliberate feature of `better_errors` to allow developers to inspect and manipulate the application state during an error.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to a `better_errors` page in a production environment and uses the REPL to execute arbitrary Ruby code, potentially reading files, accessing databases, or even taking control of the server.
    * **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and any other action achievable through arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (in non-development environments)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable in Production:**  This is paramount. Never enable `better_errors` in production.
        * **Strong Access Control in Development:**  Implement very strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting, strong authentication) for development environments where the REPL is active.
