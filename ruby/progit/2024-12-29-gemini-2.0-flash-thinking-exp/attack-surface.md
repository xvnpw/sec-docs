Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `progit`, with high or critical severity:

* **Attack Surface: Content Injection via Rendered Documentation**
    * **Description:** If the application renders content directly from the `progit/progit` repository, malicious actors could inject harmful content within the repository's files.
    * **How progit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `progit/progit` repository provides the source content (Markdown, potentially HTML if converted) that the application renders. Compromise or tampering with this repository directly introduces the malicious content.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag into a Markdown file within the `progit/progit` repository. When the application renders this content as HTML, the script executes in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. Content spoofing or defacement could also occur.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Sanitize Rendered Content:** Thoroughly sanitize any content fetched from the `progit/progit` repository before rendering it, especially if rendering as HTML. Use established libraries designed for this purpose.
        * **Sandboxed Rendering:** Consider rendering the content in a sandboxed environment (e.g., an iframe with restricted permissions) to limit the potential damage from malicious code.
        * **Regularly Update and Verify Repository:** Keep the local copy of the `progit/progit` repository updated from the trusted upstream source and implement integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications.

* **Attack Surface: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (If Directly Serving Files from progit)**
    * **Description:** If the application directly serves files from the `progit/progit` repository based on user input, a path traversal vulnerability could allow attackers to access files within the `progit/progit` repository that are not intended to be publicly accessible.
    * **How progit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The file structure of the `progit/progit` repository becomes directly accessible through the application's file serving mechanism.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `example.com/docs?file=../../.git/config` to attempt to access the Git configuration file within the `progit/progit` repository if the application directly serves files based on the `file` parameter.
    * **Impact:** Access to potentially sensitive files within the `progit/progit` repository, which could reveal information about the documentation structure or internal notes (though less critical than system files).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Direct File Serving:** Whenever possible, avoid directly serving files from the `progit/progit` repository based on user-provided paths.
        * **Strict Input Validation:** If direct file serving is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attempts.
        * **Whitelisting:** Use a whitelist of allowed files or directories within the `progit/progit` repository that can be served.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application process has the minimum necessary permissions to access files within the `progit/progit` repository.
