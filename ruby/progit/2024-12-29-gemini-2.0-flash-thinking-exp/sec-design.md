# Project Design Document: Pro Git Book Delivery System

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document details the design of the system responsible for delivering the Pro Git book content, as hosted on the GitHub repository [https://github.com/progit/progit](https://github.com/progit/progit). This document serves as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities by providing a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, components, and data flow.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide a clear and detailed description of the Pro Git book delivery system's architecture.
*   Identify and describe the key components involved in the content delivery process, including their technologies and responsibilities.
*   Illustrate the flow of data within the system, highlighting key interactions between components.
*   Establish a solid basis for identifying and analyzing potential security threats and vulnerabilities within the system.

## 3. Scope

This design document focuses on the technical infrastructure and processes involved in making the Pro Git book content available to end-users. This includes:

*   The source repository hosted on GitHub.
*   The automated build and deployment pipelines.
*   The content delivery network (CDN) or hosting platform serving the book content.
*   The methods by which end-users access the content (primarily web browsers).

This document explicitly excludes:

*   The actual content of the Pro Git book itself (text, images, etc.).
*   The internal workings and security of the Git version control system.
*   The detailed operational procedures for maintaining the system.
*   The intricacies of GitHub's platform beyond its role as the source repository.
*   Specific configurations of individual software components (e.g., web server configurations).

## 4. System Architecture

The Pro Git book delivery system employs a static site generation and deployment model. The source content, typically in Markdown or AsciiDoc, is processed by a build system to generate static output files (HTML, PDF, EPUB). These files are then deployed to a hosting platform for end-user access.

## 5. Components

This section provides a detailed description of the key components within the Pro Git book delivery system.

*   **Pro Git Repository (GitHub):**
    *   Description: The authoritative source code repository for the Pro Git book. It contains the book's content files, build scripts, configuration files, and potentially other assets.
    *   Technology: Git, GitHub.
    *   Function: Serves as the version-controlled storage for all book-related source materials. It also provides mechanisms for collaboration and triggering automated processes.

*   **Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions):**
    *   Description: An automated system responsible for compiling the book's source content into various distributable formats. This typically involves a series of steps defined in a workflow.
    *   Technology: Likely GitHub Actions, potentially utilizing tools like static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo), Pandoc, or custom scripts.
    *   Function: Executes build scripts upon triggers (e.g., code commits), processes the source files, and generates output artifacts (HTML, PDF, EPUB).

*   **Artifact Storage (e.g., GitHub Actions Artifacts):**
    *   Description: A temporary or persistent storage location used to hold the generated build artifacts before they are deployed.
    *   Technology:  Could be GitHub Actions built-in artifact storage, or an external storage service depending on the deployment setup.
    *   Function: Provides a staging area for the built book files, ensuring they are available for the deployment process.

*   **Deployment System (e.g., Netlify, Vercel CLI):**
    *   Description: The system responsible for taking the built artifacts and deploying them to the hosting platform. This might involve command-line interface tools or platform-specific deployment mechanisms.
    *   Technology: Examples include Netlify CLI, Vercel CLI, `git push` to a connected platform, or custom deployment scripts.
    *   Function: Transfers the built artifacts from the artifact storage to the CDN/Hosting Platform, making them accessible to end-users.

*   **CDN / Hosting Platform (e.g., Netlify CDN, Vercel Edge Network):**
    *   Description: The infrastructure that hosts the static book content and serves it to end-users. This often includes a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for improved performance and availability.
    *   Technology: Web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache), CDN infrastructure (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, platform-specific CDNs), static file hosting services.
    *   Function: Stores the static HTML, PDF, EPUB files and delivers them to users' browsers upon request, often leveraging caching mechanisms for efficiency.

*   **End-User Browser:**
    *   Description: The web browser application used by readers to access and view the Pro Git book content.
    *   Technology: Web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
    *   Function: Sends requests for book content to the CDN/Hosting Platform and renders the received HTML, PDF, or other formats for the user.

## 6. Data Flow

This section describes the movement of data through the Pro Git book delivery system, outlining the interactions between the components.

*   **Content Update:**
    *   A developer or author commits changes to the Pro Git Repository on GitHub. These changes include source files, build scripts, or configuration updates.

*   **Build Trigger:**
    *   The commit to the repository triggers the Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions) based on configured webhooks or triggers.

*   **Source Code Retrieval:**
    *   The Build System retrieves the latest version of the source code and necessary files from the Pro Git Repository.

*   **Content Compilation:**
    *   The Build System executes the defined build steps, processing the source content using tools like static site generators or document converters to generate HTML, PDF, and EPUB files.

*   **Artifact Storage:**
    *   The generated build artifacts (HTML, PDF, EPUB files, and potentially other assets) are stored in the Artifact Storage.

*   **Deployment Initiation:**
    *   The Deployment System is triggered, either automatically after a successful build or manually.

*   **Artifact Retrieval for Deployment:**
    *   The Deployment System retrieves the built artifacts from the Artifact Storage.

*   **Content Deployment:**
    *   The Deployment System uploads or synchronizes the retrieved artifacts to the CDN / Hosting Platform.

*   **User Content Request:**
    *   An End-User Browser sends a request to the CDN / Hosting Platform for a specific page or file of the Pro Git book.

*   **Content Delivery:**
    *   The CDN / Hosting Platform locates the requested content (potentially from a cache) and delivers it to the End-User Browser.
