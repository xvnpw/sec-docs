# Attack Surface Analysis for progit/progit

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Embedded HTML](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_embedded_html.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the rendered HTML, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.
    *   **How progit contributes to the attack surface:** The `progit/progit` repository contains Markdown files that can include raw HTML. If the application renders this Markdown to HTML without proper sanitization, `<script>` tags or HTML event attributes containing malicious JavaScript can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** A Markdown file within the `progit` repository containing the following: `` `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>` ``. If rendered directly, this script would execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and potentially more severe attacks depending on the application's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Sanitize user-provided content (if applicable based on how your application uses `progit`).
        *   Use a secure Markdown rendering library that escapes harmful HTML by default.
        *   Avoid direct HTML rendering if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Iframe Injection](./attack_surfaces/iframe_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious iframes into the rendered output, potentially redirecting users to phishing sites, performing clickjacking attacks, or delivering malware.
    *   **How progit contributes to the attack surface:** Markdown allows embedding `<iframe>` tags.
    *   **Example:** A Markdown file containing: `` `<iframe src="https://malicious.example.com"></iframe>` ``.
    *   **Impact:** Redirection to malicious websites, clickjacking attacks, potential malware infections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) using `frame-ancestors` or `sandbox` directives.
        *   Sanitize or remove `<iframe>` tags during Markdown rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerability (Compromised Repository)](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerability__compromised_repository_.md)

*   **Description:** If the `progit/progit` repository itself is compromised, malicious content could be injected directly into the source material, affecting any application using it.
    *   **How progit contributes to the attack surface:** Direct dependency on an external repository.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the `progit` repository and adds a Markdown file containing XSS or modifies existing files to include malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of applications using the affected version of `progit`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Verify signatures or hashes of the `progit` repository or specific releases.
        *   Pin the specific version or commit hash of `progit` your application uses.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to `progit`.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Markdown Content](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_markdown_content.md)

*   **Description:** While less likely for a public documentation repository, if the application were using a private fork or similar, sensitive information could be accidentally included in Markdown files.
    *   **How progit contributes to the attack surface:** The content of the Markdown files themselves.
    *   **Example:** A Markdown file containing an accidentally committed API key or internal URL.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regular security audits of the `progit` repository content (or forks).
        *   Implement secure development practices to avoid committing sensitive data.
        *   Utilize secrets management tools for sensitive information.
