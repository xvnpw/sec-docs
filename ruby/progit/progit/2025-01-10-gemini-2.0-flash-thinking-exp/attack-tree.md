            * Implement examples without proper sanitization or validation [HIGH-RISK STEP]
    * Introduce Insecure Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Misunderstanding security implications of configurations [HIGH-RISK STEP]
            * Configure Git hooks in a way that introduces vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK STEP]

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using progit/progit [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_progitprogit__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Vulnerable Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerable_code__critical_node_.md)

This represents the introduction of security flaws into the application's codebase due to the use of `progit/progit`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Copy-pasting vulnerable examples [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/copy-pasting_vulnerable_examples__critical_node_.md)

Developers directly copy code snippets from the book without fully understanding their security implications or the need for sanitization and validation in the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use outdated or insecure Git commands from the book [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/use_outdated_or_insecure_git_commands_from_the_book__high-risk_step_.md)

The book might contain examples using older Git commands that have known vulnerabilities or are considered insecure in modern contexts. Developers using these commands directly could introduce weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Implement examples without proper sanitization or validation [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/implement_examples_without_proper_sanitization_or_validation__high-risk_step_.md)

Code examples in the book, intended for educational purposes, might lack necessary input sanitization or output encoding. Directly implementing these examples in a live application can lead to vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL Injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Insecure Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_insecure_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This involves setting up Git or related configurations in a way that weakens the application's security, based on information or examples from the book.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misunderstanding security implications of configurations [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/misunderstanding_security_implications_of_configurations__high-risk_step_.md)

Developers fail to fully grasp the security ramifications of certain Git configurations explained in the book.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configure Git hooks in a way that introduces vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/configure_git_hooks_in_a_way_that_introduces_vulnerabilities__high-risk_step_.md)

Developers might misunderstand the security implications of Git hooks and create hooks that introduce vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized code changes or bypassing security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information__critical_node_.md)

This refers to the unintentional exposure of sensitive data within the Git repository due to practices learned or exemplified in the book.

## Attack Tree Path: [Including sensitive data in Git history based on examples [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/including_sensitive_data_in_git_history_based_on_examples__high-risk_step_.md)

The book might show basic commit examples without emphasizing the importance of avoiding the commit of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Commit secrets or credentials following examples showing basic commits [HIGH-RISK STEP]](./attack_tree_paths/commit_secrets_or_credentials_following_examples_showing_basic_commits__high-risk_step_.md)

Developers, following basic examples in the book, might inadvertently commit secrets, API keys, or other sensitive credentials directly into the Git repository, making them accessible to anyone with access to the repository history.
