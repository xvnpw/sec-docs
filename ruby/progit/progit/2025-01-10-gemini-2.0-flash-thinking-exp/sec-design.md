**6. Data Flow**

This section describes the flow of data through the system for typical user interactions and content updates.

*   **User Accessing the Online Version:**
    1. A user's web browser initiates a request for a page from the Pro Git website (e.g., `progit.org/book/`).
    2. The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves the domain name to the CDN's edge servers.
    3. The CDN edge server checks its cache for the requested resource.
        *   **Cache Hit:** If the resource is cached, the CDN serves the content directly to the user's browser.
        *   **Cache Miss:** If the resource is not cached, the CDN requests it from the origin web server(s).
    4. The web server retrieves the requested HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files from its storage.
    5. The web server sends the requested resources back to the CDN edge server.
    6. The CDN edge server caches the content and serves it to the user's browser.
    7. The user's browser renders the web page.

*   **User Downloading a Book Format:**
    1. A user clicks a download link for a specific book format (e.g., a PDF link).
    2. The browser sends a request to the URL associated with the downloadable file on the Download Storage.
    3. The Download Storage retrieves the requested file.
    4. The Download Storage streams the file content to the user's browser.
    5. The user's browser downloads the file.

*   **Content Update Process:**
    1. A contributor commits and pushes changes to the Pro Git book's source files in the GitHub repository.
    2. GitHub sends a webhook notification to the Build & Publishing Pipeline.
    3. The CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
    4. The pipeline retrieves the latest content from the GitHub repository.
    5. The pipeline executes the build process, generating updated website artifacts and downloadable files.
    6. The pipeline deploys the new website artifacts to the Web Server(s).
    7. The pipeline uploads the new downloadable files to the Download Storage.
    8. The pipeline triggers a CDN cache invalidation for the relevant paths to ensure users receive the latest content.
