# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository 'progit/progit', aims to provide a comprehensive, free, and open-source guide to Git. The primary business priority is to disseminate knowledge about Git to a wide audience, making it accessible and understandable for both beginners and experienced users. The project goals include maintaining the accuracy, relevance, and quality of the book's content, ensuring its availability, and fostering a community around Git learning and usage.

Key business risks associated with this project include:

- Risk of content integrity compromise: Unauthorized modifications or corruption of the book's content could undermine its credibility and usefulness.
- Risk of availability disruption: Inaccessibility of the repository or the book's online version would hinder the project's primary goal of knowledge dissemination.
- Risk of reputational damage: Publication of inaccurate, outdated, or misleading information could negatively impact the project's reputation and the trust of its users.
- Risk of contribution quality degradation:  Acceptance of low-quality or malicious contributions could negatively affect the book's overall quality and integrity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the 'progit/progit' project, primarily provided by the GitHub platform, include:

- security control: GitHub platform authentication and authorization mechanisms for repository access and management. Implemented by GitHub.
- security control: GitHub infrastructure security measures protecting the repository and its data. Implemented by GitHub.
- security control: Git version control system, providing content integrity and history tracking. Implemented by Git.
- security control: Public accessibility of the repository, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented by GitHub.

Accepted risks for this project include:

- accepted risk: Reliance on GitHub's security infrastructure and practices.
- accepted risk: Public accessibility of the repository, making it potentially vulnerable to public attacks (although the impact is limited for a read-mostly repository).
- accepted risk: Potential for unintentional or malicious contributions that could compromise content integrity, mitigated by review processes.

Recommended security controls to enhance the project's security posture:

- recommended security control: Implement a robust input validation and review process for all contributions (pull requests) to ensure content quality and prevent malicious insertions.
- recommended security control: Consider signing releases or tags to provide assurance of content authenticity and integrity to users downloading or referencing specific versions of the book.
- recommended security control: Implement automated checks (linters, static analysis if applicable to build scripts) to detect potential issues in contributions before merging.

Security requirements for the 'progit/progit' project:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Contributors need to authenticate to GitHub to propose changes via pull requests.
    - Requirement: Repository maintainers need to authenticate to GitHub to manage the repository, review contributions, and make releases.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: GitHub's role-based access control should be used to manage permissions for repository maintainers and contributors.
    - Requirement: Authorization is needed to control who can merge pull requests, create releases, and modify repository settings.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All contributions, especially content changes, must be reviewed and validated to ensure accuracy, quality, and absence of malicious content.
    - Requirement: If any scripts are used in the build process, inputs to these scripts should be validated to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Consider using cryptographic signatures for releases to ensure content integrity and authenticity for users downloading or referencing specific versions of the book.

```

### Build Process Description

1.  Developer makes changes to the book content in their local Git repository.
2.  Developer pushes changes to the 'progit/progit' GitHub repository.
3.  A webhook in the GitHub repository triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
4.  The GitHub Actions workflow checks out the code, builds the website (likely using a static site generator), and potentially runs security checks (linters, etc.).
5.  The build process generates build artifacts, such as website files.
6.  The GitHub Actions workflow deploys the build artifacts to GitHub Pages, making the updated website live.

### Build Security Controls

- security control: Secure GitHub Actions workflow configuration, following best practices for CI/CD security.
- security control: Secrets management in GitHub Actions to securely handle any credentials needed for the build or deployment process.
- security control: Static analysis and linting tools integrated into the build pipeline to detect potential issues in the code or content.
- security control: Dependency scanning (if applicable, e.g., if using Node.js or other package managers for build tools) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Branch protection rules on the main branch to ensure that only reviewed and approved code is merged and built.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected:

- Maintaining the integrity, availability, and accuracy of the Pro Git book content for public access and knowledge dissemination.

Data being protected and their sensitivity:

- Pro Git book content (text, images, etc.): Publicly available, but integrity and accuracy are important for the project's goals and reputation. Sensitivity: Medium (integrity and reputation impact).
- Repository metadata and Git history: Important for project management and version control. Sensitivity: Low to Medium (availability and integrity impact).
- Potential build artifacts (website files): Publicly available. Sensitivity: Low.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the exact build process used to generate the Pro Git website (if one exists)? Is it a static site generator, and if so, which one?
- Is there a formal release process for the book, and are releases signed or verified in any way?
- What is the process for reviewing and approving contributions (pull requests) to ensure content quality and prevent malicious changes?

Assumptions:

- The primary goal of the 'progit/progit' repository is to provide a free and open-source Git book for educational purposes.
- The website (if it exists) is likely a static website generated from the repository content and potentially hosted on GitHub Pages.
- The project relies heavily on the security provided by the GitHub platform.
- Contributions are managed through GitHub pull requests and are reviewed by project maintainers.
