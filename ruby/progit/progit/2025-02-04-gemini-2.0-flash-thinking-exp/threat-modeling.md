# Threat Model Analysis for progit/progit

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_content_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious scripts into the locally stored Pro Git content by directly modifying files or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's content processing. If the application renders this content in a web browser without proper sanitization, the injected scripts will execute in users' browsers when they access the Pro Git content through the application. This could be achieved by modifying markdown files to include malicious JavaScript within HTML tags or code blocks that are not correctly escaped during rendering.
Impact: **Critical**. Successful XSS attacks can allow attackers to:
    * Steal user session cookies and credentials, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts within the application.
    * Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying data, initiating transactions, or spreading malware.
    * Deface the application interface or redirect users to malicious websites.
    * Potentially compromise the user's system if browser vulnerabilities are exploited.
Pro Git Component Affected: Content files (specifically markdown or HTML files), application's markdown parsing and rendering logic, content delivery mechanism to the browser.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement robust and context-aware sanitization of all Pro Git content before rendering it in a web browser. Use a well-vetted and actively maintained markdown parsing library that includes strong XSS prevention measures. Ensure all user-controlled input and content from Pro Git is treated as untrusted and sanitized.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) header to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting script sources to trusted origins.
    * **Integrity Checks and Secure Content Storage:** Implement cryptographic integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for the Pro Git content to detect unauthorized modifications. Secure the storage location of the Pro Git content with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized write access. Regularly update the content from the official repository and re-verify integrity.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on content injection vulnerabilities in the application's Pro Git content handling and rendering mechanisms.

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection Leading to Misinformation and Insecure Git Practices](./threats/malicious_content_injection_leading_to_misinformation_and_insecure_git_practices.md)

Description: An attacker modifies the Pro Git content to subtly alter instructions or code examples to promote insecure Git practices or provide misleading information. For example, they might change commands to disable security features, recommend insecure workflows, or provide examples with vulnerabilities. This could be achieved by directly editing the markdown files to change text or code snippets.
Impact: **High**. Users relying on the modified Pro Git content might learn and adopt insecure Git practices without realizing it. This could lead to:
    * Accidental exposure of sensitive data in Git repositories.
    * Introduction of vulnerabilities into projects managed with Git.
    * Compromise of Git repositories or development workflows due to insecure configurations or practices.
    * Erosion of trust in the application as a reliable source of Git knowledge.
Pro Git Component Affected: Content files (specifically text and code examples within markdown files), application's content display and presentation.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Integrity Checks and Content Verification:** Implement strong integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for the Pro Git content to detect any unauthorized modifications. Regularly compare the local content with the official repository to ensure consistency and detect tampering.
    * **Content Review and Validation (Optional but Recommended):**  If feasible, implement a process to periodically review and validate the Pro Git content for accuracy and security best practices, especially after updates. This could involve manual review or automated checks for specific keywords or patterns associated with insecure practices.
    * **Clear Source Attribution and Versioning:** Clearly indicate the source of the Pro Git content and display the version or last updated date. Provide links to the official Pro Git book repository so users can cross-reference information and access the official, unmodified content if they have concerns.
    * **User Awareness and Disclaimers:** Include a disclaimer informing users that the application is using content from an external source (Pro Git) and encourage them to verify critical security-related information with official Git documentation or security resources.
