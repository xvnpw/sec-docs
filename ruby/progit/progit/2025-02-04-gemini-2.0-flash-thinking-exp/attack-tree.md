## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities from Outdated or Misinterpreted Git Practices [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_from_outdated_or_misinterpreted_git_practices__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path encompasses vulnerabilities arising from developers using outdated or misinterpreting Git practices potentially learned from Pro Git.  Git security best practices evolve, and even accurate information can be misapplied.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to a wide range of vulnerabilities depending on the specific misinterpretation, from information disclosure to code execution.

    *   **1.1. Exploit Insecure Git Workflow Implementation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Focuses on flaws in how the application implements Git workflows (branching, merging, hooks).  If these workflows are designed or implemented insecurely, attackers can exploit them.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to code injection, unauthorized code changes, or disruption of development processes.

        *   **1.1.2. [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Git Hook Implementation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at various stages of the Git workflow. If hooks are implemented insecurely (e.g., vulnerable to command injection, path traversal, or running with excessive privileges), attackers can exploit them.  Pro Git might provide examples of hooks, but if developers don't implement them securely, it becomes a vulnerability.
            *   **Impact:**  Potentially **High**.  Successful exploitation of insecure hooks can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or developer machines, data manipulation, or denial of service, especially if hooks run with elevated privileges.

        *   **1.1.3. [CRITICAL NODE] Exposure of .git directory or sensitive Git metadata [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Misconfiguration of the web server can lead to the `.git` directory being publicly accessible. This directory contains the entire repository history, objects, and configuration.  While Pro Git might not explicitly warn against this in a web application context, it's a critical security misstep.
            *   **Impact:**  **Medium** to **High**.  Information disclosure of the entire repository history, including potentially sensitive data, source code, and configuration details. Attackers can use this information to find further vulnerabilities or extract sensitive information.

    *   **1.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities from Code Examples/Snippets [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might copy-paste code examples from Pro Git into their application's codebase, especially when dealing with Git operations programmatically. If these examples are not reviewed for security implications and integrated without proper input sanitization, vulnerabilities can be introduced.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the code example, such as command injection or path traversal.

        *   **1.2.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Git Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses code examples from Pro Git (or inspired by it) that involve constructing Git commands dynamically, especially with user-supplied input, without proper sanitization, it can be vulnerable to command injection. An attacker can inject malicious commands into the Git command execution.
            *   **Impact:** **High**.  Arbitrary command execution on the server. Attackers can gain full control of the application server, read sensitive data, modify files, or pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities from Misunderstanding Git Security Concepts [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_from_misunderstanding_git_security_concepts__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Even with good documentation like Pro Git, developers can misunderstand or misapply Git security concepts, leading to vulnerabilities in the application.
*   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to unauthorized access depending on the specific misunderstanding.

    *   **2.1. Weak Authentication/Authorization related to Git operations [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  If developers misunderstand Git's permission model or how to properly secure Git-related features in their application (e.g., features that interact with Git repositories), they might implement weak authentication or authorization mechanisms. Pro Git explains Git's internal access control, but applying this to an application context requires careful consideration.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access to Git repositories, Git-related features, or sensitive data managed by Git.

        *   **2.1.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure access control to Git repositories or Git-related features [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of proper access control mechanisms for Git repositories or application features that interact with Git. This could be due to misinterpreting Git's security model or simply failing to implement adequate authorization checks in the application.
            *   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to Git repositories and potentially sensitive data or application functionality. Attackers can read, modify, or delete code and data, potentially leading to a full compromise.

    *   **2.2. Information Disclosure through Git Metadata or Objects [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might not fully understand the implications of Git's history, object storage, and metadata, potentially leading to unintentional information disclosure. Pro Git explains these concepts, but developers need to be aware of the security implications in their application context.
        *   **Impact:**  Primarily information disclosure, but can be severe depending on the sensitivity of the leaked information.

        *   **2.2.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Accidental exposure of sensitive data committed to Git history [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Developers accidentally commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys, secrets) to the Git repository history. Even if this data is later removed from the latest commit, it remains in the Git history and can be accessed by anyone with repository access. Pro Git might mention best practices like `.gitignore`, but developers need to be diligent.
            *   **Impact:** **Medium** to **High**.  Disclosure of sensitive credentials or confidential information stored in Git history. Attackers can use leaked credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
