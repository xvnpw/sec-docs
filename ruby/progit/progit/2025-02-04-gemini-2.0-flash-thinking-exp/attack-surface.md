# Attack Surface Analysis for progit/progit

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious Javascript or HTML code injected into Markdown content, which can be executed in a user's browser when the content is rendered by a vulnerable application or website.
    *   **Pro Git Contribution:** The Pro Git book is authored in Markdown. If platforms rendering this content lack proper sanitization, they become vulnerable to XSS if malicious Markdown is merged into the Pro Git repository. The repository's content *is* the source of this potential vulnerability for rendering platforms.
    *   **Example:** A contributor submits a pull request containing Markdown like `[Click here](javascript:alert('XSS'))` within a chapter. If merged and rendered unsafely, users viewing this chapter on a vulnerable website will execute the Javascript.
    *   **Impact:** User browser compromise, session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites for users accessing rendered book content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if rendering platform is vulnerable).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Rendering Platform Developers using Pro Git content):**
            *   **Mandatory Markdown Sanitization:** Implement robust Markdown sanitization using libraries like Bleach or DOMPurify *before* rendering Pro Git content on any website or application. This must strip or escape potentially harmful HTML and Javascript.
            *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Deploy a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of any XSS vulnerabilities that might bypass sanitization.
            *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Markdown rendering and sanitization libraries up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   **Users (Pro Git Repository Maintainers):**
            *   **Rigorous Pull Request Review:** Implement a *mandatory* and thorough pull request review process specifically focused on security. Reviewers must be trained to identify and reject any Markdown code that could potentially be used for XSS attacks (suspicious links, image tags, unusual HTML/Javascript-like syntax).
            *   **Automated Security Checks (if feasible):** Explore and implement automated tools that can scan pull requests for potential XSS vectors in Markdown content before merging.

## Attack Surface: [Account Compromise of Maintainers](./attack_surfaces/account_compromise_of_maintainers.md)

**Description:** Compromise of GitHub accounts belonging to Pro Git repository maintainers, granting attackers write access to the repository.
    *   **Pro Git Contribution:** The security of the Pro Git repository *directly depends* on the security of its maintainer accounts. Compromise of these accounts is a direct pathway to manipulating the repository's content and integrity.
    *   **Example:** An attacker successfully phishes the credentials of a Pro Git maintainer. Using these compromised credentials, the attacker directly pushes malicious commits to the `main` branch, merges harmful pull requests without review, or alters repository settings to inject malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Full repository compromise, injection of malicious content into the Pro Git book (potentially including XSS or misleading information at the source), repository defacement, long-term damage to the project's reputation and user trust. This can affect *all users* of the Pro Git book.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Pro Git Repository Maintainers):**
            *   **Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Mandate and strictly enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for *all* maintainer accounts with write access to the Pro Git repository. This is the most critical mitigation.
            *   **Strong Password Practices:**  Maintainers must use strong, unique passwords and avoid password reuse across different online services. Password managers should be encouraged.
            *   **Phishing Awareness Training:** Conduct regular security awareness training for all maintainers, specifically focusing on phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and how to identify and avoid them.
            *   **Regular Account Activity Monitoring:** Periodically review account activity logs for maintainer accounts to detect any suspicious logins or actions that might indicate compromise.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant write access only to necessary maintainers and limit permissions where possible. Regularly review and prune access lists.
        *   **Users (GitHub Platform Users - General Best Practice):**
            *   While users cannot directly mitigate maintainer account compromise for Pro Git, general best practices for GitHub users include enabling 2FA on their own accounts and being aware of phishing risks. This contributes to a more secure overall GitHub ecosystem.
