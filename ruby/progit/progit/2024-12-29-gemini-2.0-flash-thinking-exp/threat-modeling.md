* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack - Malicious Content Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `progit/progit` repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in GitHub's infrastructure). They then modify the content within the repository, such as injecting malicious JavaScript into Markdown files or replacing images with malicious ones. When the application fetches this compromised content, it unknowingly serves the malicious content to its users.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript embedded in the Markdown can execute in users' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, or performing other actions on their behalf.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Malicious images could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image rendering libraries or browser plugins, potentially leading to malware installation on user devices.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Malicious scripts could attempt to exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's browser or the application's context.
    * **Which https://github.com/progit/progit component is affected:**
        * Fetched Markdown Files (.md)
        * Images (.png, .jpg, etc.)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify Repository Source:** Ensure the application is configured to fetch content exclusively from the official `progit/progit` repository on GitHub.
        * **Use Specific Commit Hashes/Tags:** Instead of relying on the `main` branch or latest tag, pin the application to a specific, verified commit hash or tag of the `progit/progit` repository. This provides a more stable and predictable source.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of scripts that might be included in the fetched content. This can help prevent XSS attacks.
        * **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** If the application processes the Markdown content before displaying it, ensure proper sanitization and encoding to neutralize any potentially malicious scripts or HTML.
        * **Regularly Monitor Upstream Repository:** Keep an eye on the `progit/progit` repository for any unexpected changes or commits.

* **Threat:** Content Injection via Compromised Contributor Account
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the GitHub account of a contributor to the `progit/progit` repository. They then use this compromised account to inject malicious content through a pull request that might be merged before being thoroughly reviewed or detected.
    * **Impact:** Similar to the Supply Chain Attack, this could lead to XSS, malware distribution, or information disclosure. The impact window might be shorter if the malicious content is quickly identified and removed.
    * **Which https://github.com/progit/progit component is affected:**
        * Fetched Markdown Files (.md)
        * Images (.png, .jpg, etc.)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use Considerations:** Be aware that fetching the latest version of the repository might include unreviewed changes. Consider fetching from specific, trusted commits or tags.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** As mentioned before, CSP can mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**  Crucial for preventing the execution of malicious content.
        * **Community Monitoring (Indirect):** While not directly controlled by the application developers, the active community around `progit/progit` might help in quickly identifying and reporting suspicious changes.
