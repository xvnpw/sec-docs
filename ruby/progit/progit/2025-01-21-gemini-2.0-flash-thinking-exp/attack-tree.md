# Attack Tree Analysis for progit/progit

Objective: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `progit/progit` project's content or its processing by the application.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR
    *   *** Exploit Malicious Content Injection in progit/progit ***
        *   AND
            *   Attacker Gains Write Access to progit/progit Repository (Less Likely - Focus on Exploiting Existing Content)
            *   [CRITICAL] Application Processes and Displays Injected Malicious Content
    *   *** [CRITICAL] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown/HTML Injection ***
        *   AND
            *   Attacker Inserts Malicious JavaScript/HTML in progit/progit content (e.g., via a compromised contributor account or by exploiting a vulnerability in the Git platform itself - less likely but possible)
            *   [CRITICAL] Application renders this content in a user's browser without proper sanitization
    *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Processing of progit/progit Content
        *   AND
            *   progit/progit Content Contains Unexpected or Complex Structures
            *   [CRITICAL] Application's Parsing/Rendering Logic Fails or Behaves Unexpectedly
```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Malicious Content Injection in progit/progit:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_malicious_content_injection_in_progitprogit.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces malicious content directly into the `progit/progit` repository.
    *   **Attacker Gains Write Access to progit/progit Repository (Less Likely - Focus on Exploiting Existing Content):**
        *   **Description:**  While less likely, an attacker could compromise a maintainer's account or exploit a vulnerability in the Git platform hosting the repository to gain write access. This allows them to directly modify the content of the book.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Application Processes and Displays Injected Malicious Content:**
        *   **Description:**  The application fetches content from the compromised `progit/progit` repository. If this content contains malicious scripts or HTML, and the application doesn't properly sanitize it before displaying it to users, the malicious code will be executed in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown/HTML Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdownhtml_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the application's failure to sanitize Markdown or HTML content from `progit/progit`, injecting malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers.
    *   **Attacker Inserts Malicious JavaScript/HTML in progit/progit content (e.g., via a compromised contributor account or by exploiting a vulnerability in the Git platform itself - less likely but possible):**
        *   **Description:**  Similar to the previous point, an attacker with write access to the repository can insert malicious JavaScript or HTML code directly into the Markdown files of the `progit/progit` book.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Application renders this content in a user's browser without proper sanitization:**
        *   **Description:** The application fetches the `progit/progit` content containing the malicious script. Without proper sanitization, the browser interprets and executes this script when the application renders the page. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Processing of progit/progit Content:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application's_processing_of_progitprogit_content.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's logic for parsing or rendering the content from `progit/progit` contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **progit/progit Content Contains Unexpected or Complex Structures:**
        *   **Description:** The `progit/progit` content, while generally well-structured, might contain edge cases, deeply nested elements, or unusually large elements that the application's parsing or rendering logic isn't designed to handle efficiently or securely.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Application's Parsing/Rendering Logic Fails or Behaves Unexpectedly:**
        *   **Description:**  When the application encounters these unexpected or complex structures, its parsing or rendering logic might fail, crash, or exhibit unexpected behavior. This could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) if the rendering consumes excessive resources, or potentially other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the failure. For example, a vulnerability in the Markdown parsing library could be triggered by specific input, leading to code execution or information disclosure.
