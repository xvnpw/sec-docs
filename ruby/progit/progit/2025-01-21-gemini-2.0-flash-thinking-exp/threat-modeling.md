# Threat Model Analysis for progit/progit

## Threat: [Content Injection via Compromised Repository](./threats/content_injection_via_compromised_repository.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `progit/progit` repository and modifies the book's content. This could involve injecting malicious scripts into text, altering code examples to include vulnerabilities, or inserting misleading information.
    * **How:** This could happen through compromised developer accounts, vulnerabilities in the GitHub platform itself, or other security breaches affecting the repository.
* **Impact:**
    * Users of the application displaying this compromised content could be victims of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious scripts are injected.
    * Users might follow insecure practices based on altered or misleading information, leading to security vulnerabilities in their own systems or workflows.
    * The application's reputation could be damaged by displaying untrusted or harmful content.
* **Affected Component:**
    * Textual content (chapters, sections, paragraphs)
    * Code examples
    * Links within the book
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly monitor the `progit/progit` repository's commit history for unexpected changes.
    * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict directives to prevent the execution of unexpected scripts if displaying content directly.
    * If displaying code examples, render them in a way that prevents execution (e.g., as plain text or within a code block with appropriate syntax highlighting but no execution).
    * Consider using a specific, trusted tag or commit hash of the `progit/progit` repository instead of always using the latest version.
    * Implement integrity checks (e.g., using subresource integrity for fetched content, though less applicable here as it's not a typical web resource).
