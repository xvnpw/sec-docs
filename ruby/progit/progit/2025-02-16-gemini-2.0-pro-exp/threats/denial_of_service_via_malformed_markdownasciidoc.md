# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service via Malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc (progit)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of the "Denial of Service via Malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc" threat as it applies to the `progit` project.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within the `progit` codebase and its dependencies that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies and recommend concrete implementation steps.
*   Provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent this type of attack.
*   Determine the best testing strategies to validate the mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **`progit` Repository Content:**  The Markdown, AsciiDoc, and image files within the `progit` repository itself (https://github.com/progit/progit).  This is the *primary* attack surface, as the threat model specifies the attacker has compromised the repository.
*   **Markdown/AsciiDoc Parsers:**  The libraries and tools used to parse and render Markdown and AsciiDoc content *when displaying the `progit` content*.  This includes any web servers, static site generators, or other applications that process the `progit` files.  We need to identify *which* parsers are used in the various contexts where `progit` is displayed.
*   **Image Processing:**  The libraries and tools used to handle images within the `progit` repository, especially if resizing or other transformations are performed.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  The server infrastructure (operating system, web server, etc.) where the `progit` content is hosted and served.  This is important for understanding resource limits and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Excludes:**  This analysis *does not* cover attacks that require compromising the *user's* machine or browser.  It focuses on attacks against the server-side infrastructure serving the `progit` content.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `progit` repository content for potentially problematic patterns (e.g., deeply nested lists, large images).  Examine any scripts or tools used to process the content.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identify all Markdown/AsciiDoc parsing and image processing libraries used.  Research known vulnerabilities and limitations of these libraries.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Create malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc documents and image files to test the resilience of the parsing and rendering process.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage during the processing of both normal and malformed content.
    *   **Load Testing:**  Simulate multiple concurrent requests to assess the impact of the attack under load.
4.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisit the original threat model to ensure all aspects of the threat are addressed.
5.  **Documentation Review:**  Examine any existing documentation related to security, deployment, and content processing for the `progit` project.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through several attack vectors, all requiring prior compromise of the `progit` repository:

*   **Deeply Nested Structures:**  Creating Markdown or AsciiDoc documents with excessively nested lists, blockquotes, or other structures.  This can cause exponential growth in the parser's internal data structures, leading to memory exhaustion.  Example (Markdown):
    ```markdown
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    ```
    This could be hundreds or thousands of levels deep.

*   **Excessively Large Images:**  Including extremely large image files (in terms of dimensions or file size) in the repository.  If the application attempts to resize or process these images, it can consume significant resources.

*   **Resource-Intensive Markdown/AsciiDoc Features:**  Exploiting features of the Markdown or AsciiDoc syntax that are known to be computationally expensive.  This depends heavily on the specific parser used.  For example, some parsers might have performance issues with complex tables or regular expressions within the document.

*   **Algorithmic Complexity Attacks:**  Crafting input that triggers worst-case performance scenarios in the parsing algorithm.  This is a more sophisticated attack that requires a deep understanding of the parser's implementation.

### 2.2 Vulnerable Components and Dependencies

*   **Markdown Parsers:**  We need to identify *exactly* which Markdown parser(s) are used.  Common examples include:
    *   **CommonMark implementations (e.g., `cmark`, `markdown-it`)**
    *   **Kramdown**
    *   **Redcarpet**
    *   **Pandoc**
    *   **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) specific parsers**

    Each parser has its own strengths and weaknesses.  We need to research known vulnerabilities and performance limitations for the specific parser(s) in use.

*   **AsciiDoc Parsers:**  Similarly, we need to identify the AsciiDoc parser(s):
    *   **Asciidoctor (Ruby)** - This is the most likely candidate, given the project's history.
    *   **Asciidoctor.js** - A JavaScript port of Asciidoctor.

*   **Image Processing Libraries:**  If images are processed (resized, compressed, etc.), we need to identify the libraries used:
    *   **ImageMagick**
    *   **GraphicsMagick**
    *   **libvips**
    *   **Pillow (Python)**

    These libraries can also be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks if presented with malicious image files.

*   **Web Server:**  The web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) can be configured to limit request sizes and connection timeouts, which can help mitigate some aspects of this attack.

* **Static Site Generator:** If a static site generator is used (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo), its configuration and plugins should be reviewed.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Implementation

Let's break down the proposed mitigation strategies and provide concrete implementation steps:

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **File Size Limits:**  Implement a hard limit on the size of files fetched from the repository.  This can be done at the web server level (e.g., `LimitRequestBody` in Apache, `client_max_body_size` in Nginx) or within the application logic that fetches the files.  A reasonable limit (e.g., 1MB for Markdown/AsciiDoc files, 10MB for images) should be determined based on the expected content.
    *   **Nested Structure Limits:**  This is the *most crucial* mitigation for the deeply nested structure attack.  The application logic that parses the Markdown/AsciiDoc content *must* include a check for excessive nesting depth.  This can be implemented by:
        *   **Modifying the Parser:**  If possible, modify the parser itself to reject documents with excessive nesting.  This is the most robust solution, but may require significant effort.
        *   **Pre-parsing Check:**  Implement a simple pre-parsing step that scans the document for potentially problematic patterns (e.g., long sequences of `-` or `>` characters) and rejects the document if a threshold is exceeded.  This is a less robust, but easier to implement, solution.
        *   **Parser Configuration:** Some parsers may have built-in options to limit nesting depth.  Check the parser's documentation.
    *   **Image Dimension Limits:** If images are processed, limit the maximum dimensions (width and height) of images that will be processed.  This prevents attacks that use extremely large images.

*   **Resource Limits:**
    *   **CPU Time Limits:**  Use operating system features (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) or web server configurations (e.g., `RLimitCPU` in Apache) to limit the CPU time that can be used by the process handling the request.
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Similarly, use `ulimit` or web server configurations (e.g., `RLimitMEM` in Apache) to limit the memory that can be used.  Consider using a separate process or container for content processing with its own resource limits.
    *   **Disk Space Limits:**  Use disk quotas or other mechanisms to limit the amount of disk space that can be used by the application.

*   **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   **Background Jobs:**  Use a background job queue (e.g., Sidekiq, Resque, Celery) to process the Markdown/AsciiDoc content and image transformations asynchronously.  This prevents a single malicious request from blocking the main application thread.
    *   **Message Queues:**  Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple the request handling from the content processing.

*   **Pre-processing:**
    *   **Static Site Generation:**  If possible, pre-render the `progit` content into static HTML files.  This eliminates the need for dynamic parsing and rendering on each request, significantly reducing the attack surface.  This is likely the *best* long-term solution for `progit`.
    *   **Caching:**  Cache the rendered HTML output to reduce the load on the server.

*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Web Server Level:**  Use web server modules (e.g., `mod_ratelimit` in Apache, `limit_req` in Nginx) to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
    *   **Application Level:**  Implement rate limiting within the application logic to limit the frequency with which the content is fetched or processed.

### 2.4 Testing Strategies

Thorough testing is crucial to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations:

*   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer (e.g., `zzuf`, `radamsa`) to generate malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc documents and image files.  Feed these files to the application and monitor its behavior.
*   **Regression Testing:**  Ensure that the mitigations do not introduce any regressions or break existing functionality.
*   **Performance Testing:**  Measure the performance impact of the mitigations.  Ensure that they do not significantly degrade the performance of the application under normal load.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider engaging a security professional to perform penetration testing to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Nested Structure Limits:** Implement robust checks for excessively nested Markdown/AsciiDoc structures. This is the most critical mitigation.
2.  **Implement File Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of files fetched from the repository.
3.  **Pre-render Content (Static Site Generation):**  Strongly consider migrating to a static site generation approach to eliminate dynamic parsing on each request. This is the most effective long-term solution.
4.  **Asynchronous Processing:**  Use background jobs or message queues to process content asynchronously.
5.  **Resource Limits:**  Configure CPU, memory, and disk space limits at the operating system and web server levels.
6.  **Thorough Testing:**  Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including fuzzing, regression testing, and performance testing.
7.  **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update all dependencies (Markdown/AsciiDoc parsers, image processing libraries, web server, etc.) to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
8.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and infrastructure.
9. **Identify specific parser:** Determine which specific Markdown and AsciiDoc parsers are used in *all* contexts where `progit` is displayed (website, documentation builds, etc.).

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Denial of Service via Malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc" threat and provides actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk. By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly improve the security and resilience of the `progit` project.
