## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious Content into Generated Book [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_content_into_generated_book__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1. Modify AsciiDoc Source Files [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   *Description:* This is the foundational step for injecting malicious content. The attacker needs to alter the source AsciiDoc files that make up the Pro Git book.
    *   *Why Critical:*  Direct modification of the source is the most straightforward way to inject malicious content.

    *   **1.1.1. Gain Unauthorized Write Access to Repository [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker needs write access to the Git repository to modify the source files.
        *   *Why High-Risk:*  This is a common attack vector, leveraging various methods to gain access.

        *   **1.1.1.1. Compromise Developer Credentials (Phishing, Keylogger, etc.) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   *Description:* The attacker obtains valid developer credentials through social engineering (phishing), malware (keyloggers, credential stealers), or other means.
            *   *Why Critical/High-Risk:*  Credential compromise is a frequent and effective attack, often requiring only moderate technical skill.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

    *   **1.1.2. Submit Malicious Pull Request [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker submits a pull request containing malicious changes to the AsciiDoc source files.
        *   *Why High-Risk:*  Relies on bypassing the code review process, which is a common vulnerability.

        *   **1.1.2.1. Bypass Code Review Process (Social Engineering, Inattentive Reviewer) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   *Description:* The attacker uses social engineering to convince reviewers to approve the malicious pull request, or the reviewers are inattentive and miss the malicious code.
            *   *Why Critical/High-Risk:*  Code review is a crucial defense, but it's often bypassed due to human error or social engineering.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **1.2. Exploit AsciiDoc Processor Vulnerabilities**
    *   **1.2.1.1. Identify and Exploit Asciidoctor Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in the Asciidoctor processor (or a used extension) to inject malicious content or execute code.
        *   *Why Critical:*  While less likely than source code modification, a successful exploit could have a high impact.
        *   *Likelihood:* Very Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard

*   **1.3. Exploit Build Script Vulnerabilities**
    *   **1.3.1. Inject Malicious Commands into Makefile/Rakefile [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker modifies the build scripts (Makefile, Rakefile, etc.) to execute arbitrary commands during the build process. This could inject malicious content into the output or compromise the build server.
        *   *Why Critical:* Build scripts often run with elevated privileges, making them a high-value target.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) during Build [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__during_build__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1. Submit Extremely Large/Complex AsciiDoc Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker submits specially crafted AsciiDoc files designed to consume excessive resources during processing.
    *   *Why High-Risk:*  Easy to execute and can disrupt the build process.

    *   **2.1.1. Cause Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) on Build Server [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker's input causes the build server to run out of CPU or memory, preventing the build from completing.
        *   *Why Critical/High-Risk:*  This is a simple and effective DoS attack.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Gain Control of Build Server](./attack_tree_paths/3__gain_control_of_build_server.md)

*   **3.1. Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Asciidoctor or Dependencies**
    *   **3.1.1. Identify and Exploit a Zero-Day RCE [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerability in Asciidoctor or one of its dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the build server.
        *   *Why Critical:*  A successful RCE would give the attacker complete control of the build server.
        *   *Likelihood:* Very Low
        *   *Impact:* Very High
        *   *Effort:* Very High
        *   *Skill Level:* Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
