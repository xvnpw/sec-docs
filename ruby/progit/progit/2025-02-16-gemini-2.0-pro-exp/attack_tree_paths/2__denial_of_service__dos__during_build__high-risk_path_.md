Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Denial of Service via AsciiDoc Processing

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the identified attack path (Denial of Service during Build via Extremely Large/Complex AsciiDoc Files), understand its potential impact, identify vulnerabilities in the `progit/progit` application that could be exploited, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the application's resilience against this specific type of DoS attack.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack path:

**Attack Tree Path:** 2. Denial of Service (DoS) during Build -> 2.1. Submit Extremely Large/Complex AsciiDoc Files -> 2.1.1. Cause Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) on Build Server

The analysis will consider:

*   The AsciiDoc processing pipeline within `progit/progit` (as far as publicly available information allows, without direct access to the proprietary codebase).  We'll assume it uses a standard Asciidoctor implementation.
*   The build server environment (generic assumptions will be made, such as a Linux-based server with limited resources).
*   Potential attack vectors related to AsciiDoc features (e.g., includes, macros, deeply nested structures).
*   Existing security controls (if any) that might mitigate or exacerbate the attack.
*   Detection and monitoring capabilities.

This analysis will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors outside the specified path.
*   Network-level DoS attacks.
*   Attacks targeting the underlying operating system or infrastructure (beyond the build server's resource limits).
*   Attacks that require authenticated access.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Refine the understanding of the attacker's capabilities, motivations, and potential attack techniques.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific weaknesses in the `progit/progit` AsciiDoc processing pipeline that could be exploited. This will involve researching known Asciidoctor vulnerabilities and common resource exhaustion patterns.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential impact of a successful attack on the application and its users.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable, and prioritized mitigation techniques to address the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Detection and Monitoring Recommendations:**  Suggest methods for detecting and monitoring attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
6.  **Documentation:**  Present the findings in a clear and concise report (this document).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 2.1. Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker is likely an unauthenticated user with basic knowledge of AsciiDoc syntax.  They may be motivated by disruption, competition, or simply to test the system's limits.  They do not require sophisticated tools or deep technical expertise.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker submits a crafted AsciiDoc file through the application's input mechanism (e.g., a web form, API endpoint, or Git repository).
*   **Attack Techniques:** The attacker could employ several techniques, potentially in combination:
    *   **Extremely Large Files:**  Submitting a file with millions of lines of simple text.
    *   **Deeply Nested Structures:**  Creating AsciiDoc documents with excessive nesting of blocks, lists, or tables.
    *   **Include Abuse:**  Using the `include::` directive to recursively include files, potentially creating an infinite loop or referencing a very large number of files.
    *   **Macro Abuse:**  Defining macros that expand to large amounts of text or perform computationally expensive operations.
    *   **Attribute Abuse:** Defining a large number of attributes, or attributes with very long values.
    *   **Image/Resource Loading:**  Including references to numerous or very large external resources (images, videos, etc.) that the processor attempts to load.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis

Based on the `progit/progit` project using Asciidoctor, we can identify potential vulnerabilities:

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application may not adequately validate the size, complexity, or structure of submitted AsciiDoc files before processing them.  This is the *primary* vulnerability.
*   **Unbounded Resource Allocation:**  Asciidoctor, by default, may not have strict limits on memory usage or processing time.  This allows an attacker to consume excessive resources.
*   **Recursive Include Vulnerability:**  If the application doesn't properly handle circular includes or limit the depth of include directives, an attacker could create an infinite loop, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Unsafe Macro Handling:**  If custom macros are allowed and not properly sandboxed, they could be used to execute arbitrary code or consume excessive resources.
* **Lack of Timeouts:** The build process might not have appropriate timeouts, allowing a single malicious file to stall the entire build pipeline indefinitely.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

*   **Build Server Unavailability:**  The primary impact is the build server becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate builds from completing.
*   **Service Disruption:**  This can lead to delays in software releases, updates, and deployments.
*   **Potential Data Loss:**  If the build server crashes, in-progress builds and potentially cached data could be lost.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Frequent build failures can damage the project's reputation and erode user trust.
* **Financial impact:** If build server is hosted on cloud, it can lead to increased costs.
*   **Impact Quantification:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  It's relatively easy to craft malicious AsciiDoc files.
    *   **Impact:** Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  While not catastrophic, it disrupts the development workflow.
    *   **Effort:** Low (as stated in the original attack tree).  Requires minimal effort to create and submit a malicious file.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (as stated in the original attack tree).  Basic AsciiDoc knowledge is sufficient.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (as stated in the original attack tree).  Resource exhaustion is easily observable.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategy Development

The following mitigation strategies are recommended, prioritized by their effectiveness and ease of implementation:

1.  **Input Validation (High Priority):**
    *   **Maximum File Size:**  Implement a strict limit on the size of uploaded AsciiDoc files.  This is the most crucial and straightforward defense.  The limit should be based on the expected size of legitimate files.
    *   **Maximum Line Count:** Limit the total number of lines in an AsciiDoc file.
    *   **Maximum Include Depth:**  Limit the number of nested `include::` directives.  A depth of 3-5 is usually sufficient for legitimate use cases.
    *   **Circular Include Detection:**  Implement checks to prevent circular includes (A includes B, B includes A).
    *   **Whitelisted/Blacklisted Directives:**  Consider restricting the use of certain AsciiDoc directives (e.g., `include::`) or attributes if they are not essential for the application's functionality.  A whitelist approach (allowing only known-safe directives) is generally more secure than a blacklist.
    * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters or sequences.

2.  **Resource Limits (High Priority):**
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Configure Asciidoctor (or the build environment) to limit the maximum amount of memory that can be used during AsciiDoc processing.  This can be done through JVM options (if AsciidoctorJ is used) or container resource limits (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
    *   **CPU Time Limits:**  Set a maximum CPU time limit for AsciiDoc processing.  This prevents a single file from monopolizing the CPU for an extended period.  This can often be achieved using tools like `ulimit` on Linux.
    *   **Process Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for the entire build process and individual steps (including AsciiDoc processing).  If a process exceeds the timeout, it should be terminated.

3.  **Secure Configuration (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Disable Unsafe Features:**  If possible, disable Asciidoctor features that are not strictly necessary, such as custom macros or external resource loading.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  If custom macros are required, explore sandboxing techniques to isolate their execution and prevent them from accessing sensitive resources or executing arbitrary code.

4.  **Rate Limiting (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Limit Upload Frequency:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from submitting a large number of files in a short period.  This can be done at the application level or using a web application firewall (WAF).

5.  **Code Review and Testing (Ongoing):**
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the AsciiDoc processing pipeline.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing techniques to automatically generate a large number of malformed or unusual AsciiDoc inputs and test the application's resilience.

### 2.5. Detection and Monitoring Recommendations

*   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O on the build server.  Alert on unusually high resource consumption.
*   **Build Time Monitoring:**  Track the time taken for AsciiDoc processing and the overall build process.  Alert on unusually long build times.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Log all AsciiDoc processing events, including file sizes, include directives, and any errors or warnings.  Analyze these logs for suspicious patterns.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Consider using an IDS to detect and block malicious AsciiDoc files based on known attack patterns.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate logs and alerts into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.

### 2.6. Conclusion
This deep analysis has identified a significant vulnerability in the `progit/progit` application related to AsciiDoc processing. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful Denial-of-Service attack. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial to maintain a robust security posture. The most important mitigations are input validation (limiting file size, line count, and include depth) and resource limits (memory and CPU time limits). These should be implemented as a priority.
