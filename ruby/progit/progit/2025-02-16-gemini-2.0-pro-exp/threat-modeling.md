# Threat Model Analysis for progit/progit

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Repository Compromise](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_repository_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `progit/progit` repository (or a commonly used mirror) and modifies the book's content. They could subtly alter instructions to include malicious commands, insert links to phishing sites disguised as legitimate resources, or inject code snippets that appear to be examples but are actually exploits. The attacker might rewrite Git history to make the changes appear older and less suspicious.
*   **Impact:** Users following the compromised instructions could have their systems compromised, be redirected to malicious websites, or unknowingly execute harmful code. This could lead to data breaches, malware infections, or loss of control over their systems.
*   **Affected `progit` Component:** All content within the repository is potentially affected, including Markdown/AsciiDoc files, images, and any included scripts (though the scripts are not intended for execution by users).  Specific chapters on security, command-line usage, or scripting are higher-risk targets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Git Integrity Verification:** *Crucially*, verify the *entire* history of the repository using Git's commit hashes (and ideally signed commits/tags if available).  Do *not* simply trust the latest commit.  Use `git log --pretty=fuller` and examine committer and author dates.  Look for discrepancies.  Use `git fsck --full` to check for repository corruption.
    *   **Pin to a Specific Commit:** Do not automatically update to the latest version.  Pin the application to a known-good commit hash and manually review all changes before updating.
    *   **Use a Trusted Source:** Fetch the repository directly from the official `progit/progit` repository on GitHub. Avoid untrusted mirrors or proxies.
    *   **Regular Content Audits:** Periodically compare the fetched content against a known-good baseline to detect any unauthorized modifications.  Automate this process if possible.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malformed Markdown/AsciiDoc](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malformed_markdownasciidoc.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed Markdown or AsciiDoc document (or modifies an existing one *within `progit`*) that contains deeply nested structures, excessively large images, or other features that consume excessive resources when parsed by the application's rendering engine. This requires the attacker to have compromised the repository.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, or disk space). This prevents legitimate users from accessing the `progit` content.
*   **Affected `progit` Component:** Primarily the Markdown/AsciiDoc files within the repository.  Large image files could also contribute to this threat.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Limit the size of files fetched from the repository.  Implement checks for excessively nested Markdown/AsciiDoc structures.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set strict limits on the amount of CPU time, memory, and disk space that can be used to process the `progit` content.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Process the content in a background thread or separate process to avoid blocking the main application thread.
    *   **Pre-processing:** If possible, pre-process the Markdown/AsciiDoc content into a more efficient format (e.g., pre-rendered HTML) before serving it to users. This reduces the load on the application's rendering engine.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency with which the application fetches or processes the content.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rendered Content (Originating from Repository Compromise)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rendered_content__originating_from_repository_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, *after compromising the `progit` repository*, modifies the Markdown/AsciiDoc content to include malicious JavaScript that bypasses the application's Markdown/AsciiDoc parser's sanitization (or exploits a vulnerability in the parser). This leverages the compromised repository as the *source* of the XSS attack.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Affected `progit` Component:** Any Markdown/AsciiDoc content within the `progit` repository that is rendered into HTML by the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a Secure Markdown/AsciiDoc Parser:** Choose a parser with a strong security track record and keep it updated to the latest version. Research known vulnerabilities and mitigations for the chosen parser.
    *   **Strict Output Encoding:** Ensure that all output from the parser is properly HTML-encoded to prevent script injection.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to restrict the sources of scripts, styles, and other resources. This limits the impact of any successful XSS injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization (If Applicable):** If the application allows user input that interacts with the rendered content, thoroughly sanitize that input to prevent XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Include the Markdown/AsciiDoc rendering process in regular security audits and penetration testing.
    * **Git Integrity Verification:** *Crucially*, verify the *entire* history of the repository using Git's commit hashes (and ideally signed commits/tags if available). Do *not* simply trust the latest commit. Use `git log --pretty=fuller` and examine committer and author dates. Look for discrepancies. Use `git fsck --full` to check for repository corruption.
    * **Pin to a Specific Commit:** Do not automatically update to the latest version. Pin the application to a known-good commit hash and manually review all changes before updating.
