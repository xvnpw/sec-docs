## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using OpenProject - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the application through exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the OpenProject instance.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* ***Exploit OpenProject Vulnerabilities***
    * **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws**
        * **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms**
            * ***Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)***
        * **Elevate Privileges**
            * ***Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)***
    * **Exploit Injection Flaws**
        * **SQL Injection**
            * ***Inject Malicious SQL Queries via OpenProject Input Fields***
    * ***Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities***
        * Exploit Known RCE Vulnerabilities in OpenProject or its Dependencies (e.g., CVEs)
* **Abuse OpenProject Features/Functionality**
    * **Social Engineering targeting OpenProject Users**
        * Phishing for Credentials or Access
* ***Exploit OpenProject Dependencies***
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries or Frameworks

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Critical Node: Exploit OpenProject Vulnerabilities**
    * This represents a broad category of attacks that directly target weaknesses in the OpenProject application code or its configuration. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws**
    * This path focuses on bypassing or subverting OpenProject's mechanisms for verifying user identity and controlling access to resources.

    * **Critical Node: Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)**
        * Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in OpenProject's authentication logic to bypass login procedures without valid credentials. This often involves exploiting flaws in password reset mechanisms, session management, or two-factor authentication.

    * **High-Risk Path: Elevate Privileges**
        * After gaining initial access with limited privileges, attackers attempt to escalate their access level to gain control over more sensitive data or functionalities.

        * **Critical Node: Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)**
            * Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities that allow them to gain administrative or higher-level access within OpenProject. This could involve manipulating user roles or exploiting flaws in permission checks.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Injection Flaws**
    * This path involves injecting malicious code or commands into OpenProject through various input points.

    * **Critical Node: Inject Malicious SQL Queries via OpenProject Input Fields**
        * Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields within OpenProject (e.g., search bars, task descriptions) if the application doesn't properly sanitize user input. This allows them to interact directly with the underlying database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.

* **Critical Node: Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities**
    * This critical node represents vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server running OpenProject. This is a severe compromise as it grants the attacker full control over the server and the application.

    * **Attack Vector:** Exploit Known RCE Vulnerabilities in OpenProject or its Dependencies (e.g., CVEs)
        * Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in OpenProject's core code or its dependencies to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

* **High-Risk Path: Abuse OpenProject Features/Functionality - Social Engineering targeting OpenProject Users**
    * This path focuses on manipulating legitimate users of OpenProject to perform actions that compromise security.

    * **Attack Vector:** Phishing for Credentials or Access
        * Attackers use deceptive emails, messages, or websites that mimic legitimate OpenProject login pages to trick users into revealing their credentials. This allows the attacker to gain access using valid user accounts.

* **Critical Node: Exploit OpenProject Dependencies**
    * This critical node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries and frameworks that OpenProject relies on.

    * **Attack Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries or Frameworks
        * Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries and frameworks like Ruby on Rails or specific gems used by OpenProject. Successful exploitation can lead to various levels of compromise, including RCE.
