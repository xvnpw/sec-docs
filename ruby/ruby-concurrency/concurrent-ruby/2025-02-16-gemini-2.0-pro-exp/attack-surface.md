# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions.md)

*   **Description:** Unsynchronized access to shared resources by multiple threads, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior.
    *   **How `concurrent-ruby` Contributes:** Provides concurrency primitives (threads, actors, promises, etc.) that, if used incorrectly, *increase* the likelihood of race conditions. The library's core functionality enables concurrent execution, making race conditions possible.
    *   **Example:** Two threads concurrently modify a shared hash (without using `Concurrent::Map` or proper locking) using `concurrent-ruby`'s `Future`. One thread might add a key-value pair, while another removes a key-value pair, leading to an inconsistent state or a missing entry.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, security bypass (e.g., bypassing authorization checks), unexpected program termination.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (in many cases, can lead to complete compromise) to **High** (depending on the specific shared resource).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Atomics:** Employ `concurrent-ruby`'s `Atomic` types (e.g., `AtomicFixnum`, `AtomicBoolean`, `AtomicReference`) for *all* shared mutable data. Ensure all operations are truly atomic.
        *   **Use Synchronization Primitives:** Utilize `Mutex`, `ReadWriteLock`, `Semaphore`, and `Condition` appropriately to protect critical sections. Choose the most granular lock possible.
        *   **Immutable Data Structures:** Favor immutable data structures. If modification is needed, create a new copy.
        *   **Message Passing (Actors):** Use the Actor model (`Agent` in `concurrent-ruby`) to encapsulate state and communicate via messages, avoiding direct shared memory.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code for potential race conditions, focusing on shared variable access.
        *   **Stress Testing:** Use stress testing tools to expose race conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Deadlocks](./attack_surfaces/deadlocks.md)

*   **Description:** Two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
    *   **How `concurrent-ruby` Contributes:** Provides synchronization primitives (`Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `Channel`) that, if used incorrectly (e.g., creating circular dependencies), can directly lead to deadlocks.
    *   **Example:** Thread A acquires a `concurrent-ruby` `Mutex` for resource X and then tries to acquire a `concurrent-ruby` `Mutex` for resource Y. Simultaneously, Thread B acquires the `Mutex` for resource Y and then tries to acquire the `Mutex` for resource X. Both threads are now blocked indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:** Application freeze, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can completely halt application functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Lock Ordering:** Establish a strict global order for acquiring locks. If all threads always acquire locks in the same order, circular dependencies are impossible.
        *   **Timeouts:** Use `try_lock` with a timeout instead of `lock`. If a thread cannot acquire a lock within a specified time, it can back off.
        *   **Deadlock Detection Tools:** Employ tools that can detect deadlocks during development and testing.
        *   **Careful Design:** Design concurrent code to minimize the need for holding multiple locks simultaneously. Consider finer-grained locks or alternative concurrency patterns (e.g., message passing with `Agent`).
        *   **Avoid Nested Locking:** Minimize or eliminate nested locking.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Uncontrolled creation of threads or other concurrent resources, leading to system instability or crashes.
    *   **How `concurrent-ruby` Contributes:** Provides mechanisms for creating threads (e.g., `ThreadPoolExecutor`) and other concurrent objects (e.g., `Promise`, `Future`, `Channel`, `TimerTask`). Misuse *directly* leads to excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Example:** An application uses an unbounded `concurrent-ruby` `ThreadPoolExecutor` and receives a flood of requests. The executor creates a new thread for each request, exhausting system memory.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash, system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can render the application unusable).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Bounded Thread Pools:** Use bounded thread pools (e.g., `FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool` with appropriate maximum sizes).
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on the number of `Promise`, `Future`, `Channel`, and `TimerTask` objects.
        *   **Proper Resource Management:** Ensure that concurrent resources from `concurrent-ruby` are properly released when no longer needed (e.g., cancelling `TimerTask` instances, closing `Channel`s).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent overload.
        *   **Circuit Breakers:** Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, threads).
