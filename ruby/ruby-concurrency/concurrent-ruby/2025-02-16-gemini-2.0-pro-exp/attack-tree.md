## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents the most common attack surface. Developers often misuse concurrency features due to a lack of understanding or oversight, leading to vulnerabilities.  This is not a flaw in `concurrent-ruby` itself, but rather in how it's used.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code reviews focusing on concurrency aspects.
    *   Training developers on safe concurrency practices.
    *   Use of static analysis tools to detect potential issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a broad category encompassing various ways an attacker can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, file handles, network connections), leading to a denial-of-service.  It's a critical node because it's a common consequence of many concurrency-related misconfigurations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and rate limiting to prevent resource flooding.
    *   Use bounded resources (e.g., limited-size thread pools, connection pools).
    *   Monitor resource usage and set alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Implement timeouts for operations to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Attack Tree Path: [ThreadPool - Unbounded Queue (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/threadpool_-_unbounded_queue__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of tasks to a thread pool configured with an unbounded queue.  The queue grows indefinitely, consuming all available memory and leading to an application crash.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always use a bounded queue.**  Set a reasonable `max_queue` size for `ThreadPoolExecutor` and similar constructs.
    *   Monitor queue length and trigger alerts if it grows beyond a threshold.
    *   Consider using a thread pool that automatically rejects tasks when the queue is full (e.g., using a `RejectedExecutionHandler`).

## Attack Tree Path: [ThreadPool - Excessive Threads (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/threadpool_-_excessive_threads__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The application is configured to create a very large number of threads, either statically or dynamically.  This overwhelms the system's resources (CPU, memory), leading to slowdowns or a crash.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully tune the `max_threads` parameter of thread pools.  Consider the number of CPU cores and the nature of the tasks.
    *   Use a thread pool that dynamically adjusts the number of threads based on load, if available.
    *   Monitor the number of active threads and system resource usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion - General (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_-_general__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a catch-all for other ways an attacker might exhaust resources, such as creating many `Future` objects that never complete, or leaking resources within threads.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement comprehensive resource management.  Ensure that all acquired resources (files, sockets, database connections, etc.) are properly released, even in error conditions.
    *   Use `ensure` blocks or similar mechanisms to guarantee resource cleanup.
    *   Profile the application to identify resource leaks and bottlenecks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Future/Promise - Long-Running Operations Blocking Threads (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/futurepromise_-_long-running_operations_blocking_threads__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  A developer uses a `Future` or `Promise` to execute a long-running or blocking operation (e.g., a large file read, a slow network request) without using a dedicated thread pool or asynchronous I/O. This blocks a thread from the main thread pool, reducing the application's capacity to handle other requests, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use asynchronous I/O operations whenever possible within `Future` and `Promise` blocks.
        *   If blocking operations are unavoidable, offload them to a separate, dedicated thread pool with appropriate size limits.
        *   Implement timeouts to prevent a single long-running operation from blocking a thread indefinitely.
        *   Use non-blocking alternatives where available (e.g., non-blocking I/O libraries).
