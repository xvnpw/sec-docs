# Project Design Document: concurrent-ruby

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a comprehensive set of concurrency abstractions for the Ruby programming language.
    *   Improve the performance and responsiveness of Ruby applications by enabling parallel execution.
    *   Offer a variety of tools to manage shared data and avoid race conditions.
    *   Maintain backward compatibility and ease of integration with existing Ruby code.
    *   Provide well-documented and easy-to-understand APIs.
    *   Ensure thread safety and prevent common concurrency-related bugs.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Incorrect implementation of concurrency abstractions leading to data corruption or application crashes.
    *   Performance bottlenecks due to inefficient use of concurrency primitives.
    *   Difficulty in debugging and troubleshooting concurrency-related issues.
    *   Incompatibility with specific Ruby implementations or versions.
    *   Security vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of shared resources.
    *   Steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with concurrency concepts.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: The library itself is designed to provide safe concurrency abstractions, mitigating many common concurrency risks.
    *   security control: Extensive use of automated tests, including stress tests, to ensure the correctness and stability of the library. (Described in the project's README and test suite.)
    *   security control: Community review and contributions from experienced developers. (Visible through the GitHub repository's issue tracker and pull requests.)
    *   security control: Use of mutexes and other synchronization primitives to protect shared resources. (Implemented within the library's code.)

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: The library relies on the underlying Ruby implementation's threading model, which may have limitations or platform-specific behaviors.
    *   accepted risk: Developers are ultimately responsible for using the library correctly and avoiding race conditions in their application code.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service (DoS) if a large number of threads or processes are created without proper resource management.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., RuboCop with concurrency-related cops) into the development workflow to detect potential issues.
    *   security control: Provide clear guidelines and best practices for using the library securely in the documentation.
    *   security control: Consider adding runtime checks or assertions to detect unexpected behavior or misuse of the library.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as this is a library, not a service. Authentication would be handled by the application using the library.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable. Authorization would be handled by the application using the library.
    *   Input Validation: Not directly applicable, as the library primarily deals with concurrency primitives, not user input. Input validation should be handled by the application using the library.
    *   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the library does not handle cryptographic operations. Cryptography should be handled by dedicated libraries within the application.
    *   Data Protection: The library should ensure the integrity and consistency of shared data accessed concurrently. This is achieved through the use of appropriate synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, locks, and atomic variables.
    *   Error Handling: The library should handle errors and exceptions gracefully, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.

### BUILD

The build process for `concurrent-ruby` involves compiling the C extensions (if any), running tests, and packaging the gem.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Dev["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> Repo["Source Code Repository"]
    Repo -- "Triggers" --> CI["CI/CD Server\n(e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Checks out code" --> Workspace["Workspace"]
    Workspace -- "Runs tests" --> Rake["Rake (Test Task)"]
    Workspace -- "Compiles C extensions" --> Compiler["C Compiler"]
    Workspace -- "Packages gem" --> GemBuild["Rake (Gem Build Task)"]
    GemBuild -- "Creates" --> GemFile["concurrent-ruby.gem"]
    CI -- "Publishes" --> RubyGems["RubyGems.org"]

```

*   Security Controls in Build Process:

    *   Automated Testing: The test suite (run via Rake) includes comprehensive tests for concurrency-related behavior, helping to prevent regressions and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Static Analysis (Recommended): Integrating a static analysis tool like RuboCop (with concurrency-related cops) would further enhance code quality and security.
    *   Dependency Management: Bundler ensures that the correct versions of dependencies are used, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in external libraries.
    *   CI/CD Pipeline: Using a CI/CD server (like GitHub Actions) automates the build and test process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
    *   Limited Build Environment: The CI/CD environment should have limited access and permissions, minimizing the potential impact of a compromised build process.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Reliable and efficient execution of concurrent tasks in Ruby applications.
    *   Maintaining the integrity and consistency of shared data in multi-threaded environments.
    *   Providing a stable and well-tested library for developers to build upon.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The library itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, it is used to manage shared data within applications, which *could* be sensitive. The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the application using the library.  If the application using `concurrent-ruby` handles Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive information, then the library's correct functioning is critical to protecting that data.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific performance benchmarks or targets that the library should meet?
    *   Are there any specific Ruby implementations (MRI, JRuby, TruffleRuby) that need to be prioritized for compatibility?
    *   Are there any known limitations or edge cases in the underlying Ruby threading model that should be considered?
    *   What is the expected level of support and maintenance for the library?
    *   What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a robust and reliable concurrency library for Ruby. Performance is important, but correctness and stability are paramount.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using the library are responsible for understanding and mitigating concurrency risks in their own code. The library provides tools, but it cannot guarantee complete safety.
    *   DESIGN: The library will continue to evolve and add new features, but backward compatibility will be maintained whenever possible. The build process will remain automated and integrated with a CI/CD system. The deployment will be managed through RubyGems and Bundler.
