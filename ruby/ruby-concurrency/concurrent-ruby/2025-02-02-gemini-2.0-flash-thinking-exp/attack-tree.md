## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Unhandled Promise Rejection/Error Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__unhandled_promise_rejectionerror_path.md)

Leads to Information Leakage or Denial of Service due to common developer errors in asynchronous error handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Executor/ThreadPool Exhaustion Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__executorthreadpool_exhaustion_path.md)

Directly results in Denial of Service through task flooding, a relatively easy attack to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Atomicity and Data Races Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__atomicity_and_data_races_path.md)

Leads to Data Corruption or Logic Bypasses due to fundamental concurrency issues, often hard to detect and debug.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) in Asynchronous Operations Path](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__time-of-check_to_time-of-use__toctou__in_asynchronous_operations_path.md)

Exploits timing windows in asynchronous operations to bypass security checks or violate data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2. Inconsistent State due to Race Conditions in Application Logic Path](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2__inconsistent_state_due_to_race_conditions_in_application_logic_path.md)

Results in Security vulnerabilities due to flawed logic execution caused by race conditions in application-level code.
