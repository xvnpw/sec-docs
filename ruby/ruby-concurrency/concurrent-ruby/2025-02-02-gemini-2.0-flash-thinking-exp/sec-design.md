# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `concurrent-ruby`, provides a comprehensive and efficient concurrency library for the Ruby programming language. It aims to empower Ruby developers to build high-performance, responsive, and scalable applications by offering a rich set of concurrency abstractions and tools.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Primary goal is to provide a robust, reliable, and performant concurrency library for the Ruby ecosystem.
- Enable Ruby developers to easily implement concurrent and parallel patterns in their applications.
- Improve the overall performance and responsiveness of Ruby applications.
- Foster a strong community around concurrent programming in Ruby.
- Ensure long-term maintainability and evolution of the library to meet the changing needs of the Ruby community.

Business Risks:
- Risk of introducing vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using `concurrent-ruby`.
- Risk of performance regressions or bugs that could negatively impact the performance and stability of applications relying on the library.
- Risk of insufficient community support or maintainership leading to stagnation or abandonment of the project, making it unreliable for long-term use.
- Risk of incompatibility with future versions of the Ruby runtime environment, requiring significant rework or migration efforts for users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Development Model - The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for public scrutiny of the codebase and contributions from the community. This facilitates community-driven security reviews and vulnerability identification. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Code Review Process - All code changes are submitted via pull requests and are subject to review by project maintainers before being merged into the main branch. This helps to catch potential security flaws and coding errors. (Implemented: GitHub Pull Requests)
- security control: Unit and Integration Testing - The project includes a suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the library's functionality. These tests can help detect regressions and unexpected behavior that might have security implications. (Implemented: Project's Test Suite)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community for Security Vulnerability Reporting - The project depends on the community to report security vulnerabilities. There is a risk that vulnerabilities might not be reported promptly or at all.
- accepted risk: Limited Dedicated Security Expertise - The project maintainers are primarily focused on functionality and performance. Dedicated security expertise might be limited, potentially leading to oversight of subtle security issues.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `concurrent-ruby`.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses in the library's design and implementation.
- security control: Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear and public security vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers and users on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. `concurrent-ruby` is a library and does not handle user authentication directly. Applications using `concurrent-ruby` are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. `concurrent-ruby` does not enforce authorization. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that utilize this library.
- Input Validation: Input validation is crucial for the APIs exposed by `concurrent-ruby`. The library should validate all inputs to its public methods to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities arising from malformed input. This includes validating data types, ranges, and formats.
- Cryptography: While `concurrent-ruby` itself is not primarily focused on cryptography, it might be used in concurrent applications that handle sensitive data and require cryptographic operations. If `concurrent-ruby` provides any utilities or helpers related to cryptography, they must be implemented securely, following best practices and using well-vetted cryptographic libraries. If not, applications using `concurrent-ruby` will need to ensure they are using secure cryptographic practices independently.

    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Ruby developers contribute code changes to the `concurrent-ruby` project by pushing commits to the Git repository hosted on GitHub.
2. Git Repository (GitHub): The GitHub repository stores the source code, commit history, and pull requests for the `concurrent-ruby` project. It acts as the central version control system.
3. GitHub Actions (CI/CD): GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD platform to automate the build, test, and release process. Upon code changes (e.g., pull requests, merges to main branch), GitHub Actions workflows are triggered.
4. Build & Test Process: The CI/CD pipeline executes a series of steps, including:
    - Fetching the latest code from the repository.
    - Setting up the Ruby build environment.
    - Running linters and static analysis tools to check code quality and identify potential issues.
    - Executing unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
    - Building the RubyGem package artifact.
5. Gem Package Artifact: If the build and tests are successful, a RubyGem package (`.gem` file) is created. This artifact contains the compiled library and necessary metadata for distribution.
6. RubyGems Repository: The generated Gem Package Artifact is published to the RubyGems repository, making it available for Ruby developers to download and use in their applications.

Build Process Security Controls:
- security control: Secure Code Repository (GitHub) - GitHub provides security features like access controls, audit logs, and vulnerability scanning to protect the source code repository.
- security control: CI/CD Pipeline Security (GitHub Actions) - Secure configuration of GitHub Actions workflows, including secrets management, least privilege access for actions, and secure runner environments.
- security control: Automated Security Checks - Integration of SAST tools and linters in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Automated scanning of dependencies during the build process to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Test Automation - Comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Code Signing (potentially) - Consider signing the Gem package to ensure its integrity and authenticity, allowing users to verify that the package has not been tampered with.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Applications that rely on `concurrent-ruby` for core functionalities, especially those requiring high performance, responsiveness, or concurrent processing of critical tasks. Examples include:
    - High-traffic web applications and APIs.
    - Real-time data processing systems.
    - Background job processing frameworks.
    - Event-driven architectures.

Data Sensitivity:
- The `concurrent-ruby` library itself does not directly handle or store application data. However, it is used in applications that process and manage various types of data, which can include sensitive information such as:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    - Financial data.
    - Healthcare records.
    - Intellectual property.
    - Business-critical operational data.

The sensitivity of data depends on the specific applications using `concurrent-ruby`. A vulnerability in `concurrent-ruby` could potentially impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data processed by these applications. The impact would vary based on the nature of the vulnerability and how it is exploited within the context of a specific application.
