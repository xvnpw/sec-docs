# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Threat: [Race Condition Exploitation](./threats/race_condition_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit race conditions arising from concurrent access to shared mutable state managed by `concurrent-ruby` primitives (e.g., `Atomic`, `Mutex`). By carefully timing requests, they can manipulate data inconsistently, bypassing security checks or corrupting critical information.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, financial loss, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Atom`, `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`, `Concurrent::Hash`, `Concurrent::Array`, Futures, Promises, Actors.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize `concurrent-ruby` synchronization primitives correctly to protect shared mutable state.
* Favor immutable data structures to minimize the need for synchronization.
* Thoroughly test concurrent code for race conditions using appropriate tools and techniques.
* Conduct security code reviews focusing on concurrency and data sharing patterns.

## Threat: [Deadlock-Induced Denial of Service](./threats/deadlock-induced_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** Attackers trigger deadlocks by crafting requests that cause threads managed by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., in thread pools, actors) to block each other indefinitely while waiting for resources (locks, etc.). This leads to application unresponsiveness and denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`, Futures, Promises, Actors, Thread Pools.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for lock acquisition when using `concurrent-ruby` mutexes.
* Design concurrent workflows to minimize lock contention and complex locking patterns.
* Monitor application threads and resource usage to detect potential deadlocks.
* Consider actor-based concurrency to reduce reliance on explicit locks.

## Threat: [Thread Pool Exhaustion Attack](./threats/thread_pool_exhaustion_attack.md)

**Description:** Attackers flood the application with requests, overwhelming `concurrent-ruby` thread pools (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, `FixedThreadPool`, etc.). This exhausts available threads, preventing legitimate tasks from being processed and causing denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application unresponsiveness, performance degradation.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`, `Concurrent::FixedThreadPool`, `Concurrent::CachedThreadPool`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use bounded `concurrent-ruby` thread pools with appropriate maximum sizes.
* Implement request rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.
* Employ queue management and backpressure to handle request surges effectively.
* Monitor thread pool utilization and adjust pool sizes dynamically if needed.

## Threat: [Memory Leak Exploitation via Concurrent Objects](./threats/memory_leak_exploitation_via_concurrent_objects.md)

**Description:** Attackers trigger memory leaks by exploiting improper object lifecycle management in concurrent contexts created by `concurrent-ruby` (Futures, Promises, Actors). Unreleased references in closures or callbacks within concurrent tasks can lead to gradual memory exhaustion and application failure.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash due to out-of-memory errors), performance degradation.

**Affected Component:** Futures, Promises, Actors, Closures used within concurrent tasks.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully manage object lifecycles within `concurrent-ruby` concurrency constructs.
* Use weak references where appropriate to prevent unintended object retention in concurrent contexts.
* Implement proper resource cleanup within concurrent tasks and callbacks.
* Regularly monitor application memory usage and profile for leaks, especially in concurrent code paths.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exception Propagation leading to Inconsistent State](./threats/unhandled_exception_propagation_leading_to_inconsistent_state.md)

**Description:** Attackers trigger exceptions within concurrent tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby` (Futures, Actors, Thread Pools). If these exceptions are not properly handled using `concurrent-ruby`'s error handling mechanisms (e.g., `.rescue` on Futures), it can lead to inconsistent application state, data corruption, or silent failures.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, denial of service, logging failures, unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** Futures, Promises, Actors, Thread Pools, `Concurrent::Promise.rescue`, `Concurrent::Future.rescue`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust error handling within all concurrent tasks using `concurrent-ruby`'s error handling features.
* Utilize `.rescue` and `.then` with error callbacks for Futures and Promises to catch and handle exceptions.
* Implement centralized logging and monitoring for exceptions occurring in concurrent tasks.
* Design error handling strategies to maintain data consistency and application stability even during concurrent failures.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `concurrent-ruby` Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of__concurrent-ruby__library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities present in the `concurrent-ruby` library code itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or actions that trigger vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The entire `concurrent-ruby` library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `concurrent-ruby` library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `concurrent-ruby` and its dependencies.
* Implement a robust vulnerability management process for all third-party libraries, including `concurrent-ruby`.
* Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
