Here's the updated threat list, focusing on high and critical threats directly involving `concurrent-ruby`:

*   **Threat:** Deadlock Exploitation via `Concurrent::Mutex` and Other Synchronization Primitives
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft specific sequences of requests or interactions that exploit the locking mechanisms provided by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantMutex`, `Concurrent::ReadWriteLock`). By manipulating the order in which threads attempt to acquire these locks, the attacker can force the application into a deadlock state where multiple threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for resources held by each other.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs, inability to process requests, denial of service, requiring manual intervention to restart the application.
    *   **Which `concurrent-ruby` component is affected:** `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantMutex`, `Concurrent::ReadWriteLock`, `Concurrent::Condition`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Follow established best practices for deadlock prevention, such as consistent lock ordering, avoiding holding multiple locks simultaneously for extended periods, and using timeouts for lock acquisition. Implement monitoring to detect potential deadlocks. Review code for potential deadlock scenarios involving `concurrent-ruby`'s synchronization primitives.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` or Actor Creation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might send a large number of requests or trigger actions that cause the application to create an excessive number of threads via `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` without proper maximum pool size limits, or create an unbounded number of actors using `Concurrent::Actor::Context`. This can overwhelm system resources (CPU, memory) leading to a denial of service. The attacker directly leverages `concurrent-ruby`'s mechanisms for creating concurrent entities.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdowns, crashes, denial of service, potentially impacting other services on the same infrastructure.
    *   **Which `concurrent-ruby` component is affected:** `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`, `Concurrent::Actor::Context`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Configure `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` with appropriate `max_threads` and `max_queue` settings. Implement backpressure mechanisms to handle bursts of requests before they lead to excessive thread or actor creation. Limit the rate at which actors can be created. Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for excessive consumption related to `concurrent-ruby`'s thread pools and actors.
