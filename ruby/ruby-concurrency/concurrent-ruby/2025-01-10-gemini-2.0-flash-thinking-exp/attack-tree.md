## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Concurrent-Ruby Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_concurrent-ruby_library.md)

*   **Trigger Internal Race Conditions**
    *   **Overload Concurrent Collections (e.g., Concurrent::Map)** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Overload Concurrent Collections (e.g., Concurrent::Map):** Flooding concurrent collections with a high volume of simultaneous operations can expose subtle race conditions or performance bottlenecks that could be exploited to cause unexpected behavior or data corruption.
    *   **Exploit Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations**
        *   **Trigger Exceptions that Expose Sensitive Information due to Improper Handling** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Trigger Exceptions that Expose Sensitive Information due to Improper Handling:** If exceptions within `concurrent-ruby`'s internal operations are not properly handled and propagate outwards, they might reveal sensitive information about the application's state or environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misuse of Concurrent-Ruby in Application Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misuse_of_concurrent-ruby_in_application_code.md)

*   **Exploit Race Conditions in Application Logic** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Identify Critical Sections Not Properly Protected by Synchronization Primitives** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Manipulate Shared State Accessed by Concurrent Tasks** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Exploit Race Conditions in Application Logic:** Even with the thread-safe primitives provided by `concurrent-ruby`, developers can still introduce race conditions in their application logic if they don't properly synchronize access to shared mutable state.
            *   **Identify Critical Sections Not Properly Protected by Synchronization Primitives:** Attackers analyze the application code to find critical sections where shared resources are accessed without adequate locking or other synchronization mechanisms.
            *   **Manipulate Shared State Accessed by Concurrent Tasks:** By carefully timing requests or actions, attackers can exploit race conditions to manipulate shared variables or data structures in unintended ways, leading to incorrect application behavior or data corruption.
    *   **Exploit Improper Error Handling of Concurrent Operations** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Exploit Improper Error Handling of Concurrent Operations:** Developers might not handle errors arising from concurrent operations correctly, leading to unexpected application states or crashes.
    *   **Abuse Actor System Misconfiguration or Weaknesses** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Overload Actors with Excessive Messages (DoS)** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Abuse Actor System Misconfiguration or Weaknesses:** If the application utilizes `concurrent-ruby`'s actor model, there are potential vulnerabilities related to actor communication and management.
            *   **Overload Actors with Excessive Messages (DoS):** Flooding an actor with a large number of messages can overwhelm its processing capacity, leading to denial of service for that specific actor or even the entire application.
    *   **Exploit Improper Use of Concurrent Data Structures** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Cause Data Corruption by Exploiting Lack of Atomicity in Operations** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Exploit Improper Use of Concurrent Data Structures:** Even when using concurrent data structures, improper usage can lead to vulnerabilities.
            *   **Cause Data Corruption by Exploiting Lack of Atomicity in Operations:** While concurrent data structures provide atomic operations for individual actions, sequences of operations might not be atomic. Attackers can exploit this to cause data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction with Underlying System Amplified by Concurrent-Ruby](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_with_underlying_system_amplified_by_concurrent-ruby.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Spawn Excessive Concurrent Tasks to Consume System Resources (CPU, Memory)** **(Critical Node)**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**
            *   **Spawn Excessive Concurrent Tasks to Consume System Resources (CPU, Memory):** Attackers can exploit the application's concurrency mechanisms to spawn a large number of threads or tasks, overwhelming system resources and leading to denial of service.
