# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Resource Consumption (Threads/Actors)](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_resource_consumption__threadsactors_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting system resources (CPU, memory) by triggering the creation of an excessive number of threads or actors.
    *   **How Concurrent-Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides mechanisms like `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `Actor` which, if not configured with proper limits, can be exploited to spawn numerous concurrent entities.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user sends a flood of requests to an application that uses `concurrent-ruby`'s `ThreadPoolExecutor` without a `max_threads` limit. Each request triggers a new thread creation, eventually overwhelming the system.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing the server or impacting other services on the same machine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement maximum pool sizes for `ThreadPoolExecutor` and other thread pool implementations.
        *   Set limits on the number of actors that can be created or active concurrently.
        *   Implement request rate limiting or queuing mechanisms to prevent overwhelming the thread/actor creation process.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, thread count) and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_and_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:**  Unintended and potentially harmful outcomes occur when multiple threads or actors access and modify shared mutable state concurrently without proper synchronization.
    *   **How Concurrent-Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` facilitates concurrent access to shared data through features like shared variables accessed by threads in a pool or messages exchanged between actors. Lack of proper synchronization using tools provided by the library or language features can lead to race conditions.
    *   **Example:** Two threads in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` increment a shared counter variable without using a mutex or atomic operation. The final value of the counter might be incorrect due to interleaved operations.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential security vulnerabilities if the corrupted data affects access control or business logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize appropriate synchronization primitives provided by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., `Mutex`, `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, `AtomicReference`) when accessing and modifying shared mutable state.
        *   Favor immutable data structures where possible to avoid shared mutable state.
        *   Carefully design concurrent algorithms to minimize the need for shared mutable state.
        *   Employ testing strategies specifically designed to detect race conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Task Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_task_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the code executed concurrently within `concurrent-ruby`'s constructs (e.g., `Future` callbacks, actor message handlers) can be exploited.
    *   **How Concurrent-Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides the framework for executing user-defined code concurrently. If this code contains vulnerabilities, the concurrency can amplify the impact or introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An actor's message handler directly executes shell commands based on unsanitized data received in a message, leading to command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the custom code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply standard secure coding practices to all code executed concurrently.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external input processed within concurrent tasks.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for concurrent tasks.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code within concurrent tasks for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Task Queue Saturation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_task_queue_saturation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can overwhelm the application by flooding task queues used by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., actor mailboxes, `ThreadPoolExecutor` task queues) with malicious or excessive tasks.
    *   **How Concurrent-Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` relies on queues for managing asynchronous tasks and messages. If these queues lack size limits or proper backpressure mechanisms, they can be targeted for DoS attacks.
    *   **Example:** Sending a massive number of messages to an actor's mailbox, causing it to consume excessive memory and processing time, preventing it from handling legitimate messages.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially leading to a complete denial of service.
