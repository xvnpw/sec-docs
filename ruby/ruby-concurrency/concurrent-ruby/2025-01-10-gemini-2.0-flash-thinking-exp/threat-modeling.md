# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Threat: [Data Races Leading to Inconsistent State](./threats/data_races_leading_to_inconsistent_state.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could exploit race conditions arising from concurrent access and modification of shared mutable data without proper synchronization *using `concurrent-ruby` primitives incorrectly or insufficiently*. This could involve sending simultaneous requests or triggering concurrent operations designed to manipulate shared data at the same time, bypassing intended atomic operations or critical sections.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation if data related to authorization or access control is affected, and unexpected application behavior leading to denial of service or further exploitation.
- **Affected Component:** Code sections that access and modify shared mutable state relying on, but misusing or inadequately applying, `concurrent-ruby`'s synchronization primitives (e.g., `Concurrent::Atom`, `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`). This includes incorrect usage of atomic operations or missing synchronization around regular Ruby objects in concurrent contexts managed by `concurrent-ruby`.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Rigorously utilize `concurrent-ruby`'s atomic data structures (`Concurrent::Atom`, `Concurrent::AtomicBoolean`, `Concurrent::AtomicFixnum`) for managing simple shared state, ensuring correct usage of their atomic operations (e.g., `compare_and_set`, `update`).
    - Employ explicit locking mechanisms like `Concurrent::Mutex` or `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock` to protect critical sections of code that access shared mutable data. Ensure proper lock acquisition and release, and avoid common locking pitfalls.
    - Favor immutable data structures and functional programming paradigms where possible to minimize the need for shared mutable state and complex synchronization when using `concurrent-ruby`.
    - Implement thorough testing specifically targeting concurrent code paths to identify and eliminate potential race conditions arising from the use of `concurrent-ruby`.

## Threat: [Deadlocks Causing Denial of Service](./threats/deadlocks_causing_denial_of_service.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a deadlock scenario where two or more threads or fibers managed by `concurrent-ruby` become blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release `concurrent-ruby` managed resources (e.g., locks). This might involve crafting specific sequences of requests or actions that lead to circular dependencies in lock acquisition using `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`, or `Concurrent::Semaphore`.
- **Impact:** Application hangs, unresponsiveness, and denial of service, potentially requiring manual intervention to recover.
- **Affected Component:** Code sections utilizing multiple `concurrent-ruby` synchronization primitives (`Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`, `Concurrent::Semaphore`) where the order of acquisition can lead to circular dependencies within `concurrent-ruby` managed concurrency.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Establish a consistent order for acquiring `concurrent-ruby` locks across the application to prevent circular dependencies.
    - Implement timeouts when attempting to acquire `concurrent-ruby` locks to prevent indefinite blocking.
    - Consider using higher-level concurrency abstractions within `concurrent-ruby` like actors or message passing to reduce the need for explicit lock management.
    - Employ deadlock detection tools or techniques during development and testing, specifically focusing on interactions involving `concurrent-ruby`'s synchronization mechanisms.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Concurrency](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_concurrency.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could flood the application with requests or actions that create a large number of concurrent tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., using `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` or creating many actors) without proper limits, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) within the `concurrent-ruby` execution environment.
- **Impact:** Performance degradation, application crashes due to out-of-memory errors or thread exhaustion within `concurrent-ruby`'s thread pools, and denial of service.
- **Affected Component:** `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`, `Concurrent::CachedThreadPool`, `Concurrent::TimerTask`, and actor systems within `concurrent-ruby` where the creation of concurrent entities is not properly bounded. Unbounded queues within executors are also a key factor.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use bounded thread pools (`Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`) with appropriately configured maximum pool sizes and queue lengths.
    - Implement mechanisms to limit the rate of incoming requests or the creation of concurrent tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby`.
    - Monitor resource usage of `concurrent-ruby` components and implement circuit breakers or throttling mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion.
    - Be cautious with unbounded queues in `concurrent-ruby` executors, as they can lead to memory exhaustion. Configure appropriate queue sizes or use alternative queuing strategies.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unhandled Exceptions in Futures/Promises](./threats/exploiting_unhandled_exceptions_in_futurespromises.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could trigger operations within `Concurrent::Future` or `Concurrent::Promise` computations that result in unhandled exceptions. If these exceptions are not properly propagated or handled within the `concurrent-ruby` framework, it could lead to unexpected application behavior or the termination of critical concurrent tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby`.
- **Impact:** Loss of functionality within concurrent workflows, inconsistent state if dependent operations managed by `concurrent-ruby` are not completed, and potential for further exploitation if the application's error handling for `concurrent-ruby` constructs is weak.
- **Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Future`, `Concurrent::Promise`, and code blocks executed within these constructs where exceptions are not caught and handled appropriately *within the `concurrent-ruby` context*.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always handle exceptions within `Concurrent::Future` and `Concurrent::Promise` computations using `rescue` blocks or the `rescue` method provided by `concurrent-ruby`.
    - Utilize the `on_error` callback for futures and promises to handle exceptions asynchronously within the `concurrent-ruby` framework.
    - Implement robust error logging and monitoring for exceptions occurring in `concurrent-ruby` managed concurrent contexts.

## Threat: [Actor Message Poisoning (If Using Actors)](./threats/actor_message_poisoning__if_using_actors_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could send malicious or unexpected messages to `Concurrent::Actor` instances, potentially causing them to enter an invalid state, perform unintended actions, or consume excessive resources within the actor system. This could involve crafting messages with unexpected data types, sizes, or commands targeted at exploiting vulnerabilities in actor message processing logic.
- **Impact:** Actor failure, data corruption within the actor's state, denial of service if the actor is critical to application functionality, or triggering unintended side effects due to malicious message processing.
- **Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Actor::Context`, actor mailboxes, and the message processing logic within actor definitions in `concurrent-ruby`.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for messages received by `Concurrent::Actor` instances.
    - Define clear message protocols and enforce them within actor logic to prevent processing of unexpected message types or structures.
    - Consider using typed actors or message schemas to enforce message structure within the `concurrent-ruby` actor system.
    - Implement robust error handling within actor message processing to gracefully handle unexpected or malicious messages.
