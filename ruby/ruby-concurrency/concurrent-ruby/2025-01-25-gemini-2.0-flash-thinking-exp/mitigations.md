# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Atomic Operations](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_atomic_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify shared variables modified by concurrent tasks.
    *   Step 2: Replace direct operations with atomic operations from `concurrent-ruby`.
    *   Step 3: Wrap shared variables using `Concurrent::AtomicBoolean`, `Concurrent::AtomicFixnum`, `Concurrent::AtomicReference`.
    *   Step 4: Use atomic methods like `#increment`, `#compare_and_set` for modifications.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Race Conditions - Severity: High
    *   Data Corruption - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Race Conditions: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Corruption: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially in areas handling shared counters or flags.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Mutexes and Locks](./mitigation_strategies/employ_mutexes_and_locks.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify critical sections accessing shared resources.
    *   Step 2: Instantiate `Concurrent::Mutex` or `Concurrent::ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
    *   Step 3: Acquire lock using `#lock` (or `#acquire_read_lock`, `#acquire_write_lock`) before critical section.
    *   Step 4: Release lock using `#unlock` (or `#release_read_lock`, `#release_write_lock`) after critical section, using `ensure` blocks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Race Conditions - Severity: High
    *   Data Corruption - Severity: High
    *   Deadlocks - Severity: Medium (if not used carefully)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Race Conditions: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Corruption: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Deadlocks: Partially reduces risk (correct usage dependent).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially in areas with unsynchronized shared resource access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Thread-Safe Data Structures](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_thread-safe_data_structures.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify standard Ruby data structures shared and modified concurrently.
    *   Step 2: Replace them with `concurrent-ruby`'s thread-safe counterparts: `Concurrent::Array`, `Concurrent::Hash`, `Concurrent::Set`, `Concurrent::Map`.
    *   Step 3: Use methods provided by `Concurrent::` classes for all operations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Race Conditions - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Corruption - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Race Conditions: Partially reduces risk.
    *   Data Corruption: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially in shared data caches or task lists.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Timeouts for Lock Acquisition (Deadlock Prevention/Recovery)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_timeouts_for_lock_acquisition__deadlock_preventionrecovery_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Use `:timeout` option with `Concurrent::Mutex#lock` or similar methods.
    *   Step 2: Set a reasonable timeout value.
    *   Step 3: Check return value of `#lock(timeout: ...)`.
    *   Step 4: Implement backoff strategy on timeout.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deadlocks - Severity: Medium (Recovery)
    *   Resource Starvation - Severity: Low (Indirectly)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deadlocks: Partially reduces risk (recovery mechanism).
    *   Resource Starvation: Minimally reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially in lock acquisition points where contention is expected.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Thread Pools and Fiber Pools (Resource Exhaustion Prevention)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_thread_pools_and_fiber_pools__resource_exhaustion_prevention_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Use `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` or `Concurrent::FiberPool` instead of direct thread/fiber creation.
    *   Step 2: Configure pool size based on workload and resources.
    *   Step 3: Submit tasks to pool using `#post`, `#schedule`.
    *   Step 4: Monitor pool metrics and adjust configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Thread/Fiber Explosion) - Severity: High
    *   Performance Degradation (Context Switching Overhead) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Performance Degradation: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially if application directly spawns threads/fibers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Exceptions within Concurrent Tasks (Error Handling & Stability)](./mitigation_strategies/handle_exceptions_within_concurrent_tasks__error_handling_&_stability_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Wrap code in concurrent tasks (e.g., `Concurrent::Future.execute`, thread/fiber blocks) with `begin...rescue...end`.
    *   Step 2: Catch exceptions within `rescue` block.
    *   Step 3: Implement error handling logic (logging, retry, graceful failure).
    *   Step 4: For `Concurrent::Future`, use `#rescue` or `#then` for exception management.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Application Instability - Severity: Medium
    *   Unpredictable Behavior - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Leaks (in some error scenarios) - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application Instability: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Unpredictable Behavior: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Resource Leaks: Minimally reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially in some concurrent task implementations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `concurrent-ruby` Updated (Vulnerability Management)](./mitigation_strategies/keep__concurrent-ruby__updated__vulnerability_management_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly check for `concurrent-ruby` updates.
    *   Step 2: Use dependency management tools to update to latest stable version.
    *   Step 3: Include updates in maintenance process.
    *   Step 4: Test application after updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Vulnerabilities in `concurrent-ruby` - Severity: Varies
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Hypothetical Project).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially if dependency updates are not regular.
