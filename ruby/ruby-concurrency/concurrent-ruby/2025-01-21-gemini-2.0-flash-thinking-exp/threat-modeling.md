# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby

## Threat: [Unhandled Promise Rejection/Exception Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unhandled_promise_rejectionexception_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger actions that lead to unhandled promise rejections or exceptions within asynchronous tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby`. This could involve providing unexpected input or exploiting edge cases in the application logic executed within a promise. If these rejections are not caught and handled, they can lead to the accumulation of uncompleted tasks, potentially exhausting thread pool resources managed by `concurrent-ruby` or other system resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting available threads or memory, application instability.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Promise`, `Concurrent::Future`, `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always attach `.rescue` blocks to promises to handle potential rejections and prevent them from propagating unhandled.
* Implement global error handling mechanisms for asynchronous operations managed by `concurrent-ruby`.
* Set timeouts for promises to prevent indefinite waiting.
* Monitor thread pool usage and resource consumption to detect potential exhaustion.

## Threat: [Long-Running or Infinite Promise/Future Blocking Resources](./threats/long-running_or_infinite_promisefuture_blocking_resources.md)

**Description:** An attacker could initiate actions that result in promises or futures managed by `concurrent-ruby` that never resolve or take an excessively long time to complete. This could be achieved by exploiting dependencies on external services that become unavailable or by providing input that leads to computationally intensive or infinite loops within the asynchronous task managed by `concurrent-ruby`. This can tie up threads in the `concurrent-ruby` thread pool, preventing other tasks from being executed.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking threads, performance degradation for other application functionalities.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Promise`, `Concurrent::Future`, `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for promises and futures managed by `concurrent-ruby`.
* Design asynchronous tasks to be resilient to external failures and handle timeouts gracefully.
* Monitor the execution time of asynchronous tasks managed by `concurrent-ruby` and identify potential long-running operations.
* Use circuit breaker patterns to prevent repeated calls to failing dependencies.

## Threat: [Thread Pool Exhaustion via Malicious Task Submission](./threats/thread_pool_exhaustion_via_malicious_task_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker could submit a large number of computationally expensive or long-running tasks to a `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`. If the thread pool's maximum size is not appropriately configured or if there are no mechanisms to limit task submissions, the attacker could exhaust the available threads managed by `concurrent-ruby`, preventing legitimate tasks from being executed.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure the maximum size of `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` based on the application's expected workload and available resources.
* Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for task submissions, especially from external sources.
* Monitor thread pool utilization and queue length to detect potential exhaustion.

## Threat: [Execution of Untrusted Code within a Task](./threats/execution_of_untrusted_code_within_a_task.md)

**Description:** If the application allows external input to directly influence the code executed within a task submitted to a `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` (e.g., through dynamic code evaluation or deserialization of untrusted data), an attacker could inject and execute malicious code on the server. This directly leverages the task execution capabilities of `concurrent-ruby`.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` (if tasks are created based on untrusted input).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never directly execute code derived from untrusted input within tasks submitted to `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor`.
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources without strict validation and sanitization.
* Use sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potentially malicious code execution within `concurrent-ruby` tasks.

## Threat: [Deadlocks Due to Improper Synchronization Primitives](./threats/deadlocks_due_to_improper_synchronization_primitives.md)

**Description:** An attacker might trigger a sequence of events that leads to a deadlock situation involving `concurrent-ruby`'s synchronization primitives like `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReadWriteLock`, or `Concurrent::Semaphore`. This could involve manipulating the order in which threads acquire these locks or semaphores, causing them to block indefinitely while waiting for each other.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application hang.

**Affected Component:** `Concurrent::Mutex`, `Concurrent::ReadWriteLock`, `Concurrent::Semaphore`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Establish and enforce a consistent order for acquiring locks provided by `concurrent-ruby` to prevent circular dependencies.
* Use timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite blocking.
* Consider using higher-level concurrency abstractions within `concurrent-ruby` that reduce the need for manual lock management.
* Thoroughly analyze and test concurrent code for potential deadlock scenarios involving `concurrent-ruby`'s synchronization primitives.
