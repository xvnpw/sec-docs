## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Race Conditions **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_race_conditions_high_risk_path.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploiting subtle timing differences in concurrent operations to manipulate shared state in unintended ways.
*   Critical Node: Timing manipulation leads to unexpected state changes or data corruption due to non-atomic updates.
    *   Description: Attackers precisely time concurrent operations resolving the same promise to cause non-atomic updates to shared data, leading to corruption or inconsistencies.
*   Critical Node: Lack of proper synchronization within the Agent's update block leads to inconsistent state.
    *   Description: Attackers trigger concurrent updates to an Agent's state, and the absence of mutexes or other synchronization primitives results in a corrupted Agent state.
*   Attack Vector: Incorrectly using thread-safe concurrent data structures.
*   Critical Node: Incorrect usage or lack of thread-safety in application logic leads to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
    *   Description: Despite using `Concurrent::Map` or similar, application logic makes unsafe assumptions about operation order or atomicity, leading to data corruption when accessed concurrently.
*   Attack Vector: Relying on specific execution order within Executors.
*   Critical Node: Timing dependencies in task execution lead to unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities.
    *   Description: Attackers exploit dependencies on the order in which tasks are executed within a thread pool, leading to logic errors or security breaches if the order is manipulated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_resource_exhaustiondenial_of_service_high_risk_path.md)

*   Attack Vector: Flooding the application with resource-intensive tasks.
*   Critical Node: The Executor's thread pool becomes saturated, preventing legitimate tasks from being processed.
    *   Description: Attackers submit a large volume of CPU-intensive or long-running tasks, filling the thread pool and preventing normal application functionality.
*   Attack Vector: Exploiting unbounded task queues.
*   Critical Node: The queue grows indefinitely, consuming excessive memory and potentially leading to application crash.
    *   Description: Attackers submit a massive number of tasks to an Executor with an unbounded queue, leading to memory exhaustion and application failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deadlocks or Livelocks **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deadlocks_or_livelocks_high_risk_path.md)

*   Attack Vector: Creating circular dependencies between asynchronous operations.
*   Critical Node: The application becomes unresponsive as threads are blocked indefinitely (Circular Dependencies in Futures).
    *   Description: Attackers trigger a scenario where multiple futures are waiting for each other to complete, creating a deadlock and making the application hang.
*   Attack Vector: Triggering inconsistent lock acquisition order.
*   Critical Node: The application becomes unresponsive (Improper Lock Usage).
    *   Description: Attackers cause threads to acquire locks in different sequences, leading to a classic deadlock scenario where threads are blocked waiting for each other.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Usage of Atomics **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_usage_of_atomics_high_risk_path.md)

*   Attack Vector: Circumventing atomic operations with non-atomic access.
*   Critical Node: This can lead to race conditions and data corruption, even with the presence of atomic variables.
    *   Description: Attackers identify code paths where shared variables intended for atomic access are also accessed without atomic operations, leading to race conditions despite the use of atomics elsewhere.
*   Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in the logic of atomic operations.
*   Critical Node: This can lead to unexpected state changes or security vulnerabilities.
    *   Description: Attackers find and exploit errors in the implementation of atomic operations (e.g., incorrect compare-and-swap logic), leading to unintended state changes or security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Concurrent-Ruby Itself (Less Likely, but Possible) **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_concurrent-ruby_itself__less_likely__but_possible__high_risk_path.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploiting known security flaws in the library.
*   Critical Node: This could lead to various forms of compromise depending on the vulnerability (Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities).
    *   Description: Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of `concurrent-ruby` being used, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution or other significant compromises.
*   Attack Vector: Exploiting undiscovered security flaws in the library.
*   Critical Node: This could lead to significant compromise if the vulnerability is severe (Discover and Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities).
    *   Description: Highly skilled attackers discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities within the `concurrent-ruby` library, potentially leading to critical application compromise.
