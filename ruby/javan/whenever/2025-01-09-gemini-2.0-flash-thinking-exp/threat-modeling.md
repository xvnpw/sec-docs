# Threat Model Analysis for javan/whenever

## Threat: [Code Injection through `schedule.rb` Modification](./threats/code_injection_through__schedule_rb__modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `schedule.rb` file. They can then inject arbitrary Ruby code or shell commands directly into the file. When `whenever` parses this file to update the cron table, the malicious code will be executed as part of a scheduled job. This directly leverages `whenever`'s functionality of reading and interpreting `schedule.rb`.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server with the privileges of the user running the cron service. This could lead to data breaches, system disruption, or further attacks on internal networks.

**Affected Component:** `schedule.rb` file parsing and cron entry generation logic within `whenever`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`) for the `schedule.rb` file, restricting read and write access to the application owner.
* Employ code review processes for any changes to the `schedule.rb` file.
* Utilize version control for the `schedule.rb` file to track and revert unauthorized modifications.
* Secure the deployment process to prevent unauthorized modification of files during deployment.

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input in Cron Job Commands](./threats/unsanitized_input_in_cron_job_commands.md)

**Description:** The `schedule.rb` file dynamically constructs commands based on external input or application data without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate this input (e.g., through a vulnerability in another part of the application) to inject malicious commands into the scheduled cron jobs. When `whenever` generates the cron entry and the cron job executes, the injected commands will run on the server. This threat directly stems from how `whenever` processes the command definitions in `schedule.rb`.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server with the privileges of the user running the cron job. This could lead to data breaches, system manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The `schedule.rb` file, specifically the sections where commands are defined and potentially constructed dynamically. Also affects the cron entry generation logic within `whenever` that processes this file.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic command construction in `schedule.rb` whenever possible.
* If dynamic command construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize all external input used in command arguments using appropriate escaping or parameterization techniques.
* Implement input validation to ensure that only expected data is used in command construction.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Cron Job Execution (Directly related to `whenever`'s configuration)](./threats/overly_permissive_cron_job_execution__directly_related_to__whenever_'s_configuration_.md)

**Description:** While the OS ultimately executes the cron job, `whenever` facilitates the *configuration* of these jobs. If developers using `whenever` configure jobs to run with unnecessarily high privileges within the `schedule.rb` (even if indirectly through script execution), this becomes a threat directly related to how `whenever` is used. A compromised cron job configured via `whenever` with high privileges allows for greater impact.

**Impact:** If a scheduled task configured through `whenever` is compromised, the attacker gains the full privileges of the user running the cron job, potentially leading to complete system takeover if running as `root`.

**Affected Component:** The cron entry generation logic within `whenever` and the resulting cron entries. The configuration within `schedule.rb` is the direct input to this.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining cron jobs in `schedule.rb`. Ensure jobs run with the minimum necessary permissions.
* Create dedicated user accounts with restricted privileges for running specific cron tasks and configure `whenever` to use these accounts if necessary (though `whenever` doesn't directly manage user switching, it influences the command executed).
* Avoid running cron jobs as the `root` user unless absolutely necessary, and carefully review any such configurations in `schedule.rb`.
