## Attack Tree Path: [[ATTACKER GOAL: Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server via Whenever] (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_attacker_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server_via_whenever___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate objective. Success here means the attacker has managed to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to potential data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Gain Ability to Define/Modify Scheduled Tasks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_and__gain_ability_to_definemodify_scheduled_tasks__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This represents the crucial step where the attacker gains control over the scheduled tasks managed by Whenever. This can be achieved by either directly altering the configuration or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Whenever interprets task definitions. Once this ability is gained, the attacker can introduce malicious tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Directly Modify the schedule.rb File (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_or__directly_modify_the_schedule_rb_file__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  This path involves directly altering the `schedule.rb` file, which Whenever reads to define scheduled tasks. Attackers can achieve this by:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application:**  A vulnerability like a file upload issue or an insecure file write function in another part of the application could be leveraged to write to the `schedule.rb` file.
    * **Compromising the deployment process:** Insecure deployment scripts or lack of proper access controls during deployment could allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the `schedule.rb` file.
    * **Gaining unauthorized access to the server:** If the attacker manages to compromise the server through methods like SSH brute-forcing or exploiting server vulnerabilities, they can directly edit the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Gain File System Write Access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_and__gain_file_system_write_access__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is a prerequisite for directly modifying the `schedule.rb` file. Attackers need the ability to write to the file system where `schedule.rb` is located. This can be achieved through:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in another part of the application allowing file write.**
    * **Compromising the deployment process.**
    * **Gaining unauthorized access to the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Whenever's Task Definition Syntax/Parsing (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_or__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_whenever's_task_definition_syntaxparsing__high_risk_path__critical_n_c01885c4.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on weaknesses within the `whenever` gem itself in how it interprets the `schedule.rb` file. If Whenever doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input, attackers can craft malicious entries that lead to unintended code execution. This bypasses the need for direct file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Inject Malicious Code within a `command` Definition (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_and__inject_malicious_code_within_a__command__definition__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is a specific type of vulnerability within Whenever's task definition parsing. If the `command` argument within a scheduled task is not properly sanitized before being passed to the system shell, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands. For example, instead of a legitimate command, they could inject something like `"rm -rf /"` or a command to download and execute a malicious script. This is a classic command injection vulnerability.
