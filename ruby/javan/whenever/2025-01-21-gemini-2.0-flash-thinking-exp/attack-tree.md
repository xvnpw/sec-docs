# Attack Tree Analysis for javan/whenever

Objective: Compromise application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `whenever` gem.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application via Whenever
    *   Exploit Malicious Schedule Definition **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Gain Access to Modify schedule.rb **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Inject Malicious Code into schedule.rb **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Execute Arbitrary System Commands **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Modify Application Data/State **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Exfiltrate Sensitive Information **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Schedule Definition [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_schedule_definition__critical_node_.md)

This represents the overarching attack vector where the attacker aims to compromise the application by manipulating the `schedule.rb` file. Success here directly leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Modify schedule.rb [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_modify_schedule_rb__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical prerequisite for injecting malicious code. Attackers might achieve this through:
        *   Compromised Developer Machine: Accessing the codebase through a compromised developer's system.
        *   Vulnerabilities in Version Control System: Exploiting weaknesses in the VCS to modify the file.
        *   Compromised Deployment Process: Injecting malicious code during an insecure deployment.
        *   Insufficient File Permissions: Directly modifying the file on the server due to overly permissive permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into schedule.rb [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_schedule_rb__critical_node_.md)

Once access is gained, attackers can inject arbitrary Ruby code into the `schedule.rb` file. This is a critical node because it opens the door to various high-impact malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary System Commands [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_system_commands__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Malicious code injected into `schedule.rb` can utilize Ruby's system execution methods (e.g., `system()`, backticks) to run arbitrary commands on the server. This is a high-risk path due to the ease of execution and the potential for complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Data/State [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_datastate__high_risk_path_.md)

Injected malicious code can interact with the application's resources, such as databases or file systems, to alter data, modify application behavior, or create backdoors. This is a high-risk path due to the potential for data corruption and manipulation of the application's intended functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Information [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_information__high_risk_path_.md)

Malicious code can access sensitive data stored within the application or on the server and transmit it to an attacker-controlled location. This is a high-risk path due to the potential for significant data breaches and privacy violations.
