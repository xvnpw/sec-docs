# Threat Model Analysis for javan/whenever

## Threat: [Malicious Cron Job Injection via Indirect Configuration Manipulation](./threats/malicious_cron_job_injection_via_indirect_configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code or configuration that allow them to indirectly influence the content of `schedule.rb` or the arguments passed to `whenever` during crontab updates. This could involve manipulating database records, environment variables, or other configuration sources used by the application to generate the cron schedule, which `whenever` then processes.

**Impact:** Similar to direct `schedule.rb` manipulation, leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `Whenever::JobList` (processes the configuration), `Whenever::Writer::Crontab` (writes the potentially malicious entries to the crontab).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data that influences the `whenever` configuration.
* Secure all configuration sources used by the application.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to modify configuration data.
* Regularly audit the application's code and configuration for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `whenever` Gem Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__whenever__gem_itself.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the `whenever` gem's code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability during the process of generating or updating the crontab. This could involve providing specially crafted input to `whenever` that leads to arbitrary code execution on the server when `whenever` attempts to process it.

**Impact:** Potentially similar impacts to malicious cron job injection, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could lead to system compromise if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution during crontab updates.

**Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the `whenever` gem responsible for parsing the schedule and writing to the crontab.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `whenever` gem updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to the `whenever` gem.
* Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies, including `whenever`.
