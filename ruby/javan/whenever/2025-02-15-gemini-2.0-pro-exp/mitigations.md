# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for javan/whenever

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dedicated User with Least Privilege (via `whenever`)](./mitigation_strategies/dedicated_user_with_least_privilege__via__whenever__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create User:** (As described previously - this step is *external* to `whenever`, but necessary for the next step). Create a low-privilege system user.
2.  **`whenever` Configuration:**  In your `schedule.rb` file, *use the `:user` option* to specify the dedicated user: `set :user, 'my_app_scheduler'`. This is the *direct `whenever` interaction*.
3.  **Deploy and Verify:** Deploy. Verify cron jobs run as the correct user: `crontab -l -u my_app_scheduler`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the damage if a scheduled task is compromised.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Restricts access to only what the dedicated user can access.
*   **System Compromise (Severity: High):** Limits the attacker's ability to modify the system.

**Impact:**
*   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced by limiting the privileges of the user running the cron jobs.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify where the `:user` option is used in `schedule.rb` (e.g., "`schedule.rb` uses `:user => 'scheduler_user'`").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify where the `:user` option is *not* used or needs to be updated (e.g., "Legacy tasks in `old_schedule.rb` do not specify a user.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration and Environment Variables (Minimize `env` in `whenever`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_and_environment_variables__minimize__env__in__whenever__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Secure Storage:** (As described previously - external to `whenever`, but crucial). Store sensitive data securely (secrets manager, encrypted credentials, etc.).
2.  **Minimize `env`:** *Avoid using the `env` option in `whenever` to pass sensitive data*. This is the key `whenever`-specific mitigation. If you *absolutely must* use environment variables, ensure they are set securely on the server and *not* exposed in the generated crontab. Prefer loading secrets *within* the executed script.
3.  **Review `schedule.rb`:** Examine your `schedule.rb` file and remove or replace any instances of `env` that expose sensitive information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of secrets being exposed in the crontab or process list.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for attackers to obtain credentials.

**Impact:**
*   Credential Exposure: Risk significantly reduced by avoiding direct exposure of secrets in the cron configuration.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify how `env` is used (or not used) in `schedule.rb` (e.g., "No use of `env` in `schedule.rb`. All secrets loaded within scripts.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify any instances where `env` is used insecurely (e.g., "`schedule.rb` uses `env` to pass a database password. Needs refactoring.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Command Injection Prevention (Prefer `runner` and `rake` over `command`)](./mitigation_strategies/command_injection_prevention__prefer__runner__and__rake__over__command__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Prioritize `runner` and `rake`:**  In your `schedule.rb` file, *use the `runner` and `rake` methods whenever possible instead of `command`*. This is the core `whenever`-specific mitigation.
2.  **`command` Justification:** If you *must* use `command`, document *why* `runner` or `rake` are not suitable. This forces a conscious decision and helps with future reviews.
3.  **Safe `command` Usage:** If using `command`, *never* interpolate untrusted data directly. Use parameterized commands or shell escaping (e.g., `Shellwords.escape`).  This is *less* directly related to `whenever` itself, but is critical when using `whenever`'s `command` feature.
4. **Review:** Carefully review all uses of the command method.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact:**
*   Command Injection: Risk significantly reduced by favoring safer methods and using secure practices when `command` is unavoidable.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify the usage of `runner`, `rake`, and `command` in `schedule.rb` (e.g., "All tasks use `runner` or `rake`. No instances of `command`.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify any instances where `command` is used and needs refactoring (e.g., "Task `X` in `schedule.rb` uses `command` and needs to be rewritten using `runner`.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging and Auditing (via `whenever`'s `:output`)](./mitigation_strategies/logging_and_auditing__via__whenever_'s__output__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`whenever` Configuration:** In your `schedule.rb` file, *use the `:output` option* to redirect both standard output and standard error to a log file: `set :output, '/path/to/my_app/log/cron.log'`.  This is the direct `whenever` interaction.
2.  **Log Rotation:** (External to `whenever`, but important). Configure log rotation.
3.  **Log Review:** (External to `whenever`). Regularly review logs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Intrusion Detection (Severity: Medium):** Logs can provide evidence of attacks.
*   **Debugging (Severity: Low):** Helps diagnose problems.
*   **Auditing (Severity: Low):** Provides a record of actions.

**Impact:**
*   All listed threats: Improved detection, debugging, and auditing capabilities.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify the use of `:output` in `schedule.rb` (e.g., "`schedule.rb` uses `:output => '/var/log/my_app/cron.log'`").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify if `:output` is not used or needs configuration (e.g., "No `:output` redirection configured. Cron output is being lost.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Dependency Management (Updating the `whenever` gem)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_dependency_management__updating_the__whenever__gem_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Bundler:** Use Bundler.
2.  **Update Command:** Regularly run `bundle update whenever` to update the `whenever` gem itself. This is the direct action related to `whenever`.
3.  **Changelog Review:** Check the `whenever` changelog before updating.
4.  **Testing:** Test after updating.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in `whenever` (Severity: Variable):** Addresses potential security issues within the gem itself.

**Impact:**
*   Vulnerabilities in `whenever`: Reduces the risk of exploitation due to known gem vulnerabilities.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify the update frequency (e.g., "`bundle update whenever` is run monthly.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify if updates are not performed regularly (e.g., "No regular update schedule for `whenever`.").
