## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in `schedule.rb` Processing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in__schedule_rb__processing__critical_node_.md)

Critical Node Rationale:  Successful exploitation at this level allows the attacker to control the scheduled tasks of the application, a fundamental aspect of `whenever`'s functionality. Compromising `schedule.rb` processing can lead to arbitrary code execution through scheduled jobs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Malicious `schedule.rb` Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__malicious__schedule_rb__injection__critical_node_.md)

Critical Node Rationale: Injecting a malicious `schedule.rb` is a direct way to manipulate the application's scheduled tasks. If an attacker can replace or influence the content of `schedule.rb`, they can schedule their own malicious jobs to run on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Compromise Application Configuration to Modify `schedule.rb` Path [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__compromise_application_configuration_to_modify__schedule_rb__path__high-risk_path_.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works:  This attack path targets the configuration of the application that specifies the location of the `schedule.rb` file. If this path is configurable and the configuration mechanism is vulnerable, an attacker can change the path to point to a malicious `schedule.rb` file they control.
    *   Vulnerability Examples:
        *   Insecure Configuration Defaults:  Default configurations that are easily guessable or publicly accessible.
        *   Exposed Environment Variables: Sensitive environment variables containing configuration settings being unintentionally exposed (e.g., through web server misconfiguration or application logs).
        *   Application Vulnerabilities:  Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application (like Local File Inclusion, or Configuration File Injection) to directly write to or modify configuration files that control the `schedule.rb` path.
    *   Why High-Risk:  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to completely replace the legitimate `schedule.rb` with a malicious one, gaining full control over scheduled tasks. The effort is medium, and skill level is intermediate, making it a realistic threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Cron Command Generation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cron_command_generation__critical_node_.md)

Critical Node Rationale: This is the core vulnerability area within `whenever`.  If `whenever` incorrectly generates cron commands, especially with unsanitized inputs, it can lead to command injection, a highly critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Command Injection via Unescaped Arguments in Cron Commands [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__command_injection_via_unescaped_arguments_in_cron_commands__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works: This path exploits the way `whenever` constructs shell commands for cron jobs, particularly when using `command` or `runner` directives in `schedule.rb`. If arguments passed to these directives are not properly sanitized or escaped before being embedded in the cron command string, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
    *   Vulnerability Example:
        ```ruby
        # Vulnerable schedule.rb example
        every 1.day do
          command "ruby my_script.rb #{user_input}" # user_input is not sanitized
        end
        ```
        If `user_input` is controlled by an attacker and they provide input like `"; malicious_command #"` , the generated cron command might become: `ruby my_script.rb ; malicious_command #`.  The shell will execute both `my_script.rb` and `malicious_command`.
    *   Why High-Risk: Command injection is a highly critical vulnerability that allows for immediate Remote Code Execution. It is often relatively easy to exploit (low effort, beginner skill level if vulnerability exists) and has a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Inject Malicious Commands through Job Arguments [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__inject_malicious_commands_through_job_arguments__high-risk_path_.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works: This is a specific instance of command injection focusing on the arguments provided to the cron job commands.  If the application uses external or user-controlled data to construct arguments for `command` or `runner` in `schedule.rb` without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   Vulnerability Example:  As shown in the example above (2.1), using unsanitized `user_input` directly in the `command` directive.
    *   Why High-Risk:  Directly related to command injection, inheriting the same high-risk characteristics.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.2. Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization/Escaping in Whenever's Command Generation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_2__exploit_lack_of_input_sanitizationescaping_in_whenever's_command_generation__high-risk_path_f60f8042.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works: This path highlights the root cause of the command injection vulnerability: the absence or inadequacy of input sanitization and escaping within the application's code or potentially within `whenever` itself (though less likely in `whenever`'s core, more likely in how the application *uses* `whenever`). If the application fails to properly sanitize or escape data before using it in `command` or `runner` directives, command injection becomes possible.
    *   Mitigation Failure: This path emphasizes the failure to implement proper security controls (input validation and output encoding/escaping) during the development process.
    *   Why High-Risk: This is the fundamental weakness that enables command injection. Addressing this lack of sanitization is crucial for preventing this entire class of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Whenever Gem Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_whenever_gem_itself__critical_node_.md)

Critical Node Rationale:  Like any software dependency, `whenever` itself can have vulnerabilities. If the application uses a vulnerable version of `whenever`, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the gem to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Whenever Gem Versions [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_whenever_gem_versions__high-risk_path___critical__5cfc9b5a.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works: Attackers actively search for known vulnerabilities in specific versions of `whenever` (or its dependencies). Public vulnerability databases and security advisories are common sources of this information. If the application is using a vulnerable version, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits or develop their own to target these vulnerabilities.
    *   Vulnerability Examples:  Hypothetically, if a past version of `whenever` had a vulnerability that allowed arbitrary file write during crontab update, or a vulnerability in its parsing logic, attackers could exploit these. (Note: I am not aware of specific *known* RCE vulnerabilities in `whenever` itself at the time of writing, but this is a general dependency security principle).
    *   Why High-Risk:  Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often straightforward if the vulnerable version is in use. Exploit code might be readily available, lowering the effort and skill level required for the attacker. The impact is still critical (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Use Outdated and Vulnerable Whenever Gem Version [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__use_outdated_and_vulnerable_whenever_gem_version__high-risk_path_.md)

High-Risk Path Attack Vector:
    *   How it works: This is the direct action that makes the application vulnerable to dependency exploits.  If the development team fails to regularly update dependencies and uses an outdated version of `whenever`, they are leaving the application exposed to any known vulnerabilities present in that version.
    *   Mitigation Failure: This path highlights a failure in the software development lifecycle - neglecting dependency management and updates.
    *   Why High-Risk:  Using outdated software is a common and easily preventable security mistake. It significantly increases the likelihood of exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
