# Threat Model Analysis for javan/whenever

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into the commands defined in `schedule.rb` if they are dynamically constructed using unsanitized input. `whenever` would then generate a `crontab` file containing these malicious commands. When cron executes these jobs, the attacker's commands will be run on the server, potentially with the privileges of the cron user. This directly leverages `whenever`'s functionality to schedule and deploy commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, unauthorized access to data and resources, data breaches, denial of service, and execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Whenever Component Affected:** `schedule.rb` (job definition), Generated `crontab` (propagation of malicious commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing commands in `schedule.rb` whenever possible.
        *   If dynamic command construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input used to build commands.
        *   Utilize parameterized commands or shell escaping functions provided by Ruby to prevent command injection.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for the user account running cron jobs. Avoid running jobs as `root`.
        *   Conduct regular code reviews of `schedule.rb` and related code for potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of `schedule.rb`](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of__schedule_rb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's codebase (e.g., through compromised developer accounts, insecure repositories, or application vulnerabilities) could directly modify the `schedule.rb` file. By injecting malicious job definitions into `schedule.rb`, the attacker can use `whenever`'s deployment mechanism to schedule arbitrary commands to be executed by cron on the server. This directly abuses the intended workflow of `whenever` to introduce malicious cron jobs.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the server, persistent backdoors, data manipulation, denial of service, and full compromise of the application and potentially the server.
    *   **Whenever Component Affected:** `schedule.rb`, `whenever` deployment process (`whenever --update-crontab`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access control measures for the application's codebase and development environment.
        *   Use version control systems and restrict write access to `schedule.rb` to authorized personnel only.
        *   Enforce mandatory code reviews for all changes to `schedule.rb` to detect malicious or unintended modifications.
        *   Follow secure development practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized code modification.
        *   Secure the deployment process to prevent unauthorized modifications during deployment. Utilize automated deployment pipelines with integrity checks.
