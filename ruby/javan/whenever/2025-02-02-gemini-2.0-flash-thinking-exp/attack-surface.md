# Attack Surface Analysis for javan/whenever

## Attack Surface: [Crontab Injection via Unsanitized Job Definitions](./attack_surfaces/crontab_injection_via_unsanitized_job_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious commands are injected into the generated `crontab` file due to insufficient sanitization of job definitions, especially when dynamically generated from external input.
*   **Whenever Contribution:** `Whenever` parses the `Wheneverfile` and directly generates the `crontab` file. It does not inherently sanitize job definitions. If the `Wheneverfile` contains unsanitized input used to construct commands, `whenever` will faithfully translate this into a vulnerable `crontab` configuration.
*   **Example:** A developer uses user-provided input to name a job, without sanitizing it. An attacker provides input like `; rm -rf / #` which gets incorporated into the `crontab` command within the generated `crontab` file. When `cron` executes this, it leads to deletion of system files.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Rigorously sanitize and validate *all* external input used in `Wheneverfile` job definitions. Employ parameterized commands or robust shell escaping techniques to prevent command injection.
    *   **Minimize Dynamic Generation:** Avoid dynamically generating job definitions from untrusted sources whenever possible. Prefer static configurations defined directly in the `Wheneverfile`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Cron User:** Ensure the user account running cron jobs has the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from command execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in `Wheneverfile` or Generated Crontab](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in__wheneverfile__or_generated_crontab.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or internal paths are inadvertently hardcoded in the `Wheneverfile` or become part of the generated `crontab`, making them vulnerable to exposure.
*   **Whenever Contribution:** `Whenever` directly reads and processes the `Wheneverfile` and includes the defined commands and arguments verbatim in the generated `crontab`. It offers no built-in mechanisms to detect or prevent the inclusion of sensitive information.
*   **Example:** A developer includes database credentials directly in a job command within the `Wheneverfile` like `command "backup_script.sh --db-user=admin --db-password=P@$$wOrd"`. If the `Wheneverfile` or the generated `crontab` is exposed (e.g., through version control, server misconfiguration, or unauthorized access), these credentials are compromised.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data, potential data breaches, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Environment Variables:**  Store and access sensitive information exclusively through environment variables, referencing them within the `Wheneverfile` instead of hardcoding values.
    *   **Secure Secret Management:** Integrate with secure secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to manage and inject secrets into cron jobs securely, avoiding direct exposure in configuration files.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Implement strict access controls and permissions for the `Wheneverfile` and the generated `crontab` file, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `Wheneverfile` and generated `crontab` to identify and remove any inadvertently hardcoded sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through Misconfigured Cron Jobs](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through_misconfigured_cron_jobs.md)

*   **Description:** Cron jobs configured using `whenever` might be unintentionally set up to run with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` within job commands or running cron as root). Vulnerabilities in the commands or scripts executed by these privileged jobs can then be exploited to escalate privileges.
*   **Whenever Contribution:** `Whenever` simplifies the definition of cron jobs, including those that might involve `sudo` or be scheduled under a root cron context. While `whenever` itself doesn't *cause* privilege escalation, it facilitates the *configuration* of potentially risky privileged jobs if developers are not cautious.
*   **Example:** A `Wheneverfile` defines a job using `sudo` to execute a script that, due to a coding error, is vulnerable to command injection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, gaining full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain root or administrator level access to the system, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adhere to Least Privilege:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege. Run cron jobs with the absolute minimum privileges required for their intended function. Avoid using `sudo` in job commands unless absolutely necessary and after thorough security review.
    *   **Secure Script Development:**  Develop and thoroughly test all scripts and commands executed by cron jobs, especially those running with elevated privileges. Implement robust input validation, error handling, and secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Reviews of Cron Configurations:** Periodically review all cron job configurations defined in the `Wheneverfile` to identify and rectify any unnecessary or risky privilege escalations.
    *   **Containerization and Isolation:** Consider running cron jobs within isolated containers or virtual environments to limit the potential impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities on the host system.
