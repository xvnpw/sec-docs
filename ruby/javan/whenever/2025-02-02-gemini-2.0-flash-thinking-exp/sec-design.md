# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities:
  - Automate the scheduling of recurring tasks and jobs.
  - Simplify the management and configuration of cron jobs.
  - Improve the readability and maintainability of scheduled task definitions.
- Business Goals:
  - Provide a developer-friendly way to define cron jobs using Ruby code.
  - Abstract away the complexities of manual crontab file editing.
  - Ensure reliable and consistent execution of scheduled tasks.
- Business Risks:
  - Incorrectly configured or scheduled jobs leading to missed deadlines or errors.
  - Job failures due to misconfiguration or dependencies, impacting business processes.
  - Security vulnerabilities arising from insecure job commands or handling of sensitive data within jobs.
  - Unauthorized modification or deletion of scheduled jobs, disrupting operations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Operating System Level Security: Relies on the underlying operating system's security mechanisms for cron job execution and user permissions. Implemented by the OS.
  - security control: Gem Installation Security: Security of gem installation process, relying on RubyGems and network security during gem download. Implemented by RubyGems infrastructure and system package manager.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on OS Security: Inherits any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations present in the underlying operating system's cron implementation and user permission model.
  - accepted risk: Gem Supply Chain Risk: Potential risks associated with the RubyGems package repository and the gem supply chain.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Job Monitoring and Logging: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of job execution to detect failures, errors, and potential security incidents.
  - security control: Secure Parameter Handling: Ensure sensitive parameters used in job commands (e.g., passwords, API keys) are securely stored and accessed, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions, not hardcoded in job definitions.
  - security control: Input Validation for Job Commands: Validate and sanitize any external inputs or parameters used within job commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Least Privilege for Job Execution: Run cron jobs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of potential security breaches.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits: Periodically review cron job configurations and related scripts for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to 'whenever' gem itself, as it's a library for defining cron jobs.
    - Authentication is relevant in the context of the system where cron jobs are executed and managed, typically handled by OS-level user authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Authorization is crucial at the OS level to control which users can define, modify, and execute cron jobs.
    - 'whenever' relies on the OS's cron daemon authorization mechanisms.
    - Ensure proper user permissions are configured to restrict access to cron job management.
  - Input Validation:
    - Input validation is essential for any parameters or external data used within the commands executed by cron jobs.
    - 'whenever' itself does not perform input validation on job commands; this must be implemented in the scripts or applications executed by the jobs.
    - Validate all inputs to prevent command injection and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography may be required if cron jobs handle sensitive data or credentials.
    - 'whenever' does not directly provide cryptographic features.
    - Implement encryption for storing sensitive job parameters or data processed by jobs, using appropriate cryptographic libraries and techniques within the job scripts or applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes Protected:
  - The 'whenever' gem itself doesn't directly protect a specific business process. Instead, it facilitates the reliable execution of scheduled tasks that are crucial for various business processes. The criticality depends on the jobs scheduled using 'whenever'. Examples of business processes that might rely on cron jobs scheduled by 'whenever' include:
    - Data backups
    - Report generation
    - System maintenance tasks
    - Batch processing
    - Scheduled data synchronization
- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Their Sensitivity:
  - 'whenever' itself primarily deals with cron job definitions, which are typically configuration data. The sensitivity of this data is generally low.
  - However, the commands executed by cron jobs scheduled by 'whenever' might handle sensitive data. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the nature of the scheduled tasks. Examples of sensitive data that might be processed by cron jobs include:
    - Database credentials
    - API keys
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    - Financial data
    - Intellectual property
  - The sensitivity level should be assessed based on the specific jobs being scheduled and the data they process. If jobs handle sensitive data, appropriate security measures must be implemented to protect that data throughout the job execution lifecycle.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to simplify cron job management and improve the reliability of scheduled tasks.
  - Question: What is the scale of cron job usage? Is it for a small application or a large enterprise system with numerous critical scheduled tasks?
  - Question: What are the business impact of failures in scheduled tasks? Are there strict SLAs or deadlines associated with these tasks?
- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Security is primarily managed at the OS level, and 'whenever' inherits the security posture of the underlying system.
  - Question: Are there specific security compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that apply to the systems using 'whenever'?
  - Question: What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies and cron job configurations?
- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: 'whenever' is used within a standard Ruby on Rails or similar web application environment.
  - Question: What is the target deployment environment (cloud, on-premises, containerized)? Are there specific infrastructure security constraints?
  - Question: Are there any specific integrations with other systems or services that cron jobs need to interact with? What are the security implications of these integrations?
