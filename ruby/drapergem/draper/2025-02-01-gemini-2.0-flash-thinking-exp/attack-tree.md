## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Draper Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_draper_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal. Attackers aim to compromise the application specifically by exploiting weaknesses related to the use of Draper decorators.
*   **Likelihood:** Overall likelihood depends on the presence of vulnerabilities in the Draper implementation within the application.
*   **Impact:** Successful compromise can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, manipulation of application behavior, and reputational damage.
*   **Effort:** Effort varies depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
*   **Skill Level:** Skill level varies depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Detection difficulty varies depending on the specific vulnerability exploited and security monitoring in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Data Handling Issues in Decorators [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_data_handling_issues_in_decorators__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities related to how decorators handle and present data. This is a high-risk area because decorators are directly involved in rendering data in views, making them a prime location for presentation-layer vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Data handling vulnerabilities, especially XSS, are common in web applications.
*   **Impact:** High - Data breaches, account compromise, malware distribution, defacement.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploiting data handling issues can range from simple input manipulation to more complex injection techniques.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic to intermediate web security knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable with proper security measures, but requires vigilance.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Decorator Output [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_decorator_output__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to inject malicious scripts into data that is processed and displayed by decorators without proper sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerabilities in the application's views. This is a *primary* critical node within data handling issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - XSS is a prevalent web vulnerability, and decorators, if not handled carefully, can be a source.
*   **Impact:** High - Full account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploiting XSS can be relatively easy if output encoding is missing.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic to intermediate web security knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable with security scanning and code reviews, but requires consistent effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploiting Lack of Output Encoding in Decorators [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploiting_lack_of_output_encoding_in_decorators__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical and high-risk attack vector. Attackers exploit situations where decorators fail to properly escape or encode data before rendering it in views, especially user-generated content or data from untrusted sources.
*   **Likelihood:** High -  Developers may forget or neglect output encoding, especially when dealing with dynamic data in decorators.
*   **Impact:** High - Full account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement.
*   **Effort:** Low - Simply providing malicious input to vulnerable fields.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium - Output encoding issues are often detectable with automated scanners and code reviews.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Mandatory Output Encoding:**  Enforce strict output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) within all decorators when rendering data. Use Rails' `h` helper or similar methods consistently.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Specifically review decorator code to ensure output encoding is always implemented correctly.
    *   **Automated Security Scanning:** Use security scanners that can detect potential XSS vulnerabilities, including those related to output encoding.
    *   **Developer Training:** Train developers on the importance of output encoding and how to implement it correctly in decorators.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of Draper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_draper__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities arising from incorrect implementation or configuration of Draper within the application. Misuse, especially leading to inconsistent decoration, is a high-risk path.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Misconfiguration and misuse are common in software development.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to XSS vulnerabilities, information disclosure, and other security issues.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploiting misconfigurations can range from simple observation to more targeted attacks.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic to intermediate web security knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable through code reviews, security audits, and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Inconsistent Decoration or Missing Decoration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__inconsistent_decoration_or_missing_decoration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Inconsistent application of decorators across the application or forgetting to decorate data in certain views can lead to vulnerabilities. This is a critical node within misconfiguration/misuse.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Inconsistency and oversights are common in larger projects or teams.
*   **Impact:** High - XSS vulnerabilities if unescaped data is rendered due to missing decoration.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Identifying missing decoration can be done through code analysis and application testing.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic to intermediate web security knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected through code reviews, security scanning, and penetration testing, but requires thorough coverage.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Forgetting to Decorate Data in Specific Views [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__forgetting_to_decorate_data_in_specific_views__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a highly specific and high-risk attack vector. Developers overlooking the need to decorate data in certain views, leading to raw, unescaped data being rendered, directly resulting in potential XSS.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common oversight in development, especially in larger applications or during rapid development cycles.
*   **Impact:** High - XSS vulnerabilities if unescaped data is rendered.
*   **Effort:** Low - Simply finding views where data is not decorated.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected through code reviews, security scanning, and penetration testing, but requires thorough coverage of all views.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Consistent Decoration Strategy:**  Establish clear guidelines and patterns for when and how to use decorators throughout the application. Document these guidelines clearly.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Specifically check for consistent decoration practices during code reviews.
    *   **Automated Checks (Linters/Static Analysis):** Explore the possibility of using linters or static analysis tools to detect instances where data might be rendered without decoration (though this can be challenging to implement effectively).
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Test all views and data rendering paths to ensure consistent and secure decoration. Penetration testing should specifically target views for missing decoration vulnerabilities.
