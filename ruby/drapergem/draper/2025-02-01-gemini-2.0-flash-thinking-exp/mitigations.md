# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for drapergem/draper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Decorators](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_decorators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review:**  Developers should systematically review each decorator class and every method within them.
    2.  **Identify Data Exposure:** For each decorator method, explicitly identify what data from the underlying model or other sources is being exposed to the view *through the decorator*.
    3.  **Necessity Assessment:**  Evaluate if all data exposed *by the decorator* is absolutely necessary for the intended presentation purpose in the specific view context where the decorator is used.
    4.  **Data Restriction:** If any data exposed *by the decorator* is deemed unnecessary or sensitive for the presentation layer, remove the code within the decorator that exposes it.  This might involve removing method calls, attribute access, or filtering the data before it's rendered *by the decorator*.
    5.  **Contextualization:**  Implement conditional logic within decorators or create context-aware decorators. This means the decorator's behavior and data exposure should adapt based on the user's role, permissions, or the specific view being rendered. For example, an `AdminUserDecorator` might expose more data than a standard `UserDecorator`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to sensitive data through decorators that expose more information than necessary. This threat is *directly introduced by how decorators are designed to present data*.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Unintentional leakage of internal application details or model attributes that are not meant to be publicly visible, potentially aiding attackers in understanding the system's structure *due to overly verbose decorators*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure: High:**  Significantly reduces the risk of data exposure by limiting the data accessible *through decorators* to only what is strictly required for presentation.
    *   **Information Disclosure: Medium:** Reduces the risk of unintentional information disclosure by carefully controlling what data is presented *in the view layer via decorators*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews for data exposure have been conducted for `UserDecorator` and `ProductDecorator`.  These reviews resulted in removing direct access to sensitive attributes like `user.password_digest` within the `UserDecorator`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Data exposure review and implementation of least privilege principles are missing for the following decorators: `OrderDecorator`, `CommentDecorator`, `ShoppingCartDecorator`, and all newly created decorators.
    *   Context-aware decorators are not yet implemented.  There is no mechanism to dynamically adjust data exposure *within decorators* based on user roles or view contexts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Exposing Internal Implementation Details](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_exposing_internal_implementation_details.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Abstraction Layer:**  Instead of directly accessing model attributes or internal methods within decorators, introduce an abstraction layer in the model. This can be achieved by creating dedicated methods in the model that encapsulate data access and business logic.
    2.  **Decorator Method Redirection:**  Modify decorator methods to call these newly created model methods instead of directly accessing attributes or internal model logic *within the decorator*.
    3.  **Focus on Presentation:** Ensure decorator methods primarily focus on formatting and presenting data retrieved from the model methods, rather than performing data retrieval or manipulation themselves *within the decorator*.
    4.  **Review Model Methods:**  Carefully review the newly created model methods to ensure they adhere to security best practices, including authorization checks and data sanitization, as these methods will now be the primary data providers *for decorators*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents decorators from inadvertently leaking internal model structure, relationships, or method names that could be exploited by attackers *due to direct model access within decorators*.
    *   **Logic Bugs (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of introducing logic bugs in decorators by separating presentation logic from core business logic, making both easier to manage and test *within the decorator layer*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure: Medium:**  Reduces the risk of information disclosure by abstracting data access and preventing decorators from directly revealing internal model details *through decorator code*.
    *   **Logic Bugs: Low to Medium:**  Reduces the likelihood of logic errors in decorators by simplifying their role and separating concerns *within the decorator*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  For `UserDecorator`, some direct attribute access has been replaced with calls to model methods like `user.public_name` instead of `user.name`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Abstraction of internal details is not consistently applied across all decorators.  `ProductDecorator`, `OrderDecorator`, and `CommentDecorator` still heavily rely on direct attribute access *within their code*.
    *   A systematic review and refactoring are needed to introduce model methods for data access for all relevant models used with decorators.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Output in Decorators](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_output_in_decorators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Points:**  Pinpoint all locations within decorator methods where data is being rendered or outputted to the view (e.g., using string interpolation, HTML helpers, or JavaScript generation *within decorator methods*).
    2.  **Contextual Sanitization:** Determine the appropriate sanitization method based on the output context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL).
    3.  **Apply Sanitization:**  Use Rails' built-in sanitization helpers (`html_escape`, `sanitize`, `javascript_escape`, `url_encode`) or dedicated sanitization libraries (like `bleach` for more advanced HTML sanitization) to sanitize data before outputting it *in decorators*.
    4.  **Default Escaping:** Ensure that Rails' default HTML escaping is enabled and understood. Be aware of situations where you might need to use `raw` or `html_safe` and use them with extreme caution, only after careful sanitization *within decorators*.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review decorators to ensure sanitization is consistently applied, especially when new features or data sources are introduced *that are handled by decorators*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious scripts into the application through unsanitized data displayed by decorators. XSS can lead to account hijacking, data theft, and website defacement. This threat is *directly relevant to how decorators render data in views*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High:**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring data displayed *through decorators* is properly sanitized, protecting users from malicious scripts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  Basic HTML escaping is generally relied upon by Rails' default templating.  However, explicit sanitization using `sanitize` or `html_escape` is not consistently applied within decorators.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic implementation of explicit sanitization within all decorators, especially for user-generated content or data from external sources *rendered by decorators*.
    *   No consistent use of `sanitize` or similar methods in `CommentDecorator`, `ProductDecorator` descriptions, or any decorator displaying user-provided text.
    *   Lack of JavaScript escaping in decorators that generate JavaScript code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Decorators Thin and Focused on Presentation](./mitigation_strategies/keep_decorators_thin_and_focused_on_presentation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Refactoring:**  Review all decorator methods and identify any code that performs business logic, authorization checks, data manipulation beyond simple formatting, or any operations that are not strictly related to presentation *within decorators*.
    2.  **Logic Relocation:**  Move identified business logic, authorization, and complex data manipulation out of decorators and into appropriate layers such as models, services, controllers, or policy objects.
    3.  **Decorator Simplification:**  Refactor decorator methods to solely focus on presentation tasks like formatting dates, currencies, displaying status indicators, or composing display strings from pre-processed data *within decorators*.
    4.  **Enforce Separation of Concerns:**  Establish coding guidelines and code review processes to ensure that developers understand and adhere to the principle of keeping decorators thin and presentation-focused in future development.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Bugs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of introducing logic errors in decorators, which are harder to test and maintain when they contain complex logic *within the decorator layer*.
    *   **Authorization Bypass (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional placement of authorization logic in decorators, which could lead to inconsistent or bypassed security checks *if authorization were attempted in decorators*.
    *   **Code Complexity (Medium Severity):** Simplifies code maintenance and auditing by keeping decorators focused and reducing overall code complexity *within the decorator layer*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Bugs: Medium:** Reduces the risk of logic bugs by simplifying decorators and moving complex logic to more appropriate layers.
    *   **Authorization Bypass: Medium:** Reduces the risk of authorization bypass by preventing authorization logic from being placed in decorators.
    *   **Code Complexity: Medium:** Improves code maintainability and auditability by keeping decorators focused and simple.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  There is a general awareness of keeping decorators presentation-focused, but some decorators still contain minor business logic or data manipulation beyond simple formatting.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic refactoring to remove all non-presentation logic from existing decorators.
    *   Enforcement of strict guidelines during code reviews to prevent future decorators from becoming bloated with business logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Performing Actions or Side Effects in Decorators](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_performing_actions_or_side_effects_in_decorators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Audit for Side Effects:**  Thoroughly audit all decorator methods to identify any code that performs actions with side effects, such as database updates, API calls, sending emails, or modifying application state *from within decorators*.
    2.  **Side Effect Removal:**  Remove any code that performs side effects from decorators. Relocate these actions to controllers, services, or background jobs where side effects are expected and can be managed appropriately.
    3.  **Idempotency Principle:**  Ensure that decorator methods are idempotent, meaning they produce the same output given the same input and do not alter the application's state *through decorator execution*.
    4.  **Testing for Side Effects:**  Include tests specifically designed to verify that decorators do not produce any unintended side effects.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected application behavior caused by side effects triggered unintentionally or in unexpected contexts *through decorators*.
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities due to side effects in decorators that might be triggered without proper authorization or validation *if side effects were present in decorators*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Prevents potential data integrity issues if side effects in decorators are executed inconsistently or in incorrect order *due to decorator logic*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior: Medium:** Reduces the risk of unexpected application behavior by ensuring decorators are purely presentational and do not have side effects.
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities: Medium:** Reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities arising from unintended side effects in decorators.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues: Medium:** Reduces the risk of data integrity problems caused by inconsistent or incorrect execution of side effects in decorators.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented.  There is a general understanding within the development team to avoid side effects in decorators.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review process specifically focused on identifying and eliminating potential side effects in decorators.
    *   Automated tests to explicitly verify the idempotency of decorators and the absence of side effects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Review and Test Decorator Methods](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_review_and_test_decorator_methods.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all new decorators and modifications to existing decorators. Code reviews should specifically focus on security aspects, logic correctness, and adherence to best practices *within decorator code*.
    2.  **Security-Focused Review Checklist:**  Develop a checklist for code reviewers to ensure they specifically look for potential security vulnerabilities in decorators, such as data exposure, lack of sanitization, or unintended side effects *within decorator implementations*.
    3.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests for individual decorator methods to verify their logic and output. Implement integration tests to ensure decorators function correctly within the application's view rendering process.
    4.  **Security Testing:**  Include security testing as part of the testing process for decorators. This could involve manual security testing or automated security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities *specifically in decorators*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Draper-Related Threats (Varying Severity):**  Proactive review and testing helps to identify and mitigate all types of security threats that can be introduced through Draper, including data exposure, XSS, logic bugs, and unexpected behavior *originating from decorator usage*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Draper-Related Threats: High:**  Significantly reduces the overall risk by proactively identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before they reach production *in the decorator layer*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews are generally practiced, but a specific security-focused checklist for decorators is not yet in place. Unit tests exist for some decorators, but coverage is not comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security-focused code review checklist for decorators.
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration test suite for all decorators, including security-specific test cases.
    *   Integration of security testing tools or processes into the decorator development workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Decorator Logic and Queries](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_decorator_logic_and_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Performance Profiling:**  Use performance profiling tools to identify slow or resource-intensive operations within decorators, particularly database queries *executed by decorators*.
    2.  **Query Optimization:**  Optimize database queries performed within decorators. Utilize eager loading (`includes`, `preload`) to prevent N+1 query problems.  Refactor complex queries for efficiency *within decorator methods*.
    3.  **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., fragment caching, memoization) for frequently accessed data within decorators, especially if the data is relatively static or can be cached for a reasonable duration.
    4.  **Efficient Algorithms:**  Ensure that any logic within decorators (even presentation logic) is implemented using efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize processing time *within decorators*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents decorators from becoming performance bottlenecks that could be exploited to cause DoS attacks by overloading the application with resource-intensive requests *due to inefficient decorators*.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Avoids general performance degradation of the application caused by inefficient decorators, leading to slow response times and poor user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS): Medium to High:** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks by optimizing decorator performance and preventing them from becoming exploitable bottlenecks.
    *   **Performance Degradation: Medium:** Improves overall application performance and user experience by ensuring decorators are efficient and do not introduce performance overhead.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  Basic awareness of performance considerations exists, and some eager loading is used in certain decorators.  However, systematic performance profiling and optimization are not consistently applied *to decorators*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular performance profiling of decorators to identify bottlenecks.
    *   Systematic optimization of database queries within decorators, including consistent use of eager loading and query refactoring.
    *   Implementation of caching strategies for frequently accessed data in decorators.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Decorator Performance](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_decorator_performance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Performance Monitoring Tools:** Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus) into the application to track the performance of requests that involve decorator rendering.
    2.  **Metric Tracking:**  Configure monitoring tools to specifically track metrics related to decorator execution time, database query counts triggered by decorators, and overall request latency *attributable to decorators*.
    3.  **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify developers when decorator performance degrades or exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating potential performance issues or DoS vulnerabilities *related to decorators*.
    4.  **Log Analysis:**  Analyze application logs to identify patterns of slow decorator execution or errors related to decorator performance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity):**  Early detection of performance degradation in decorators allows for timely intervention to prevent potential DoS attacks *stemming from decorator inefficiency*.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Proactive monitoring helps identify and address performance issues caused by decorators before they significantly impact user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS): Medium to High:**  Improves the ability to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks by monitoring decorator performance.
    *   **Performance Degradation: Medium:**  Enables proactive identification and resolution of performance issues related to decorators, maintaining good application performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  Basic performance monitoring is in place for the application as a whole, but specific metrics and alerts focused on decorator performance are not yet configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of performance monitoring tools to specifically track decorator performance metrics.
    *   Setup of alerts for decorator performance degradation.
    *   Integration of decorator performance analysis into regular performance review processes.
