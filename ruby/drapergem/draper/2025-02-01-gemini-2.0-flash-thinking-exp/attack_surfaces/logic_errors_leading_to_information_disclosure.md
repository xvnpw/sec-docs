### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Logic Errors Leading to Information Disclosure in Draper Decorators

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Surface in Draper Decorators

Draper decorators are designed to encapsulate presentation logic, separating it from models and controllers. This separation is beneficial for code organization and maintainability. However, when decorators incorporate conditional logic to tailor the presentation based on authorization or data sensitivity, they become a potential point of security vulnerability.

The core issue arises when the logic within decorators, intended to control *what* information is displayed to *whom*, contains flaws. These flaws can lead to situations where:

*   **Unauthorized users gain access to sensitive information:**  Incorrect conditional checks might inadvertently display data to users who should not have access.
*   **Data intended to be filtered is exposed:** Logic meant to redact or hide certain attributes based on user roles might fail, revealing confidential details.
*   **Presentation logic becomes intertwined with authorization logic:**  Decorators, meant for presentation, start making authorization decisions, often leading to complex and error-prone code.

Draper's flexibility, while powerful for customization, amplifies this risk. Developers can easily embed complex conditional logic within decorators, increasing the likelihood of introducing subtle but critical errors.

#### 4.2. Specific Vulnerability Scenarios and Examples

Let's explore concrete scenarios where logic errors in Draper decorators can lead to information disclosure:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Boolean Logic in Role-Based Display**

Imagine a decorator for `User` model that conditionally displays salary information only to administrators.

```ruby
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def salary_info
    if object.is_admin? || !object.salary.nil? # Vulnerable logic: OR instead of AND
      h.content_tag(:p, "Salary: #{object.salary}")
    else
      nil
    end
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:** The condition `object.is_admin? || !object.salary.nil?` uses an OR operator. This means the salary will be displayed if the user is an admin **OR** if the salary is not nil (i.e., exists).  This is incorrect; the intention was likely to show salary only to admins AND when salary is present.  Any user with a non-null salary, regardless of their admin status, will see the salary information.

**Exploitation:** A non-admin user with a salary record will inadvertently see their salary displayed, violating the intended access control.

**Corrected Code:**

```ruby
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def salary_info
    if object.is_admin? && !object.salary.nil? # Corrected logic: AND operator
      h.content_tag(:p, "Salary: #{object.salary}")
    else
      nil
    end
  end
end
```

**Scenario 2: Missing Role Check for Sensitive Data**

Consider a decorator for a `Document` model where sensitive documents should only be viewable by authorized personnel.

```ruby
# app/decorators/document_decorator.rb
class DocumentDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def content_preview
    if object.is_sensitive? # Missing role check!
      h.content_tag(:div, "Sensitive Content: #{object.content.truncate(100)}")
    else
      h.content_tag(:div, "Content Preview: #{object.content.truncate(100)}")
    end
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:** The decorator checks `object.is_sensitive?` but **fails to check the user's role or permissions**. If a document is marked as sensitive, it *still* displays a preview to *all* users, even though the intention was likely to restrict access based on user roles.

**Exploitation:** Any user, regardless of their authorization level, can potentially see a preview of sensitive document content, even if they shouldn't have access to the full document.

**Corrected Code (assuming a `current_user` helper is available in the decorator context):**

```ruby
# app/decorators/document_decorator.rb
class DocumentDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all
  delegate :current_user, to: :helpers # Assuming current_user is accessible

  def content_preview
    if object.is_sensitive? && current_user.is_authorized_for_sensitive_data? # Added role check
      h.content_tag(:div, "Sensitive Content Preview (Authorized): #{object.content.truncate(100)}")
    else
      h.content_tag(:div, "Content Preview: #{object.content.truncate(100)}")
    end
  end
end
```

**Scenario 3: Type Coercion and Implicit Truthiness Issues**

Ruby's dynamic typing and implicit truthiness can lead to unexpected behavior in conditional logic.

```ruby
# app/decorators/product_decorator.rb
class ProductDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def discount_badge
    discount_percentage = object.discount_percentage
    if discount_percentage # Implicit truthiness - 0 is considered truthy in Ruby!
      h.content_tag(:span, "Discount: #{discount_percentage}%", class: 'discount-badge')
    else
      nil
    end
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:** In Ruby, numbers other than `nil` and `false` are considered "truthy".  If `discount_percentage` is `0` (meaning no discount), the condition `if discount_percentage` will still evaluate to true, and the discount badge will be displayed, potentially misleading users.

**Exploitation:** Products with no discount (discount percentage of 0) might incorrectly display a discount badge, leading to user confusion or misrepresentation of product pricing. While not direct information disclosure of sensitive data, it's a logic error with potential business impact. In other scenarios, type coercion issues could lead to more severe information disclosure.

**Corrected Code:**

```ruby
# app/decorators/product_decorator.rb
class ProductDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def discount_badge
    discount_percentage = object.discount_percentage
    if discount_percentage.to_i > 0 # Explicitly check if greater than 0
      h.content_tag(:span, "Discount: #{discount_percentage}%", class: 'discount-badge')
    else
      nil
    end
  end
end
```

#### 4.3. Impact and Risk Severity

Logic errors leading to information disclosure in Draper decorators carry a **High** risk severity due to the potential for:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data, such as salaries, personal information, confidential documents, or internal system details, can be exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Significant Information Disclosure:**  Even seemingly minor information leaks can have significant consequences, depending on the sensitivity of the data and the context.
*   **Financial Fraud or Misuse:** In scenarios involving financial data or privileged information, disclosure can lead to financial fraud, internal misuse of information, or regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Information disclosure incidents can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode user trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:** Depending on the nature of the disclosed data and applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), organizations may face legal and regulatory penalties.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of logic errors leading to information disclosure in Draper decorators, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Simplify Decorator Logic and Minimize Conditional Statements:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Decorators:** Decorators should primarily focus on presentation formatting and styling. Avoid embedding complex authorization or data filtering logic directly within decorators.
    *   **Push Complex Logic to Model or Service Layers:**  Move complex conditional logic, especially related to authorization and data access control, to model methods, service objects, or dedicated authorization layers (e.g., policy objects). Decorators should then rely on these pre-computed or pre-determined results.
    *   **Favor Simple Conditions:** When conditional logic is necessary in decorators, strive for simplicity and clarity. Avoid nested conditions or overly complex boolean expressions.

2.  **Rigorous Unit Testing of Decorator Logic (Especially Conditional Branches):**
    *   **Focus on Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**  Thoroughly test all conditional branches within decorators, paying particular attention to edge cases, boundary conditions, and different user roles/permissions.
    *   **Test for Different User Roles and Permissions:**  Write unit tests that explicitly simulate different user roles and permission levels to ensure that decorators behave as expected under various authorization contexts.
    *   **Utilize Mocking and Stubbing:**  Isolate decorator logic by mocking or stubbing dependencies (e.g., model methods, helper methods) to focus testing on the decorator's conditional logic itself.
    *   **Code Coverage Analysis:** Use code coverage tools to ensure that all conditional branches within decorators are adequately tested.

3.  **Dedicated Code Reviews Focused on Security Logic in Decorators:**
    *   **Security-Focused Reviews:** Conduct code reviews specifically targeting security-related logic within decorators. Reviewers should be trained to identify potential logic flaws, authorization bypasses, and information disclosure vulnerabilities.
    *   **Peer Reviews:** Implement mandatory peer reviews for all code changes involving decorators, especially those containing conditional logic or handling sensitive data.
    *   **Checklists and Guidelines:** Develop security code review checklists and guidelines specific to Draper decorators to ensure consistent and thorough reviews.

4.  **Centralized Authorization and Policy Enforcement:**
    *   **Implement a Centralized Authorization System:**  Utilize a dedicated authorization system (e.g., policy objects, authorization gems like Pundit or CanCanCan) to manage access control logic outside of decorators.
    *   **Decorators as Presentation Layers, Not Authorization Points:**  Decorators should rely on authorization decisions made by the centralized system. They should not be responsible for making authorization decisions themselves.
    *   **Pre-compute Authorization Decisions:**  Fetch authorization decisions (e.g., "can_view_salary?") in controllers or service layers and pass these pre-computed boolean values to decorators for presentation logic.

5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (While Less Direct, Still Relevant):**
    *   **Validate Inputs in Controllers and Models:** While decorators primarily handle output, ensure that input data used in decorator logic (e.g., user roles, permissions) is properly validated and sanitized in controllers and models to prevent data integrity issues that could indirectly affect decorator logic.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Include Decorators in Security Assessments:**  Ensure that security audits and penetration testing activities specifically include a review of Draper decorators and their potential for information disclosure vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Security Scanning:** Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan code for potential logic errors and security vulnerabilities in decorators.

7.  **Developer Training and Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers about the risks of logic errors in decorators and the importance of secure coding practices.
    *   **Draper-Specific Security Guidelines:**  Develop and disseminate internal security guidelines and best practices specifically for developing secure Draper decorators.
    *   **Promote Secure Design Principles:**  Encourage developers to adopt secure design principles, such as the principle of least privilege and separation of concerns, when working with decorators.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of logic errors in Draper decorators leading to information disclosure and build more secure Ruby on Rails applications.  Focusing on simplicity, rigorous testing, and centralized authorization is key to minimizing this attack surface.
