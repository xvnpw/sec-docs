# Threat Model Analysis for drapergem/draper

## Threat: [Business Logic Flaws in Decorators Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/business_logic_flaws_in_decorators_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit flaws in business logic implemented within decorators to bypass authorization checks or gain unauthorized access to features or data. For example, if a decorator incorrectly determines user permissions, an attacker could gain access to administrative functions or premium content without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Integrity violation, unauthorized access to application features and data, potential privilege escalation. Could lead to data manipulation, system compromise, and financial loss.

**Draper Component Affected:** Decorator classes, specifically methods within decorators that implement conditional logic or business rules related to access control or feature availability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Separate Concerns: Avoid implementing core business logic within decorators. Keep decorators focused on presentation logic only.
*   Centralized Authorization: Implement authorization logic in dedicated services or policy objects, not within decorators. Decorators should call these services for authorization decisions.
*   Unit Testing: Thoroughly unit test decorator logic, especially any conditional statements or logic related to authorization.
*   Security Testing: Conduct security testing, including penetration testing, to identify potential authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Decorator Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unescaped_decorator_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into user-provided data (e.g., user profile bio) that is then rendered by a decorator without proper escaping. When other users view the decorated output, the malicious script will execute in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the application.

**Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity violation, user session hijacking, website defacement, malware distribution. Can lead to reputational damage and loss of user trust.

**Draper Component Affected:** Decorator methods that generate HTML output, particularly when displaying user-provided data or data from external sources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   HTML Escaping: Always escape HTML output generated by decorators, especially when displaying user-provided data or data from external sources.
*   Rails Helpers: Utilize Rails' built-in HTML escaping helpers (e.g., `h`, `sanitize`) within decorators.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
*   Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in the database to prevent injection of malicious code in the first place.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities in Draper or its Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_draper_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities in the Draper gem itself or its dependencies. If the application uses a vulnerable version of Draper or a vulnerable dependency, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause other harm to the application and server.

**Impact:** Confidentiality, integrity, and availability violation. Potential for remote code execution, data breach, and full system compromise.

**Draper Component Affected:** Draper gem library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Dependency Updates: Keep Draper and all its dependencies up to date with the latest versions. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Security Monitoring: Subscribe to security advisories for Draper and its dependencies to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   Vulnerability Management Process: Implement a process for promptly patching or upgrading dependencies when vulnerabilities are discovered and reported.
*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the application and its dependencies to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
