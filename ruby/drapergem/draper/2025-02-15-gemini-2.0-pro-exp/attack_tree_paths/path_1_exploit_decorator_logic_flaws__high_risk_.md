# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the "Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws" path within the attack tree, identifying specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and effective mitigation strategies related to the Draper gem.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on the identified attack tree path:

*   **Path 1: Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws**
    *   1.1 Input Validation Bypass in Decorator
        *   1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Logic Error
        *   1.1.2 Leverage Unintended Decorator Helpers

The analysis will consider vulnerabilities specific to the Draper gem's functionality and how it interacts with the broader Rails application.  It will *not* cover general Rails security best practices unless they are directly relevant to Draper's usage.  We assume the application uses a standard Rails setup with a relational database.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will hypothetically examine Draper decorator code examples, focusing on input handling, helper usage, and potential logic flaws.  Since we don't have the *actual* application code, we'll create representative examples to illustrate vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker perspectives and motivations to identify potential attack vectors within the defined scope.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will analyze identified potential vulnerabilities, assessing their likelihood, impact, required effort, attacker skill level, and detection difficulty.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.
5.  **Documentation:**  The analysis and recommendations will be documented in this markdown format.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 1. Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws (Root Node)

This is the entry point for the attack.  The attacker's overall goal is to find and exploit weaknesses in the *logic* of the Draper decorators.  This is distinct from, for example, exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying model or controller.  The attacker is specifically targeting the decorator layer.

### 1.1 Input Validation Bypass in Decorator

This node represents the core vulnerability.  The attacker aims to bypass any input validation that *should* be present within the decorator itself.  It's crucial to understand that even if the model has robust validations, the decorator can *introduce* new vulnerabilities if it processes user input directly without its own checks.

**Criticality:** High.  Successful bypass often leads directly to further exploitation.

#### 1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Logic Error

This is the *method* of achieving the input validation bypass.  The attacker crafts specific input designed to cause unexpected behavior in the decorator's methods.

**Example 1: String Concatenation without Length Check (Denial of Service)**

```ruby
# app/decorators/product_decorator.rb
class ProductDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  def formatted_description
    "#{object.description} - Special Offer: #{h.params[:offer_text]}"
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `formatted_description` method directly concatenates the `offer_text` parameter from the request without any length validation.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could provide an extremely long string for `offer_text`, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive memory or CPU resources.
*   **Mitigation:**
    ```ruby
    # app/decorators/product_decorator.rb
    class ProductDecorator < Draper::Decorator
      MAX_OFFER_LENGTH = 255

      def formatted_description
        offer = h.params[:offer_text].to_s.truncate(MAX_OFFER_LENGTH) # Truncate to a safe length
        "#{object.description} - Special Offer: #{offer}"
      end
    end
    ```
    This mitigation truncates the input to a safe maximum length.  Using `to_s` also helps prevent type confusion issues.

**Example 2:  SQL Injection (Indirect via Decorator)**

```ruby
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  def recent_activity
    # DANGEROUS:  Directly using params in a SQL query
    Activity.where("user_id = #{object.id} AND action = '#{h.params[:action]}'")
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  Even though the decorator doesn't *directly* handle user input for the `user_id`, it *does* directly use the `action` parameter in a SQL query without sanitization. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could provide a malicious value for the `action` parameter, such as `' OR 1=1; --`, to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Mitigation:**
    ```ruby
    # app/decorators/user_decorator.rb
    class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
      def recent_activity
        # Use parameterized query or ActiveRecord's safe query methods
        Activity.where("user_id = ? AND action = ?", object.id, h.params[:action])
      end
    end
    ```
    This uses a parameterized query, preventing SQL injection. ActiveRecord also provides other safe query methods.

**Example 3:  Type Confusion**

```ruby
# app/decorators/order_decorator.rb
class OrderDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  def discount_amount
    discount = h.params[:discount]
    # Assuming discount is a percentage (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
    object.total_price * discount
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The code assumes `discount` is a numeric value (likely a float).  If an attacker provides a string or an array, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  Ruby's dynamic typing makes this possible.
*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker might be able to cause an exception, potentially revealing information about the application, or even manipulate the calculation in unexpected ways.
*   **Mitigation:**
    ```ruby
    # app/decorators/order_decorator.rb
    class OrderDecorator < Draper::Decorator
      def discount_amount
        discount = h.params[:discount].to_f # Convert to float
        discount = 0.0 if discount < 0 || discount > 1 # Validate range
        object.total_price * discount
      end
    end
    ```
    This explicitly converts the input to a float and validates that it's within the expected range (0 to 1).

#### 1.1.2 Leverage Unintended Decorator Helpers

This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of helper methods within the decorator.

**Example 4:  XSS via `raw` or `html_safe`**

```ruby
# app/decorators/comment_decorator.rb
class CommentDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  def formatted_body
    # DANGEROUS:  Using raw on user-supplied content
    h.raw(object.body)
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `raw` helper method disables escaping, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  If `object.body` contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the `body` of a comment, which would then be executed when other users view the comment.
*   **Mitigation:**
    ```ruby
    # app/decorators/comment_decorator.rb
    class CommentDecorator < Draper::Decorator
      def formatted_body
        # Sanitize the content before rendering
        h.sanitize(object.body)
        # OR, better, use a dedicated HTML sanitizer:
        # h.sanitize(object.body, tags: %w(p br strong em), attributes: %w(href))
      end
    end
    ```
    This uses the `sanitize` helper to remove potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes.  The second example shows how to use `sanitize` with a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes for more fine-grained control.  *Never* use `raw` or `html_safe` on user-supplied data without proper sanitization.

**Example 5:  Unsafe URL Generation**

```ruby
# app/decorators/article_decorator.rb
class ArticleDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  def share_link
    # Potentially unsafe if h.params[:source] is not validated
    h.link_to "Share", "https://example.com/share?url=#{h.object_url}&source=#{h.params[:source]}"
  end
end
```

*   **Vulnerability:** If `h.params[:source]` is not validated, an attacker could inject a malicious URL, potentially redirecting users to a phishing site.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the `source` parameter to point to a malicious website.
*   **Mitigation:**
    ```ruby
    # app/decorators/article_decorator.rb
    class ArticleDecorator < Draper::Decorator
      ALLOWED_SOURCES = ['twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin']

      def share_link
        source = h.params[:source].to_s
        source = 'default' unless ALLOWED_SOURCES.include?(source) # Whitelist
        h.link_to "Share", "https://example.com/share?url=#{h.object_url}&source=#{source}"
      end
    end
    ```
    This uses a whitelist to restrict the allowed values for the `source` parameter.

## 3. Summary of Mitigations

The most important mitigation strategy is to **treat all data accessed within a decorator as potentially untrusted, even if it originates from the model.**  This includes data accessed via `h.params`, `object`, and even helper methods.

*   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement input validation *within the decorator* for all data, regardless of its source.  Use whitelisting whenever possible.
*   **Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input before using it in any operation, especially string manipulation, database queries, or HTML output.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Escape Output:** Escape output properly to prevent XSS.  Avoid `raw` and `html_safe` unless absolutely necessary, and *always* sanitize user input before using them.
*   **Type Checking:**  Be mindful of Ruby's dynamic typing.  Explicitly convert and validate data types when necessary.
*   **Helper Review:** Carefully review the use of any helper methods within decorators, especially those related to HTML generation or URL construction.
*   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on security aspects of decorators.
*   **Security Audits:** Consider periodic security audits by external experts.
*   **Keep Draper Updated:** Regularly update the Draper gem to benefit from security patches.

By implementing these mitigations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploiting decorator logic flaws and improve the overall security of the application.
