# Deep Analysis of Draper Decorator Authorization Bypass

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the attack path "Bypass Decorator Authorization/Access Control" specifically focusing on the sub-path "Misconfigured `allows` or `denies` -> Incorrectly Delegating Sensitive Methods" within the context of a Ruby on Rails application using the Draper gem.  The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities, understand their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.

**Scope:**

*   This analysis focuses solely on the Draper gem's authorization features (`allows`, `denies`, `decorates_finders`).
*   We assume the application uses Draper to decorate model objects and expose specific methods to views or API endpoints.
*   We are *not* analyzing general Rails authorization mechanisms (like CanCanCan or Pundit) *except* where they interact directly with Draper.
*   We are *not* analyzing vulnerabilities in the underlying models or controllers *except* as they relate to the decorator's authorization.
*   We are specifically focusing on the scenario where a sensitive method is *incorrectly* exposed due to misconfiguration.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand on it with specific examples and scenarios.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We'll construct hypothetical code examples demonstrating vulnerable configurations and their secure counterparts.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We'll analyze the impact of the vulnerability, considering different types of sensitive data and actions.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:** We'll propose concrete, actionable steps to prevent and detect this vulnerability.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:** We'll outline specific testing strategies to ensure the authorization is working as intended.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.3.1 Incorrectly Delegating Sensitive Methods

**2.1. Threat Modeling and Scenario Expansion**

The core threat is that an attacker can invoke a method on a decorated object that they should not have access to.  This can lead to:

*   **Data Breaches:**  Exposing sensitive user data (e.g., email addresses, passwords, financial information, PII).
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Allowing a regular user to perform actions reserved for administrators (e.g., deleting users, modifying system settings).
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Allowing unauthorized modification of data (e.g., changing order statuses, altering product prices).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, a misconfigured method could be exploited to cause a denial of service, although this is less likely than the other impacts.

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1:  User Profile Modification:**
    *   A `UserDecorator` has a method `update_role(new_role)` that is intended only for administrators.
    *   The decorator incorrectly includes `allows :update_role` or omits `denies :update_role`.
    *   An attacker can send a request (e.g., through a crafted form or API call) that invokes this method, changing their own role to "admin".

*   **Scenario 2:  Financial Transaction Exposure:**
    *   An `OrderDecorator` has a method `display_transaction_details` that includes sensitive payment information.
    *   This method is accidentally exposed.
    *   An attacker can view the transaction details of any order, not just their own.

*   **Scenario 3:  Hidden Data Leakage:**
    *   A `ProductDecorator` has a method `internal_notes` that contains confidential information about the product.
    *   This method is exposed.
    *   An attacker can access this sensitive information, potentially gaining a competitive advantage or finding vulnerabilities.

**2.2. Hypothetical Code Examples**

**Vulnerable Code (UserDecorator):**

```ruby
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def update_role(new_role)
    object.update(role: new_role)
  end

  # Missing 'denies :update_role' - CRITICAL VULNERABILITY
  # OR incorrectly using 'allows :update_role'
end
```

**Secure Code (UserDecorator):**

```ruby
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def update_role(new_role)
    object.update(role: new_role)
  end

  denies :update_role  # Explicitly deny access - BEST PRACTICE
end
```

**Alternative Secure Code (using `allows` - less preferred):**

```ruby
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def update_role(new_role)
    object.update(role: new_role)
  end
  def full_name
    "#{object.first_name} #{object.last_name}"
  end

  allows :full_name # Only allow access to full_name, implicitly denying others.
end
```
**Vulnerable Code (OrderDecorator):**
```ruby
class OrderDecorator < Draper::Decorator
    delegate_all
end
```
**Secure Code (OrderDecorator):**
```ruby
class OrderDecorator < Draper::Decorator
    delegate_all
    denies :payment_details
end
```

**2.3. Vulnerability Analysis**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might forget to add `denies` rules, especially when adding new methods to existing decorators.  The use of `delegate_all` without careful consideration of `allows` and `denies` increases the likelihood.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.  The impact depends on the sensitivity of the exposed method.  Exposing administrative functions or sensitive data can have severe consequences.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Exploiting this vulnerability typically requires minimal effort.  The attacker just needs to know (or guess) the name of the exposed method and send a request that invokes it.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  The attacker needs some understanding of how Rails applications and decorators work, but they don't need advanced hacking skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Without specific tests or security audits, this vulnerability can be difficult to detect.  Standard logging might not reveal the unauthorized access, especially if the method doesn't have obvious side effects.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies**

1.  **Prefer `denies` over `allows`:**  Always explicitly deny access to sensitive methods using `denies`. This is a more secure approach because it defaults to denying access unless explicitly allowed.  It's a "whitelist" approach, which is generally preferred for security.

2.  **Avoid `delegate_all` without careful consideration:** While `delegate_all` can be convenient, it makes it easier to accidentally expose methods.  If you use `delegate_all`, *always* use `denies` to explicitly block any methods that should not be accessible.  Consider explicitly delegating only the necessary methods instead.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only expose the absolute minimum functionality required through the decorator.  Don't add methods to the decorator unless they are absolutely necessary for the view or API.

4.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on the `allows` and `denies` configurations in your decorators.  Look for any potentially sensitive methods that are not explicitly denied.

5.  **Security Audits:**  Consider periodic security audits by external experts to identify potential vulnerabilities, including misconfigured decorators.

6.  **Input Validation:** While not directly related to Draper's authorization, always validate and sanitize *all* user input, even if it's coming through a decorated object.  This can help prevent other types of attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

**2.5. Testing Recommendations**

1.  **Unit Tests for `allows` and `denies`:**  Write unit tests that specifically verify the behavior of `allows` and `denies`.  These tests should:
    *   Attempt to call allowed methods and verify that they succeed.
    *   Attempt to call denied methods and verify that they raise an appropriate exception (e.g., `Draper::UnreachableMethod`).
    *   Test edge cases, such as methods that are allowed for some users but denied for others (if you have role-based access control).

    ```ruby
    # Example Unit Test (using RSpec)
    require 'rails_helper'

    RSpec.describe UserDecorator, type: :decorator do
      let(:user) { create(:user) }
      let(:admin) { create(:user, role: :admin) }
      let(:decorated_user) { user.decorate }
      let(:decorated_admin) { admin.decorate }

      describe '#update_role' do
        it 'raises an error when called by a regular user' do
          expect { decorated_user.update_role('admin') }.to raise_error(Draper::UnreachableMethod)
        end
      end
      describe '#full_name' do
        it 'returns full name' do
          expect( decorated_user.full_name).to eq("#{user.first_name} #{user.last_name}")
        end
      end
    end
    ```

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests that simulate user interactions and verify that unauthorized access is prevented.  These tests should cover scenarios where an attacker might try to exploit a misconfigured decorator.

3.  **Security-Focused Tests:**  Consider using security testing tools (e.g., Brakeman, OWASP ZAP) to automatically scan your application for potential vulnerabilities, including those related to authorization.

4. **Test with different user roles:** If your application uses roles, ensure your tests cover scenarios with different user roles to verify that the authorization rules are enforced correctly for each role.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and testing recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities related to misconfigured `allows` and `denies` in your Draper decorators.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews and updates are essential to maintain a secure application.
