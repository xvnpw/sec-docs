## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_exploit_decorator_logic_flaws__high_risk_.md)

*   **1. Exploit Decorator Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker aims to find and exploit vulnerabilities within the Ruby code of the Draper decorators. This is the root of the high-risk path related to logic errors.
    *   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it's the entry point for a major class of attacks.

*   **1.1 Input Validation Bypass in Decorator:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to bypass input validation checks *within the decorator itself*. This is crucial because even if the model has validations, the decorator might introduce new vulnerabilities if it processes user input without its own checks.
    *   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because successful exploitation often directly leads to the attacker's goal. It's the most direct and common path to compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Logic Error:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts specific, malicious input designed to cause unexpected behavior in the decorator's methods. This could involve:
        *   Injecting special characters.
        *   Providing excessively long strings.
        *   Using unexpected data types.
        *   Supplying values outside expected ranges.
        *   Exploiting type confusion vulnerabilities.
    *   **Criticality:** This is a critical sub-node as it represents the *method* of achieving the input validation bypass.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** If a decorator has a method that concatenates user-supplied strings without checking for length, an attacker could provide an extremely long string, potentially causing a denial-of-service or buffer overflow.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict input validation *within the decorator* for all data received from views or potentially influenced by user input.
        *   Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good input) instead of blacklisting (blocking known-bad input) whenever possible.
        *   Sanitize all user input before using it in any operation, especially string manipulation or database queries.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Escape output properly to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

*   **1.1.2 Leverage Unintended Decorator Helpers:**
    *   **Description:** If a decorator uses helper methods (Rails helpers or custom helpers) in an insecure way, an attacker might be able to exploit this.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Example:** If a decorator uses `raw` or `html_safe` on user-supplied data without proper sanitization, it could lead to XSS.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Carefully review the use of any helper methods within decorators.
        *   Avoid `raw` and `html_safe` unless absolutely necessary, and *always* sanitize user input before using them.
        *   Use secure-by-default helpers whenever possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Bypass Decorator Authorization/Access Control [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_bypass_decorator_authorizationaccess_control__high_risk_.md)

*   **2. Bypass Decorator Authorization/Access Control:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to circumvent the authorization mechanisms provided by Draper (e.g., `allows`, `denies`, `decorates_finders`) to gain access to data or functionality they shouldn't have.

*   **2.3 Misconfigured `allows` or `denies`:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits incorrect configurations of the `allows` and `denies` methods, which control access to decorator methods.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.3.1 Incorrectly Delegating Sensitive Methods:**
    *   **Description:** This is a specific, high-impact instance of misconfiguration. A method that *should* be protected (e.g., one that modifies data or exposes sensitive information) is accidentally exposed via `allows` or a missing `denies` rule.
    *   **Criticality:** This is a critical sub-node because it directly exposes a sensitive operation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** A decorator for a `User` model might have a method called `update_admin_status`. If this method is accidentally included in the `allows` list or not explicitly denied, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Prefer using `denies` to explicitly block access to sensitive methods. This is a more secure approach than relying on `allows` to implicitly deny access.
        *   Regularly review the `allows` and `denies` configurations in your decorators.
        *   Write tests specifically to verify that the `allows` and `denies` rules are working as expected.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege: only expose the minimum necessary functionality.
