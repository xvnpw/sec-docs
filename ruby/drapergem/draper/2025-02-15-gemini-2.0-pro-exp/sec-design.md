Okay, let's create a detailed design document for the Draper project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Draper is positioned as a foundational tool for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Tezos blockchain.  It aims to simplify the development process by providing a readily available, secure, and well-documented smart contract template.  The project's success hinges on adoption by developers, which in turn depends on its reliability, security, and ease of use.

Business Priorities:

*   Enable rapid dApp development on Tezos.
*   Provide a secure and reliable foundation for smart contracts.
*   Foster a community of developers around the project.
*   Reduce the barrier to entry for Tezos dApp development.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and documentation.

Business Goals:

*   Become a widely used and recognized template for Tezos smart contracts.
*   Attract a significant number of developers to use Draper.
*   Minimize security vulnerabilities and potential exploits in deployed contracts.
*   Ensure long-term maintainability and adaptability of the project.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Critical smart contract vulnerabilities leading to financial loss for users.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or perceived insecurity.
*   Inability to keep up with Tezos protocol updates and evolving best practices.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or poor code quality.
*   Competition from other smart contract templates or development frameworks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The project appears to be in its early stages, and the repository provides a basic smart contract template.  A comprehensive security posture assessment requires more information, but we can infer some initial aspects and make recommendations.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of LIGO, a strongly typed language for Tezos smart contracts, which helps prevent some common programming errors. (Described in the README and evident in the contract code.)
*   security control: Basic documentation including a README and some comments within the code. (Present in the repository.)
*   security control: Example tests, using `testing.mligo` (Present in the repository.)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project is under active development, and the provided contract is a template; it is the responsibility of developers using Draper to thoroughly audit and test their implementations.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying Tezos blockchain and the LIGO compiler.
*   accepted risk: Limited formal verification or external security audits have been conducted (as far as is publicly visible).

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, covering all critical contract functions and edge cases.
*   security control: Integrate static analysis tools (SAST) into the development workflow to identify potential vulnerabilities early.
*   security control: Conduct a formal security audit by a reputable third-party firm specializing in smart contract security.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and patching process.
*   security control: Provide detailed security guidelines and best practices for developers using Draper.
*   security control: Consider formal verification of critical contract logic.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The contract template itself doesn't handle user authentication in the traditional sense. Authentication on Tezos is managed at the account level via cryptographic signatures. Developers using Draper must ensure that any operations requiring authorization are properly validated using these signatures.
*   Authorization:
    *   The provided `owner` pattern in the template demonstrates a basic form of authorization.  Developers should carefully define roles and permissions within their contracts, ensuring that only authorized accounts can perform sensitive operations.  Access control should follow the principle of least privilege.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input parameters to contract entry points must be rigorously validated. This includes checking data types, ranges, and any other relevant constraints.  The LIGO language provides some type safety, but additional validation is often necessary.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The contract relies on the cryptographic primitives provided by the Tezos blockchain (e.g., for signatures and hashing). Developers should avoid implementing custom cryptographic functions and instead use the well-vetted built-in functions.  Any use of cryptographic keys must follow secure key management practices.

Current (Manual) Build Process:

1.  Developer writes LIGO code (`.mligo` files).
2.  Developer manually compiles the LIGO code using the `ligo compile contract` command.
3.  Developer manually deploys the resulting Michelson code (`.tz` file) using a wallet or `tezos-client`.

Recommended Build Process (using GitHub Actions):

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") -- Pushes code --> GitHubRepo("GitHub Repository")
    GitHubRepo -- Triggers --> GitHubActions("GitHub Actions")
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> LIGOBBuild("LIGO Build & Test")

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Deployment of secure and reliable smart contracts.
*   Integrity of the contract's state and data.
*   User funds and assets managed by the contract.
*   Reputation of the Draper project and its contributors.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Smart contract source code (LIGO): High sensitivity - vulnerabilities can lead to exploits.
*   Compiled Michelson code: High sensitivity - represents the executable logic on the blockchain.
*   Contract state data: Variable sensitivity - depends on the specific dApp and the data it manages.  Could include user balances, ownership records, or other sensitive information.
*   User private keys (not directly handled by Draper, but crucial for users interacting with dApps): Extremely high sensitivity - compromise leads to complete loss of funds.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of dApps are envisioned to be built using Draper? This will influence the specific security requirements and risk assessment.
*   What is the intended level of security assurance? (e.g., informal testing, formal verification, external audits)
*   What is the process for handling updates and bug fixes to the Draper template?
*   Are there any plans to integrate with specific Tezos development tools or frameworks?
*   What level of support and documentation will be provided to developers using Draper?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Assumes that the primary goal is to provide a secure and easy-to-use template for basic Tezos smart contracts.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Assumes that developers using Draper will have some familiarity with Tezos and smart contract security principles. Assumes reliance on the underlying security of the Tezos blockchain.
*   DESIGN: Assumes a relatively simple contract structure, as demonstrated by the provided template. Assumes deployment to the Tezos mainnet or testnets.
