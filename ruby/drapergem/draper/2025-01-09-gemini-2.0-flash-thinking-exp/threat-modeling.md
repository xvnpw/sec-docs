# Threat Model Analysis for drapergem/draper

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unintended Attribute Access](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unintended_attribute_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data by exploiting a decorator that inadvertently exposes model attributes not intended for public display. This occurs because decorators in Draper have direct access to the attributes of the decorated model. The attacker could observe this exposed data in the rendered HTML or through API responses that include decorated objects.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, potential violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Draper Component:** Decorator classes (specifically the methods within them that access model attributes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review decorator code to ensure only necessary attributes are accessed.
    *   Employ the principle of least privilege when designing decorators, limiting access to model attributes.
    *   Consider using whitelisting or blacklisting approaches to explicitly define which attributes can be accessed within decorators.
    *   Implement integration tests that specifically check for the presence of sensitive data in decorated output.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Helper Methods in Decorators](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_helper_methods_in_decorators.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application if a decorator utilizes a helper method that doesn't properly sanitize output. Since Draper decorators can call helper methods, a vulnerability in a helper can be directly exploited through the decorator's rendering process. The unsanitized output would then be rendered in the user's browser, executing the malicious script.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
*   **Affected Draper Component:** Interaction between Decorator classes and Helper methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all helper methods used by decorators properly sanitize output using appropriate escaping techniques (e.g., HTML escaping).
    *   Regularly audit and update helper methods for known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Educate developers on the importance of secure coding practices when writing and using helper methods within decorators.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Decorator Methods Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/logic_errors_in_decorator_methods_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit flaws in the logic implemented within decorator methods that handle authorization or conditional rendering. Because Draper allows embedding logic within decorators to control how data is presented, vulnerabilities in this logic can lead to unauthorized access. If a decorator incorrectly determines a user's permissions or visibility of certain elements, an attacker could gain access to features or data they are not authorized to see or interact with.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features or data, potential data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Draper Component:** Decorator classes (specifically methods implementing authorization or conditional logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep authorization logic centralized in policy objects or service layers rather than relying solely on decorators.
    *   Thoroughly test decorator methods that implement conditional logic, especially those related to authorization.
    *   Conduct code reviews to identify potential flaws in authorization logic within decorators.
    *   Avoid complex authorization logic within decorators; keep them focused on presentation.
