## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authorization Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authorization_checks__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of bypassing the application's authorization mechanisms by exploiting weaknesses within the Draper gem. Success here grants unauthorized access to protected resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Decorator Logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_decorator_logic__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target flaws in how decorators are implemented, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities that allow bypassing intended authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Method Delegation Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/method_delegation_vulnerability__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit scenarios where decorator methods directly delegate calls to the decorated object without proper authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Call Undesired Method on Decorated Object (AND Gain Access to Sensitive Data/Functionality) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/call_undesired_method_on_decorated_object__and_gain_access_to_sensitive_datafunctionality___high-ris_02e01b76.md)

The attacker successfully calls a method on the underlying object that should be restricted, gaining access to sensitive data or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inconsistent Authorization Logic in Decorator (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inconsistent_authorization_logic_in_decorator__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers identify and exploit flaws or inconsistencies in the authorization rules implemented within the decorator methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Restricted Data/Functionality Due to Logic Flaw (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_restricted_datafunctionality_due_to_logic_flaw__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The attacker leverages the identified logic flaw to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Draper Context (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_draper_context__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to influence the context object used by Draper, altering its state to bypass authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Context (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_context__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers inject malicious data into the Draper context, potentially through URL parameters, session data, or other input vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Decorator Behavior to Bypass Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/influence_decorator_behavior_to_bypass_checks__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The injected data manipulates the decorator's logic, causing it to incorrectly grant access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Override or Replace Decorators (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/override_or_replace_decorators__critical_node_.md)

Attackers attempt to replace legitimate decorators with malicious ones, gaining complete control over the decorated objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Decorator (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_decorator__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers find a way to inject their own custom decorator into the application's execution flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code or Access Sensitive Data (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_or_access_sensitive_data__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The malicious decorator is used to execute arbitrary code on the server or directly access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Decorator Initialization Flaws (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_decorator_initialization_flaws__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities during the creation and initialization of decorator instances.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Decorator Constructor (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_in_decorator_constructor__critical_node_.md)

Attackers provide malicious input to the decorator's constructor, which is not properly validated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability in Decorated Object via Decorator (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_in_decorated_object_via_decorator__critical_node_.md)

The malicious input passed to the decorator triggers a vulnerability in the underlying decorated object.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies or Interactions of Draper (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_or_interactions_of_draper__critical_node_.md)

Attackers focus on vulnerabilities arising from Draper's dependencies or its interactions with other libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerability in a Draper Dependency (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerability_in_a_draper_dependency__critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the Ruby gems that Draper depends on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerability via Draper Usage (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerability_via_draper_usage__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Draper's code utilizes a vulnerable dependency in a way that allows the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Interaction with Other Gems/Libraries (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_interaction_with_other_gemslibraries__critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities created by the interaction between Draper and other gems used in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Draper's Interaction to Exploit Other Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_draper's_interaction_to_exploit_other_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Draper's functionality is used as a stepping stone to exploit vulnerabilities in other parts of the application.
