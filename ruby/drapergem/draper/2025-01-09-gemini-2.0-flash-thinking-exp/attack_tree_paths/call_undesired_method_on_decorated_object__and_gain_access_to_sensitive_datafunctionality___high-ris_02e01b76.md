## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Call Undesired Method on Decorated Object (AND Gain Access to Sensitive Data/Functionality)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a specific attack path within an attack tree for an application utilizing the `draper` gem in Ruby on Rails. The target attack path is "Call Undesired Method on Decorated Object (AND Gain Access to Sensitive Data/Functionality)". This is marked as a HIGH-RISK PATH and a CRITICAL NODE, signifying its potential for significant damage.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path exploits a fundamental aspect of the decorator pattern, which `draper` implements. Decorators are designed to add functionality or alter the behavior of an underlying object without directly modifying its class. The intended interaction is usually through the decorator, which selectively exposes or modifies the underlying object's methods.

The attacker's goal here is to bypass the decorator's intended restrictions and directly invoke a method on the *undecorated* object. This method should ideally be inaccessible through the decorator and likely contains sensitive data or performs privileged actions.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Target Identification:** The attacker first identifies objects within the application that are being decorated using `draper`. This can be done through code inspection, error messages, or by observing application behavior.

2. **Understanding the Decorator Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how the decorator is implemented for the targeted object. This includes:
    * **Methods exposed by the decorator:** Which methods are explicitly delegated to the underlying object or implemented by the decorator itself?
    * **Methods *not* exposed by the decorator:** Which methods of the underlying object are intentionally hidden or not accessible through the decorator? These are the prime targets.
    * **Decorator implementation details:** Are there any flaws or vulnerabilities in the decorator's implementation that might allow access to the underlying object?

3. **Exploiting Access to the Underlying Object:** This is the core of the attack. The attacker attempts to gain direct access to the undecorated object instance. Several techniques can be employed:

    * **Direct Attribute Access (if exposed):**  If the decorator inadvertently exposes the underlying object as a public attribute (e.g., `@source` or a similar name), the attacker can directly access it.
    * **Reflection/Metaprogramming:** Ruby's powerful metaprogramming capabilities could be used to bypass the decorator. Techniques include:
        * `instance_variable_get` or `send` to access internal attributes holding the underlying object.
        * `method` or `public_method` to retrieve method objects of the underlying object and invoke them directly.
        * Dynamically defining methods on the decorator that delegate to the underlying object.
    * **Type Casting/Object Manipulation:** In certain scenarios, the attacker might be able to manipulate object types or perform type casting to bypass the decorator. This is less likely with `draper`'s typical usage but could be relevant in complex systems.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Decorator Logic:** If the decorator has custom logic for handling method calls, vulnerabilities in this logic could be exploited to gain access to the underlying object.
    * **Serialization/Deserialization Issues:** If decorated objects are serialized and deserialized, vulnerabilities in the serialization process could lead to the creation of an instance of the underlying object without the decorator.
    * **Bypassing Authorization Checks (if present in the decorator):** If the decorator includes authorization logic, vulnerabilities in this logic could allow the attacker to bypass the checks and access the underlying object's methods.

4. **Calling the Undesired Method:** Once the attacker has a reference to the underlying object, they can directly call the method that was intended to be restricted.

5. **Accessing Sensitive Data/Functionality:** The successful invocation of the undesired method leads to the attacker gaining access to sensitive data or performing privileged actions that should have been protected by the decorator.

**Why this is a HIGH-RISK PATH and CRITICAL NODE:**

* **Bypasses Security Intent:** The decorator pattern is often used to enforce access control and present a controlled interface to objects. This attack directly undermines this security intention.
* **Potential for Significant Damage:** Accessing sensitive data can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and reputational damage. Invoking privileged functionality can lead to unauthorized actions, system compromise, and financial loss.
* **Difficult to Detect:**  Exploitation might not leave obvious traces in standard application logs, making detection challenging.
* **Impacts Trust and Integrity:** Successful exploitation can erode trust in the application and compromise the integrity of its data and operations.

**Specific Considerations for Applications Using `draper`:**

* **Common `draper` Usage:**  `draper` typically delegates methods to the underlying object using `delegate :method_name, to: :source`. Attackers will look for methods *not* delegated.
* **`source` Attribute:** The underlying object is usually accessible through the `source` attribute of the decorator. If this attribute is publicly accessible or if there's a method to expose it, it's a direct vulnerability.
* **Custom Decorator Methods:** Developers might add custom methods to decorators that inadvertently expose the underlying object or provide a way to interact with it in unintended ways.
* **Contextual Decorators:**  If decorators rely on context (e.g., current user), vulnerabilities in how this context is managed could be exploited.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strictly Control Access to Underlying Object:**
    * **Avoid exposing the underlying object directly as a public attribute.**  Make the attribute private or protected.
    * **Do not provide methods on the decorator that directly return the underlying object.**
* **Careful Method Delegation:**
    * **Explicitly delegate only the necessary methods.**  Avoid broad delegation using `delegate :all, to: :source`.
    * **Thoroughly review the list of delegated methods.** Ensure no sensitive methods are inadvertently exposed.
* **Secure Decorator Implementation:**
    * **Avoid custom logic that might expose the underlying object.**
    * **Implement robust authorization checks within the decorator if necessary.**
* **Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Regularly review decorator implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential issues related to object access and method calls.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities at runtime.
* **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to specifically target this type of vulnerability.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly related to the decorator, proper input validation can prevent attackers from manipulating data in ways that could lead to this vulnerability.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the underlying objects only have the necessary permissions and that access is controlled through the decorator.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```ruby
# Underlying model with sensitive data
class User
  attr_reader :name, :private_key

  def initialize(name, private_key)
    @name = name
    @private_key = private_key
  end

  def sensitive_action
    puts "Performing sensitive action with private key: #{@private_key}"
  end
end

# Decorator
class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all
  decorates_association :posts

  def formatted_name
    "Mr./Ms. #{object.name}"
  end
end

# Vulnerability: Exposing the underlying object
class VulnerableUserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  attr_reader :user # Inadvertently exposes the underlying object

  def initialize(object, options = {})
    super
    @user = object
  end

  delegate_all
  decorates_association :posts

  def formatted_name
    "Mr./Ms. #{object.name}"
  end
end

# Attacker can access the underlying object and call sensitive_action
user = User.new("Alice", "super_secret_key")
decorator = VulnerableUserDecorator.new(user)

# Exploit: Accessing the underlying object through the exposed attribute
undecorated_user = decorator.user
undecorated_user.sensitive_action # Attacker gains access to sensitive functionality
```

**Conclusion:**

The "Call Undesired Method on Decorated Object" attack path represents a significant security risk in applications utilizing the `draper` gem. It highlights the importance of careful decorator implementation and a deep understanding of the underlying object model. By diligently implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of this attack vector being successfully exploited, protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of their applications. Continuous vigilance and security awareness are crucial to prevent this critical vulnerability.
