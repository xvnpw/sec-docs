## Deep Analysis: Method Delegation Vulnerability in Draper-Based Application

This analysis focuses on the "Method Delegation Vulnerability" path within an attack tree for an application utilizing the Draper gem. This path is flagged as HIGH-RISK and a CRITICAL NODE, indicating its potential for significant damage.

**Understanding the Context: Draper Gem**

Before diving into the vulnerability, it's crucial to understand the role of the Draper gem. Draper is a popular Ruby gem used primarily in Rails applications to implement the "Decorator" design pattern. Decorators encapsulate presentation logic, allowing you to keep your models clean and focused on business logic. They achieve this by wrapping an object (the "source" or "model") and providing methods that enhance or format the data for display.

**The Vulnerability: Method Delegation Without Authorization**

The core of this vulnerability lies in how Draper decorators often delegate method calls to the underlying decorated object. While this delegation is a core feature for accessing the model's data, it becomes a security risk when:

1. **Sensitive Methods Exist on the Decorated Object:** The underlying model possesses methods that perform actions or expose data that should be restricted based on user roles, permissions, or context.
2. **Decorators Directly Delegate These Sensitive Methods:** The decorator's methods directly call the corresponding methods on the decorated object without implementing any authorization checks.
3. **The Decorator is Accessible in a Context Where Authorization is Expected:** Users or other parts of the application can interact with the decorator in a way that allows them to trigger these delegated calls, bypassing intended access controls.

**Attack Scenario Breakdown:**

Let's illustrate this with a potential scenario:

* **Decorated Object (Model):** `User` model with a method `update_role(new_role)` that allows changing a user's administrative privileges. This method is intended to be called only by administrators.
* **Decorator:** `UserDecorator` used to format user information for display.
* **Vulnerable Delegation:** The `UserDecorator` might have a method like `promote_user(role)` which directly calls `object.update_role(role)` without any checks to ensure the current user has the authority to perform this action.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify the Vulnerable Delegation:** The attacker discovers that the `UserDecorator` has a method (e.g., `promote_user`) that directly delegates to a sensitive method on the `User` model (e.g., `update_role`). This could be through code review, observing API interactions, or exploiting other vulnerabilities that expose the decorator's methods.
2. **Access the Decorator in an Unintended Context:** The attacker finds a way to interact with the `UserDecorator` instance in a context where they shouldn't have the authority to trigger the delegated action. This could involve:
    * **Direct API Access:** If the application exposes an API endpoint that returns decorated user objects and allows calling methods on them (e.g., through GraphQL or a poorly designed REST API).
    * **Template Injection:** If user-controlled input can influence the rendering of templates that use the decorator, potentially allowing method calls.
    * **Exploiting Another Vulnerability:**  A separate vulnerability might allow the attacker to manipulate data or state in a way that leads to the execution of the vulnerable decorator method.
3. **Trigger the Delegated Sensitive Method:** The attacker calls the vulnerable method on the decorator (e.g., `promote_user('admin')`).
4. **Bypass Authorization:** Because the decorator directly delegates without checks, the `update_role` method on the `User` model is executed, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized administrative privileges.

**Root Causes of the Vulnerability:**

* **Lack of Awareness:** Developers might not fully understand the security implications of direct delegation in decorators.
* **Convenience Over Security:** Direct delegation is often simpler to implement than implementing proper authorization checks within the decorator.
* **Implicit Trust:** Developers might implicitly trust the context in which the decorator is used, assuming authorization is handled elsewhere.
* **Complex Delegation Chains:** In more complex applications, delegation might occur through multiple layers of decorators, making it harder to track and secure all delegation points.
* **Insufficient Security Testing:**  Security testing might not specifically target this type of vulnerability.

**Impact of the Vulnerability (Why it's HIGH-RISK and CRITICAL):**

* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionality and data by elevating their privileges.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify critical data, leading to data corruption or inconsistencies.
* **Account Takeover:** Attackers can potentially gain control of other user accounts by manipulating their roles or permissions.
* **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could gain administrative access to the entire application or underlying infrastructure.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful exploitation can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Explicit Authorization Checks in Decorators:** Implement authorization logic within the decorator methods before delegating to sensitive methods on the decorated object. This ensures that only authorized users can trigger these actions. Use authorization gems like Pundit or CanCanCan to manage permissions.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the decorated object only exposes methods that are absolutely necessary for the decorator's functionality. Avoid including sensitive methods if they are not directly required for presentation logic.
* **Careful Delegation Design:**  Avoid blindly delegating all methods. Be selective about which methods are delegated and consider creating specific decorator methods that encapsulate the necessary logic instead of direct delegation.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically looking for instances of direct delegation to sensitive methods without authorization checks.
* **Security Testing:** Include specific test cases in your security testing strategy to identify this type of vulnerability. This could involve:
    * **Penetration Testing:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify exploitable delegation points.
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential delegation vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Even within delegated methods, ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent further exploitation.
* **Consider Alternative Patterns:** If delegation becomes too complex or risky, explore alternative patterns for managing presentation logic, such as presenters or view objects that don't rely on direct delegation.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to method delegation.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Prioritize Remediation:** Given the HIGH-RISK and CRITICAL nature of this vulnerability, prioritize its remediation immediately.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Code Audit:**  Specifically review all Draper decorators for instances of method delegation, especially to methods that could be considered sensitive.
3. **Implement Explicit Authorization:**  Introduce authorization checks within decorator methods before delegating to sensitive methods.
4. **Improve Security Testing:** Add specific test cases to your security testing suite to detect this type of vulnerability.
5. **Educate the Team:** Ensure the development team understands the risks associated with direct delegation in decorators and the importance of implementing proper authorization.
6. **Adopt Secure Coding Practices:** Emphasize secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including careful design and implementation of decorators.

**Conclusion:**

The "Method Delegation Vulnerability" in a Draper-based application represents a significant security risk. By directly delegating method calls without proper authorization, decorators can inadvertently expose sensitive functionality and data to unauthorized users. Addressing this vulnerability requires a proactive approach, including thorough code reviews, implementation of explicit authorization checks, and robust security testing. By understanding the root causes and implementing effective mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly enhance the security posture of the application and protect it from potential attacks.
