# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for drapergem/draper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Model Attribute and Method Exposure in Decorators (Draper Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_model_attribute_and_method_exposure_in_decorators__draper_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Decorator Review (Draper Context):**  Specifically review Draper decorators in your application (`app/decorators/`).
    2.  **Identify Draper Exposed Data:** For each decorator, pinpoint exactly which model attributes and methods are being accessed *through Draper's `@model` instance* and exposed in decorator methods and subsequently in views.
    3.  **Necessity Assessment (Draper Usage):**  Evaluate if each attribute/method exposed via Draper is *truly necessary* for the intended presentation logic *within the decorator's scope*.
    4.  **Explicit Draper Whitelisting:**  Modify Draper decorators to *explicitly* define methods that return only the required, whitelisted data. Avoid implicit or broad access to `@model` attributes.  Focus on creating decorator methods that act as controlled gateways to model data for view presentation.
    5.  **Draper Code Review & Testing:**  After restricting Draper exposure, conduct code reviews specifically looking at decorator code to confirm only intended data is accessible *via Draper*. Test views to ensure they function correctly with the limited data exposure from decorators.
    6.  **Ongoing Draper Review:**  Establish a process to regularly review Draper decorators, especially when models change, to maintain minimal data exposure through Draper.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Draper (High Severity):** Unintentional exposure of sensitive model data through Draper decorators to the view layer, potentially accessible to unauthorized users. This is directly related to how Draper facilitates data presentation.
    *   **Over-Exposure Risk Amplified by Draper (Medium Severity):** Draper's ease of access to model data can inadvertently amplify the risk of over-exposure if not carefully managed, making it easier to unintentionally leak data through the presentation layer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Draper:** **High Impact Reduction.**  Significantly reduces the risk of data leaks *specifically through Draper decorators* by limiting the data flow from models to views via decorators to only what is explicitly needed for presentation.
    *   **Over-Exposure Risk Amplification:** **Medium Impact Reduction.**  Mitigates the amplified risk introduced by Draper's convenient data access by enforcing explicit control over what data is exposed through decorators.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented in User Decorators (Draper Focused):** In `app/decorators/user_decorator.rb`, we've started using Draper to present specific user attributes through methods like `full_name` and `formatted_address`, limiting direct `@model` access in views using Draper.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Product & Order Decorators (Draper Context):**  `app/decorators/product_decorator.rb` and `app/decorators/order_decorator.rb` still largely expose model attributes directly *through Draper*, needing review and restriction of Draper-exposed data.
    *   **Systematic Draper Decorator Review:**  A systematic review of *all Draper decorators* in `app/decorators/` is needed to ensure consistent whitelisting of data exposed via Draper across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Separation of Concerns - Presentation Logic Only in Draper Decorators](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_separation_of_concerns_-_presentation_logic_only_in_draper_decorators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Draper Role Definition:** Clearly define that Draper decorators are *exclusively* for presentation logic. Emphasize that business logic should *never* reside within Draper decorators.
    2.  **Draper Code Review Focus:**  During code reviews, specifically scrutinize Draper decorators for any logic that extends beyond presentation formatting. Look for business rules, complex conditional logic affecting application behavior, or data manipulation beyond display formatting *within Draper decorators*.
    3.  **Refactor Business Logic from Draper:** If business logic is found in Draper decorators, refactor it *out of the decorator* and into appropriate layers like models, services, or presenters. Draper decorators should then call these layers to obtain pre-processed data for presentation.
    4.  **Draper Usage Guidelines:**  Establish and document clear guidelines for Draper decorator usage, explicitly stating that they are for presentation only and business logic is prohibited.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Logic Bypass due to Draper Misuse (Medium Severity):** If security checks or validations are mistakenly placed in Draper decorators (view-focused), they could be bypassed more easily, potentially leading to unauthorized actions. This risk arises from misusing Draper's intended purpose.
    *   **Maintenance Complexity due to Draper Logic Mixing (Low Severity - Indirect Security Impact):** Mixing business logic with presentation in Draper decorators makes the application harder to maintain and understand, indirectly increasing the chance of security vulnerabilities due to developer errors related to complex Draper usage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Logic Bypass (Draper Context):** **Medium Impact Reduction.** Reduces the risk of bypassing security logic *related to Draper usage* by ensuring critical checks are in appropriate layers and not misplaced in presentation-focused Draper decorators.
    *   **Maintenance Complexity (Draper Context):** **Low Impact Reduction (Indirect).** Improves code maintainability and testability *related to Draper decorators*, indirectly reducing security risks from complex Draper code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Generally Followed in New Draper Usage:**  For new features using Draper, the team is generally aware of keeping Draper decorators presentation-focused.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Legacy Draper Decorator Refactoring:**  Older Draper decorators in `app/decorators/` might contain business logic that needs refactoring *out of Draper*. A systematic audit of Draper decorators is required.
    *   **Enforcement in Draper Code Reviews:**  Code reviews need to consistently enforce the separation of concerns principle *specifically for Draper decorators*.
    *   **Formal Draper Guidelines:**  Documenting clear guidelines on Draper decorator usage and separation of concerns in our development standards, specifically addressing Draper's role.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Draper Decorator Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_draper_decorator_performance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Draper Performance Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in views that utilize Draper decorators. Focus on slow rendering times or excessive database queries *triggered by Draper decorator logic*.
    2.  **Simplify Draper Logic:**  Review Draper decorator methods for complex computations, redundant operations, or inefficient code *within the decorator itself*. Simplify logic within Draper decorators where possible.
    3.  **Database Query Optimization (Draper Context):**  If Draper decorators trigger database queries, optimize these queries. Consider eager loading associations in controllers or models to reduce N+1 query problems *related to data accessed by Draper*. Avoid complex database operations *within Draper decorators*.
    4.  **Cache Draper Results:**  For computationally expensive Draper decorator methods or methods returning static data, implement caching. Use Rails caching to store and retrieve Draper decorator results. Cache keys should invalidate correctly when underlying data changes *relevant to the Draper decorator*.
    5.  **Judicious Draper Usage:**  Evaluate if Draper decorators are truly necessary for all presentation logic. In some cases, simpler view helpers or direct model access might be more performant and sufficient, reducing unnecessary Draper overhead.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS - Draper Performance Bottleneck (Medium Severity):** Poorly performing Draper decorators can contribute to slow page load times and increased server load, potentially leading to DoS. This is a performance issue directly related to Draper usage.
    *   **Circumvention due to Slow Draper (Low Severity - Indirect Security Impact):** If the application is slow due to Draper performance issues, users might seek insecure workarounds, indirectly increasing security risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Draper Performance):** **Medium Impact Reduction.**  Optimizing Draper decorator performance reduces the risk of performance-based DoS *specifically related to Draper usage*.
    *   **Circumvention (Draper Context):** **Low Impact Reduction (Indirect).**  Improving application performance *related to Draper* contributes to a better user experience, reducing the likelihood of users seeking insecure workarounds.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Query Optimization (General):**  We generally use eager loading, which indirectly benefits Draper performance by optimizing data access *for Draper decorators*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Draper Specific Performance Profiling:**  No systematic performance profiling specifically focused on the performance impact *of Draper decorators*.
    *   **Draper Result Caching:**  Caching of Draper decorator results is not implemented.
    *   **Draper Logic Simplification Review:**  A dedicated review of Draper decorator logic for performance optimization is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Output Encoding in Draper Decorators](./mitigation_strategies/implement_output_encoding_in_draper_decorators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Output Encoding in Draper (Crucial):**  Whenever Draper decorators render data to the view, especially data from user input, databases, or external sources, ensure proper output encoding *within the Draper decorator methods*. Use `h` helper (or `ERB::Util.html_escape`) for HTML escaping in Draper decorators to prevent XSS.
    2.  **Context-Specific Draper Encoding:**  Choose the appropriate encoding method based on the output context (HTML, URL, JavaScript, etc.) *within Draper decorators*. Use `j` helper for JavaScript escaping in `<script>` tags rendered by Draper decorators.
    3.  **XSS Testing for Draper:**  Specifically test Draper decorators that handle user-generated content or sensitive data for XSS vulnerabilities. Focus testing on output generated *through Draper decorators*.
    4.  **Draper Code Review for Encoding:**  Code reviews should always verify proper output encoding is applied in Draper decorators, especially when rendering dynamic content *via Draper*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Draper (High Severity):** If Draper decorators render user data without proper output encoding, attackers can inject scripts into the output, leading to XSS. This is a direct XSS risk related to how Draper presents data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Draper:** **High Impact Reduction.**  Proper output encoding *within Draper decorators* is a fundamental defense against XSS vulnerabilities arising from data rendered through Draper.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **General `h` Helper Awareness (Draper Context):**  Developers are generally aware of using `h` helper for HTML escaping in views and *sometimes in Draper decorators*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Draper Output Encoding Review:**  Code reviews need to be more rigorous in verifying consistent and correct output encoding in *all Draper decorators*, especially for dynamic content rendered by Draper.
    *   **Context-Specific Draper Encoding Awareness:**  Ensure developers are aware of and using context-specific encoding helpers (like `j`) *within Draper decorators* when needed.
    *   **Automated Draper XSS Testing:**  Implement automated XSS testing to regularly scan for vulnerabilities, including those related to output from *Draper decorators*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Draper (Severity Varies - Can be High):** Outdated Draper gem versions can contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Draper Vulnerabilities:** **High Impact Reduction.**  Regular Draper updates and dependency scanning significantly reduce the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities *in the Draper gem*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Bundler Audit in CI (General):**  Bundler Audit checks for vulnerable gems, including Draper, during CI builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Scheduled Draper Updates:**  No formal schedule for regular Draper gem updates beyond addressing vulnerabilities flagged by Bundler Audit.
    *   **Draper Update Testing Process:**  The testing process after Draper updates could be more formalized.
    *   **Proactive Draper Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Be more proactive in monitoring security advisories *specifically for the Draper gem*.
