Misusing URL helpers like `link_to` or `url_for` within Draper decorators to construct URLs based on user-controlled data without proper validation can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities.  Medium severity is reasonable as open redirects are often used in phishing attacks and can damage user trust, but are generally not as directly impactful as XSS or data breaches.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The strategy components (URL Helper Review, Training, Principle of Least Privilege) directly address this threat.
    *   **Impact Justification:** "Medium Impact Reduction" is a reasonable assessment. The strategy significantly reduces the risk, but doesn't eliminate it entirely as human error is always possible.

*   **XSS via Draper Helper Misuse (High Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Correctly identifies a high-severity threat.  Incorrect output escaping, even with `h`, within Draper decorators can lead to XSS.  XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, leading to account takeover, data theft, and other serious consequences. High severity is justified.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The strategy components (Output Escaping Best Practices, Training, Code Review, Principle of Least Privilege) directly target this threat.
    *   **Impact Justification:** "Medium Impact Reduction" might be slightly conservative.  While the strategy significantly reduces the risk, achieving "High Impact Reduction" would require more robust measures like Content Security Policy (CSP) and automated static analysis tools in addition to this strategy. "Medium Impact Reduction" is still a significant and positive outcome.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis

*   **Open Redirect via Draper: Medium Impact Reduction.**
    *   **Analysis:**  As discussed above, this is a reasonable assessment. The strategy focuses on prevention and detection of open redirect vulnerabilities in Draper, leading to a noticeable reduction in risk.
*   **XSS via Draper Helpers: Medium Impact Reduction.**
    *   **Analysis:**  Also a reasonable assessment. The strategy strengthens defenses against XSS in Draper, but complete elimination of XSS risk is challenging.  Further layers of security might be needed for "High Impact Reduction."

#### 4.4. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation Analysis
