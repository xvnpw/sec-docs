### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Object Injection leading to Code Execution

#### 4.1 Understanding the Attack Vector

The core of this attack lies in the ability of an attacker to influence the object being decorated by `draper`. `Draper` works by wrapping a model object with a decorator object, which then provides enhanced presentation logic. The decorator often delegates method calls to the underlying model.

The vulnerability arises when user-controlled data is used, directly or indirectly, to instantiate or influence the properties of the object that will be decorated. If an attacker can craft a malicious object and have it passed to `Draper` for decoration, the decorator's methods, when invoked, might interact with the malicious object in a way that leads to code execution.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Object Injection:**  The attacker introduces a crafted object into the application's execution flow.
* **Decorator Pattern:** `Draper` implements the decorator pattern, wrapping objects to add functionality.
* **Method Delegation:** Decorators often delegate method calls to the underlying decorated object.
* **Magic Methods (e.g., `__wakeup`, `__destruct` in PHP, similar concepts in other languages):**  These methods are automatically invoked under certain conditions (e.g., unserialization, object destruction) and can be exploited if a malicious object is injected.

#### 4.2 Draper's Role in the Attack Path

While `draper` itself is not inherently vulnerable to object injection, its functionality can be a conduit for this type of attack. The vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* `draper`, specifically:

* **How the object to be decorated is determined:** If user input influences which object is decorated, an attacker might be able to substitute a malicious object.
* **How decorator methods interact with the decorated object:** If decorator methods directly access properties or call methods on the decorated object without proper sanitization or validation, a malicious object with specially crafted properties or methods can be exploited.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to customize the appearance of data. The application might use `draper` to format this data for display. If the application allows users to provide data that is then used to instantiate the object being decorated, an attacker could inject a malicious object.

```ruby
# Hypothetical vulnerable code

class UserDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def formatted_name
    # Potentially vulnerable if user.data is attacker-controlled
    "<h1>#{object.data[:name]}</h1>"
  end
end

# ... elsewhere in the code ...

user_data = params[:user_data] # User-controlled input
user_object = User.new(data: JSON.parse(user_data)) # Potentially creating an object with attacker data
decorated_user = UserDecorator.decorate(user_object)
```

In this simplified example, if `params[:user_data]` contains malicious JSON that, when parsed, creates an object with harmful properties or methods, the `formatted_name` method could be exploited.

#### 4.3 Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Attack

1. **Attacker Crafts Malicious Payload:** The attacker creates a specially crafted object. This object might contain properties or methods designed to execute arbitrary code when accessed or invoked. The specific nature of the payload depends on the underlying language and available "magic methods" or exploitable functionalities.

2. **Injection Point:** The attacker finds a point in the application where user-controlled data can influence the object being decorated. This could be through:
    * **Direct instantiation:** User input is directly used to create the object that will be decorated.
    * **Indirect influence:** User input modifies data that is later used to create the object.
    * **Serialization/Unserialization vulnerabilities:** If the application serializes objects and allows user-controlled data to influence the serialization or deserialization process, a malicious object can be injected during unserialization.

3. **Object Decoration:** The application uses `Draper::Decorator.decorate()` to wrap the (potentially malicious) object.

4. **Invocation of Decorator Methods:**  The application calls methods on the decorator object.

5. **Interaction with Malicious Object:**  The decorator's methods interact with the underlying decorated object. This interaction can trigger the malicious payload in several ways:
    * **Accessing malicious properties:** The decorator might access a property of the malicious object that triggers code execution (e.g., through a getter method with side effects).
    * **Delegating to malicious methods:** If the decorator delegates a method call to the malicious object, the attacker's code within that method will be executed.
    * **Exploiting "magic methods":** If the malicious object has defined methods like `__wakeup` or `__destruct` (in PHP), these might be automatically invoked during the object's lifecycle, leading to code execution.

6. **Code Execution:** The malicious code within the injected object is executed within the application's context, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    * **Gain unauthorized access to data.**
    * **Modify data.**
    * **Execute system commands.**
    * **Compromise the entire application or server.**

#### 4.4 Potential Vulnerabilities in Draper-Based Applications

Several coding practices can make an application vulnerable to this attack:

* **Directly using user input to instantiate objects that will be decorated.**
* **Using user input to influence the properties of objects before decoration.**
* **Lack of input validation and sanitization on data used to create or modify objects.**
* **Unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data without proper safeguards.**
* **Decorator methods that directly access and process data from the decorated object without proper validation.**
* **Over-reliance on dynamic method delegation without considering the potential for malicious objects.**

#### 4.5 Impact Assessment

A successful object injection leading to code execution can have severe consequences:

* **Complete compromise of the application:** Attackers can gain full control over the application's functionality and data.
* **Data breaches:** Sensitive user data can be accessed, stolen, or manipulated.
* **Server compromise:** In some cases, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges and compromise the underlying server.
* **Reputational damage:** Security breaches can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.
* **Financial loss:**  Data breaches and service disruptions can lead to significant financial losses.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies

To prevent object injection leading to code execution in `draper`-based applications, the following mitigation strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before using it to create or modify objects. Use whitelisting to allow only expected input patterns.
* **Secure Object Creation:** Avoid directly using user input to instantiate objects that will be decorated. Instead, create objects based on validated and sanitized data.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.
* **Secure Deserialization Practices:** If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and techniques. Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. Implement integrity checks to ensure the data hasn't been tampered with.
* **Careful Design of Decorator Methods:** Design decorator methods to be resilient to potentially malicious objects. Avoid directly accessing and processing data from the decorated object without validation.
* **Consider using Value Objects:**  Instead of directly decorating complex model objects, consider decorating value objects that contain only the necessary data for presentation. This can limit the attack surface.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can sometimes be a precursor to object injection attacks.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter out malicious requests and potentially block object injection attempts.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep the `draper` gem and other dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

#### 4.7 Example Scenario (Conceptual)

Let's consider a simplified Ruby on Rails application using `draper` to display user profiles.

**Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    @profile_data = JSON.parse(params[:profile_settings]) # User-controlled data
    @profile = Profile.new(@user, @profile_data)
    @decorated_profile = ProfileDecorator.decorate(@profile)
  end
end

# app/decorators/profile_decorator.rb
class ProfileDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def display_custom_message
    # Potentially vulnerable if @profile.settings contains malicious code
    object.settings['custom_message'].html_safe
  end
end

# app/models/profile.rb
class Profile
  attr_reader :user, :settings

  def initialize(user, settings)
    @user = user
    @settings = settings
  end
end
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a malicious `profile_settings` JSON payload that, when parsed, creates a `Profile` object with a `settings` hash containing a malicious `custom_message`. When the `display_custom_message` method is called, the `html_safe` method could execute embedded JavaScript or other malicious code.

**Mitigation:**

* **Avoid directly parsing user input into object properties.**
* **Validate and sanitize the `profile_settings` data before creating the `Profile` object.**
* **Use a templating engine with proper escaping to prevent XSS.**

### 5. Conclusion

The "Object Injection leading to Code Execution" attack path, while not a direct vulnerability of the `draper` gem itself, is a significant risk in applications that utilize `draper` without careful consideration of how user input influences the objects being decorated. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and ensure the security of their applications. A defense-in-depth approach, combining input validation, secure object creation, and careful design of decorator methods, is crucial for preventing this type of attack.
