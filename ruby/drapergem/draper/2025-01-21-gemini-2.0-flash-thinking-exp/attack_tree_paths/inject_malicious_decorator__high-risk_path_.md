### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Decorator

#### 4.1 Attack Breakdown

The "Inject Malicious Decorator" attack path can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Identification of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies a point in the application where a decorator class or file path is dynamically loaded based on user input or external configuration. This could be:
    *   A parameter in a URL or form submission.
    *   A value read from a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON).
    *   Data retrieved from a database.
    *   An environment variable.
2. **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** The attacker creates a malicious decorator file containing code designed to compromise the application. This code could perform various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Executing arbitrary system commands.
    *   Reading or writing sensitive data.
    *   Modifying application logic.
    *   Establishing a backdoor.
3. **Injecting the Malicious Path:** The attacker manipulates the vulnerable input to point to the malicious decorator file. This could involve:
    *   Providing a relative or absolute path to a file on the server's filesystem.
    *   If the application fetches decorators from a remote location, providing a URL to the malicious file.
4. **Decorator Loading and Execution:** The application, using the Draper gem or a similar mechanism, attempts to load the decorator from the provided path.
5. **Compromise:** The malicious decorator code is executed within the application's context, leading to the desired compromise.

#### 4.2 Vulnerabilities

The core vulnerabilities enabling this attack are:

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application trusts user-provided or externally configured data to specify the location of decorator files without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Dynamic Loading of Code:** The application's architecture allows for the dynamic loading and execution of code based on external input, creating an opportunity for code injection.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  The application might lack proper access controls on the filesystem or remote locations where decorators are loaded from, allowing attackers to place or reference malicious files.

#### 4.3 Prerequisites

For this attack to be successful, the following prerequisites are necessary:

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The application must implement a mechanism for dynamically loading decorators based on external input.
*   **Attacker Knowledge:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input point and understand how the application loads decorators.
*   **Write Access (Potentially):** In some scenarios, the attacker might need write access to the server's filesystem to place the malicious decorator file. However, if the application fetches decorators from external sources, this might not be required.

#### 4.4 Potential Impact

A successful "Inject Malicious Decorator" attack can have severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the application's database or filesystem.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete critical application data, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious decorator could be designed to crash the application or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the application handles user authentication, the attacker could potentially gain access to user accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker could leverage this to gain higher-level access to the system.

#### 4.5 Draper Gem Integration

The Draper gem facilitates the creation and application of decorators to objects. While Draper itself doesn't inherently introduce this vulnerability, the way an application *uses* Draper can create the attack surface. Specifically, if the application uses user input or external configuration to determine *which* decorator to apply, it becomes susceptible.

For example, consider a scenario where the application allows users to select a "theme" which then loads a corresponding decorator:

```ruby
# Potentially vulnerable code
class ProductController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    theme = params[:theme] # User-provided input

    # Vulnerable: Directly using user input to determine decorator class
    decorator_class_name = "#{theme.camelize}ProductDecorator"
    if Object.const_defined?(decorator_class_name)
      decorator_class = decorator_class_name.constantize
      @decorated_product = decorator_class.decorate(@product)
    else
      @decorated_product = ProductDecorator.decorate(@product)
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, an attacker could provide a malicious value for the `theme` parameter, pointing to a file containing malicious code that is then loaded and executed when `constantize` is called.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the "Inject Malicious Decorator" attack, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user input or external configuration that influences the loading of decorators. Implement a whitelist of allowed decorator names or paths. Avoid directly using user-provided strings to construct class names or file paths.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage if a malicious decorator is executed.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Store configuration data securely and restrict access to configuration files. Avoid storing sensitive information in easily accessible configuration files.
*   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities related to dynamic code loading and input handling. Pay close attention to areas where user input or external configuration is used to determine which code to execute.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities, including those related to code injection.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to test the running application for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks, including attempts to inject malicious decorators.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the application can load resources, potentially mitigating attacks where malicious decorators are loaded from external sources.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application.
*   **Consider Alternative Approaches:** Evaluate if the dynamic loading of decorators based on external input is truly necessary. Explore alternative architectural patterns that might be less susceptible to this type of attack. For instance, using a predefined set of decorators and selecting them based on a controlled mapping.

#### 4.7 Example Scenario

Consider an application that allows users to customize the appearance of certain elements by selecting a "theme." The application dynamically loads a decorator based on the selected theme:

1. The application has a route like `/products/123?theme=default`.
2. The `ProductController` uses the `theme` parameter to determine which decorator to load.
3. An attacker crafts a request like `/products/123?theme=../../../../tmp/malicious_decorator`.
4. The attacker has previously uploaded a file named `malicious_decorator.rb` containing malicious code to the `/tmp` directory (or another accessible location).
5. The application attempts to load the decorator from the path `../../../../tmp/malicious_decorator`.
6. The malicious code within `malicious_decorator.rb` is executed, potentially compromising the application.

**Example `malicious_decorator.rb`:**

```ruby
class MaliciousDecorator < Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def initialize(object, options = {})
    super
    system("whoami > /tmp/attacker_knows_user") # Example malicious action
  end
end
```

This example demonstrates how an attacker can leverage path traversal to inject a malicious decorator.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Inject Malicious Decorator" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications that dynamically load decorators based on external input. By understanding the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. Prioritizing input validation, secure configuration management, and thorough code reviews are crucial steps in securing applications utilizing the Draper gem or similar dynamic code loading mechanisms.
