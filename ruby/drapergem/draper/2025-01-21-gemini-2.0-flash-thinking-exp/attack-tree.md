## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Draper (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_draper__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Draper vulnerabilities leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Decorator Logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_decorator_logic__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the code within decorator methods to achieve malicious outcomes. This involves identifying and exploiting flaws in how decorators process data or interact with the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Method Calls within Decorator (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_method_calls_within_decorator__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting malicious code into a decorator method that is then executed by the application. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in dynamic code execution or insufficient input sanitization within the decorator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  Manipulating a decorator method to make unintended requests to internal or external resources. This occurs when the decorator uses user-controlled data to construct URLs or other request parameters without proper validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Control Bypass within Decorator (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_control_bypass_within_decorator__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in the authorization logic within a decorator method. This allows attackers to access data or functionality they should not have access to, even if application-level access controls are in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Use of Helpers within Decorator (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_use_of_helpers_within_decorator__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Helper Methods (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_helper_methods__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  Leveraging vulnerabilities present in helper methods that are called by decorators. This could include common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection if the helper interacts with the database, or other injection flaws depending on the helper's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Decorator Context (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_decorator_context__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Object Injection leading to Code Execution (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/object_injection_leading_to_code_execution__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  If the application allows user-controlled data to influence the object being decorated, an attacker might be able to inject a malicious object. When decorator methods are called on this malicious object, it can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Draper's Rendering Process (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_draper's_rendering_process__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Decorator Output (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_decorator_output__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  Injecting malicious scripts into the output generated by decorator methods. This occurs when decorators output user-controlled data without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing the injected script to execute in the victim's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Draper's Initialization or Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_draper's_initialization_or_configuration__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Decorator (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_decorator__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  If the application dynamically loads decorators based on user input or external configuration, an attacker might be able to provide a path to a malicious decorator file. When this malicious decorator is loaded and used, it can compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Override Existing Decorators (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/override_existing_decorators__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  Exploiting flaws in the application's decorator loading mechanism to replace legitimate decorators with malicious ones. This allows the attacker to control the behavior of the application when those decorators are invoked.
