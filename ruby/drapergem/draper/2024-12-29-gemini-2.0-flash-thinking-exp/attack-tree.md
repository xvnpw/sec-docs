# Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes for Application Using Draper Gem

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality of the application by leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application uses the Draper gem.

## Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

### 1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Decorator Methods:

* **Critical Node: Identify a decorator method that renders user-controlled data as a template:**
    * **Description:** The attacker identifies a decorator method where user-provided data is directly used in a template rendering process without proper sanitization.
    * **Mechanism:** This involves analyzing the application's code, particularly the decorator methods and their rendering logic, to find instances where user input flows directly into template rendering functions.
    * **Likelihood:** Low - Requires specific coding mistakes and direct rendering of user input.
    * **Impact:** High - If successful, this opens the door for complete server compromise.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of the application's code and template engine.
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced - Requires knowledge of template injection techniques.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring for unusual template rendering activity or specific injection payloads.

* **Critical Node: Inject malicious template code into the user-controlled data:**
    * **Description:** Once a vulnerable decorator method is identified, the attacker crafts malicious template code (e.g., using the syntax of the application's template engine) and injects it into the user-controlled data that feeds into the vulnerable method.
    * **Mechanism:** This involves crafting payloads specific to the template engine in use (e.g., ERB, Haml, Liquid) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Likelihood:** High - If the previous step is successful, exploitation is straightforward.
    * **Impact:** High - Leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS).
    * **Effort:** Low - Readily available SSTI payloads and techniques.
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Understanding of basic SSTI syntax and template engines.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Signatures for common SSTI payloads can be used by security tools.

### 2. HTML Injection via Decorator Output:

* **Critical Node: Identify a decorator method that returns unsanitized HTML:**
    * **Description:** The attacker identifies a decorator method that generates HTML output containing user-provided data without proper HTML escaping or sanitization.
    * **Mechanism:** This involves code review or dynamic analysis to find decorator methods that directly embed user input into the HTML they return.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Common mistake, especially when dealing with user-generated content.
    * **Impact:** Medium - Leads to Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires basic code inspection.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner - Understanding of HTML and basic web concepts.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** High - Can be difficult to detect without thorough code review or dynamic analysis.

* **Critical Node: Inject malicious HTML (e.g., `<script>`) into data processed by the decorator:**
    * **Description:** Once a vulnerable decorator method is found, the attacker injects malicious HTML code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into the user-controlled data that is processed by the decorator.
    * **Mechanism:** This involves providing input containing HTML tags and JavaScript code that will be rendered directly in the user's browser.
    * **Likelihood:** High - If the previous step is successful, exploitation is simple.
    * **Impact:** Medium - Leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Session Hijacking, Defacement.
    * **Effort:** Low - Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Web application firewalls (WAFs) can detect common XSS patterns.

**Key Mitigation Strategies for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data before it is used in any rendering process or within decorator logic.
* **Mandatory Output Escaping:** Always use appropriate HTML escaping mechanisms (e.g., the `h` helper in Rails) when rendering data in views, especially data that originates from users.
* **Secure Templating Practices:** Avoid directly rendering user input as templates. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions within decorators to prevent SQL injection if applicable.
* **Regular Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on decorator methods and their handling of user input and output.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools to identify potential SSTI and XSS vulnerabilities by simulating attacks against the running application.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common XSS and SSTI attack patterns.
