# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional Loading via Gemfile](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_loading_via_gemfile.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Conditional Loading via Gemfile

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Open the project's `Gemfile`.
        2.  Locate the `better_errors` and `binding_of_caller` gem declarations.
        3.  Ensure these gems are *only* included within a `group :development do ... end` block.  If they are outside this block, move them inside.
        4.  Run `bundle install` to update the project's dependencies.
        5.  Verify that running `bundle show better_errors` in a production environment (e.g., by setting `RAILS_ENV=production`) results in an error, indicating the gem is not installed.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Accidental Deployment of `better_errors` to Production.
            *   **Severity:** Critical.  Exposes full application source code, environment variables, and allows arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Threat:** Unintentional Exposure in Staging/Testing Environments.
            *   **Severity:** High.  Similar risks to production, though potentially with a smaller attack surface.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Accidental Deployment:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (assuming proper deployment procedures).  The gem is simply not present in the production environment.
        *   **Unintentional Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly, as the gem is only available in the development environment.  Further mitigation (IP whitelisting) is still recommended for staging.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes.  `Gemfile` correctly uses the `:development` group.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** None. This is a fundamental and correctly implemented step.

## Mitigation Strategy: [IP Address Whitelisting (Staging/Testing Only)](./mitigation_strategies/ip_address_whitelisting__stagingtesting_only_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** IP Address Whitelisting (Staging/Testing Only)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Identify the IP addresses or CIDR blocks of authorized developers/testers who need access to `better_errors` in staging.
        2.  Create or modify the configuration file for the staging environment (e.g., `config/environments/staging.rb`).
        3.  Add the following line, replacing the example IPs with your authorized IPs/CIDR blocks:
            ```ruby
            BetterErrors.allowed_ip_addresses = ['192.168.1.100', '10.0.0.5', '192.168.2.0/24']
            ```
        4.  Restart the application server in the staging environment.
        5.  Test access from both allowed and disallowed IP addresses to confirm the restriction is working.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Debugger in Staging.
            *   **Severity:** High.  Attackers could gain access to sensitive information and potentially execute code.
        *   **Threat:** Exploitation via Compromised Internal Machine.
            *   **Severity:** Medium.  If an attacker compromises a machine *within* the allowed IP range, they could still access the debugger.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.  Only requests originating from the whitelisted IPs can access the debugger.
        *   **Compromised Internal Machine:** Risk remains, but the attack surface is limited to the whitelisted IPs.  Further mitigation (disabling REPL) is recommended.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  `config/environments/staging.rb` includes an `allowed_ip_addresses` setting, but it currently allows all IPs (`0.0.0.0/0`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:** The `allowed_ip_addresses` setting in `config/environments/staging.rb` needs to be updated with the correct, restrictive IP addresses/CIDR blocks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Variable Control](./mitigation_strategies/environment_variable_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Environment Variable Control

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Modify the development environment configuration file (e.g., `config/environments/development.rb`).
        2.  Wrap the `better_errors` configuration within a conditional block that checks for an environment variable:
            ```ruby
            if ENV['ENABLE_BETTER_ERRORS'] == 'true'
              # BetterErrors configuration here (e.g., maximum_variable_inspect_size)
            end
            ```
        3.  Developers must explicitly set the `ENABLE_BETTER_ERRORS` environment variable to `true` (e.g., in their shell or `.env` file) to enable `better_errors`.
        4.  Test by running the application with and without the environment variable set, verifying that `better_errors` is only active when the variable is `true`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Accidental Activation in Development.
            *   **Severity:** Medium.  Reduces the chance of developers inadvertently leaving `better_errors` active when not actively debugging.
        *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Local Access.
            *   **Severity:** Low. If someone gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine, they would still need to know to set the environment variable.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Accidental Activation:** Risk reduced.  `better_errors` is only active when explicitly enabled.
        *   **Unauthorized Local Access:** Provides a small additional layer of security, but is not a primary defense.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No.  `better_errors` is always active in the development environment.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  The conditional block based on `ENV['ENABLE_BETTER_ERRORS']` needs to be added to `config/environments/development.rb`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Variable Inspection Size and Frame Depth](./mitigation_strategies/limit_variable_inspection_size_and_frame_depth.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Variable Inspection Size and Frame Depth

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Locate the `better_errors` configuration (likely in `config/environments/development.rb` or a dedicated initializer).
        2.  Add or modify the following settings:
            ```ruby
            BetterErrors.maximum_variable_inspect_size = 100000  # Example: 100KB
            BetterErrors.maximum_frames_to_inspect = 10       # Example: 10 frames
            ```
            Adjust the values as appropriate for your application, balancing debugging needs with security.
        3.  Restart the application server.
        4.  Test by triggering an error and inspecting variables/stack frames to ensure the limits are enforced.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Large Variables).
            *   **Severity:** Medium.  Limits the amount of data exposed if an attacker gains access to the debugger.
        *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Deep Stack Traces).
            *   **Severity:** Medium.  Reduces the amount of code execution context revealed.
        *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion).
            *   **Severity:** Low.  Large variable inspection or deep stack traces could potentially consume excessive resources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced by limiting the data exposed.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced by limiting resource consumption.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `BetterErrors.maximum_frames_to_inspect` is set to 15. `BetterErrors.maximum_variable_inspect_size` is not set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** `BetterErrors.maximum_variable_inspect_size` needs to be set in the configuration. `BetterErrors.maximum_frames_to_inspect` should be reviewed and potentially lowered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable REPL in Sensitive Environments (Staging)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_repl_in_sensitive_environments__staging_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable REPL in Sensitive Environments (Staging)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Open the staging environment configuration file (e.g., `config/environments/staging.rb`).
        2.  Add the following lines:
            ```ruby
            BetterErrors.allow_remote_requests = false
            BetterErrors::Middleware.allow_ip! '127.0.0.1'
            BetterErrors::Middleware.allow_ip! '::1'
            ```
        3.  Restart the application server in the staging environment.
        4.  Attempt to access the REPL functionality (if previously accessible) to confirm it is disabled.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via REPL.
            *   **Severity:** Critical.  Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary code on the server, even if they bypass IP whitelisting.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk eliminated.  The REPL is completely disabled.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No. The REPL is potentially accessible in staging (depending on IP whitelisting).

    *   **Missing Implementation:** The lines to disable `allow_remote_requests` and restrict to localhost need to be added to `config/environments/staging.rb`.
