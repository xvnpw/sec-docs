# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Mitigation Strategy: [Production Disablement](./mitigation_strategies/production_disablement.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Open your `Gemfile`.**
    2.  **Locate the `better_errors` gem declaration.**
    3.  **Ensure it is nested within the `development` group.**  It should look like this:

        ```ruby
        group :development do
          gem 'better_errors'
          gem 'binding_of_caller' # Required by better_errors
        end
        ```
    4.  **Verify that `better_errors` is *not* declared outside of the `development` group or in the `production` group.**
    5.  **Run `bundle install`** to update your gem dependencies based on the `Gemfile` changes.
    6.  **Deploy your application to production.** The `better_errors` gem will not be included in the production bundle.
    7.  **Test in production (after deployment) by intentionally triggering an error.** You should see the standard Rails error page (e.g., "We're sorry, but something went wrong.") and *not* the `better_errors` page.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):**  Exposure of source code, environment variables, database credentials, session data, request parameters, internal paths, and database queries to unauthorized users via `better_errors` pages in production.
    *   **Attack Surface Increase (Medium Severity):**  Providing detailed error information through `better_errors` can aid attackers in understanding the application's internal workings, making it easier to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  **High Risk Reduction.**  Completely eliminates the risk of `better_errors` directly disclosing sensitive information in production environments.
    *   **Attack Surface Increase:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Significantly reduces the information available to attackers through error pages generated by `better_errors` in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes.** Implemented in the project's `Gemfile`. `better_errors` is within the `development` group.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **None.** This core mitigation is currently in place.  However, continuous verification during deployments and gem updates is crucial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment-Specific Gem Loading Verification](./mitigation_strategies/environment-specific_gem_loading_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Open your `config/environments/production.rb` file.**
    2.  **Search for any lines that might explicitly require or load `better_errors`.**  Look for code like `require 'better_errors'` or any configuration blocks that might initialize or enable `better_errors`.
    3.  **Ensure there are no such lines.**  The `production.rb` file should be completely devoid of any `better_errors` related code.
    4.  **Repeat steps 1-3 for other environment files** (`config/environments/staging.rb`, etc.) to ensure `better_errors` is only enabled in `development.rb` and potentially `test.rb`.
    5.  **Review your application's initialization process** (`config/application.rb` or initializers in `config/initializers/`) for any global or environment-agnostic loading of `better_errors`.  Ensure it's conditionally loaded based on `Rails.env.development?` or `Rails.env.test?`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Production Enablement (High Severity):**  Prevents accidental activation of `better_errors` in production due to configuration errors or misconfigurations in environment files, leading to information disclosure and attack surface increase via `better_errors`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Production Enablement:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Significantly reduces the risk of accidental production enablement of `better_errors` by ensuring environment configurations are correct.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes.** Verified that `config/environments/production.rb` and `config/environments/staging.rb` do not contain any `better_errors` related code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Ongoing Verification in CI/CD Pipeline:**  Automate checks within the CI/CD pipeline to verify that `better_errors` is not loaded in production builds. This could involve running a script that inspects the bundled gems or application configuration after deployment to a staging environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Filtering in Development/Test](./mitigation_strategies/data_filtering_in_developmenttest.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create an initializer file** (e.g., `config/initializers/better_errors.rb`) if one doesn't exist for `better_errors` configuration.
    2.  **Within the initializer, configure `better_errors` filters.**  Use `BetterErrors.configure do |config| ... end` block.
    3.  **Implement filters for sensitive environment variables.**  Use `config.blacklist_env_vars = [...]` to specify environment variables to redact from error pages generated by `better_errors`. Example:

        ```ruby
        if defined?(BetterErrors)
          BetterErrors.configure do |config|
            config.blacklist_env_vars += ['DATABASE_PASSWORD', 'API_SECRET_KEY', 'STRIPE_SECRET']
          end
        end
        ```
    4.  **Consider filtering request parameters.**  While `better_errors` might not have direct parameter filtering, you can potentially use Rack middleware or Rails parameter filtering to sanitize request data *before* it reaches `better_errors`. (This might require custom middleware to preprocess data before `better_errors` handles the exception).
    5.  **Test the filtering in your development environment.**  Trigger errors that would normally display the filtered data and verify that it is redacted in the `better_errors` error page.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Development/Test Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data (like secrets in environment variables) through `better_errors` error pages to developers or testers who have access to development/test environments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Development/Test Information Disclosure:** **Medium Risk Reduction.**  Significantly reduces the risk of accidental leakage of sensitive data within development and test environments through error pages generated by `better_errors`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented.**  Basic environment variable filtering is implemented in `config/initializers/better_errors.rb` for common secret keys.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Environment Variable Filtering:** Expand the list of `blacklist_env_vars` to include all environment variables that might contain sensitive information specific to the application and could be exposed by `better_errors`.
    *   **Request Parameter Filtering:** Investigate and implement request parameter filtering (potentially via custom middleware) to sanitize sensitive data in requests before error pages are generated by `better_errors`.
    *   **Session Data Filtering:** Explore if `better_errors` or Rack middleware can be used to filter sensitive session data from error pages generated by `better_errors`.
