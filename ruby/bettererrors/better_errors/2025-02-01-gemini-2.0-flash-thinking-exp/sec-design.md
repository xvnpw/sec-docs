# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Improve developer productivity by providing enhanced error reporting and debugging capabilities for Ruby on Rails applications.
  - Reduce debugging time and effort for developers, leading to faster development cycles.
  - Enhance the developer experience by making error messages more informative and actionable.
- Business Risks:
  - Accidental exposure of sensitive application data or internal system details if the gem is enabled in production environments. This could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.
  - Potential performance overhead if the gem's error handling mechanisms are not optimized, although this is less of a concern in development environments where it is intended to be used.
  - Dependency on an external open-source gem, which introduces a supply chain risk if the gem itself becomes compromised or is not actively maintained.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: As a development tool, better_errors gem itself does not implement specific security controls. Security is primarily the responsibility of the consuming Ruby on Rails application and its deployment environment.
  - security control: Ruby on Rails applications typically implement security controls such as authentication, authorization, input validation, and protection of sensitive data. These controls are expected to be in place in the applications that utilize better_errors.
  - security control: Development environments are generally considered less secure than production environments, with relaxed security controls to facilitate development and debugging.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Risk of information disclosure in development and staging environments is generally accepted to some extent to aid in debugging. However, care must be taken to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive production data in these environments.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on an external gem is an accepted risk inherent in using open-source libraries. This risk is mitigated by using reputable sources like RubyGems.org and regularly updating dependencies.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Ensure that better_errors gem is strictly disabled in production environments. This should be enforced through environment variable checks or configuration settings within the Ruby on Rails application.
  - security control: Implement robust environment detection logic within the application to automatically disable better_errors in production, regardless of configuration settings.
  - security control: Regularly review and update the better_errors gem to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and potential security patches.
  - security control: Educate developers on the security implications of using debugging tools in different environments and emphasize the importance of disabling better_errors in production.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to better_errors gem itself. Authentication is handled by the Ruby on Rails application.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to better_errors gem itself. Authorization is handled by the Ruby on Rails application.
  - Input Validation: While better_errors primarily displays error information, it should handle potentially malformed or malicious input gracefully without causing crashes or further vulnerabilities. Input validation is more relevant to the Ruby on Rails application itself.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable to better_errors gem itself. Cryptography is handled by the Ruby on Rails application for securing sensitive data in transit and at rest.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software development and debugging process for Ruby on Rails applications. Ensuring developer productivity and efficiency.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Potentially sensitive application data (e.g., database credentials, API keys, user data) could be exposed in error pages if better_errors is incorrectly enabled in production environments. The sensitivity level depends on the specific application and the data it handles. In general, exposure of any internal application details in production is considered a security risk.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific configuration options within better_errors that could increase the risk of information disclosure if misconfigured, even in development environments?
  - What is the process for reporting and patching security vulnerabilities in better_errors gem?
  - Are there any known compatibility issues with specific versions of Ruby or Ruby on Rails that could introduce unexpected behavior or security risks?
- Assumptions:
  - It is assumed that better_errors gem is intended and designed for use primarily in development and staging environments, and should be strictly disabled in production.
  - It is assumed that developers using better_errors are aware of the potential security implications of exposing detailed error information and will take necessary precautions to prevent accidental exposure in production.
  - It is assumed that the Ruby on Rails applications using better_errors implement their own security controls for authentication, authorization, and data protection, and that better_errors is used as a supplementary tool for development and debugging without replacing or weakening these application-level security measures.
