# Attack Surface Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure - Environment Variables and Configuration](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_-_environment_variables_and_configuration.md)

**Description:** Exposure of environment variables and application configuration settings.

**Better Errors Contribution:** `better_errors` can display environment variables accessible to the application process, potentially revealing sensitive configuration details.

**Example:**  Environment variables containing database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings), API keys for external services, or internal service URLs are displayed in the `better_errors` error page.

**Impact:**  Exposure of credentials can lead to unauthorized access to databases, external services, and internal systems. API key leaks can result in financial loss or service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable in Production:**  Absolutely disable `better_errors` in production.
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Use secure methods for managing credentials, such as Rails Encrypted Credentials, environment variable stores with restricted access, or dedicated secret management systems.
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to environments where `better_errors` might be active.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure - Variable Inspection](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_-_variable_inspection.md)

**Description:** Ability to inspect the values of application variables at the point of error.

**Better Errors Contribution:** `better_errors` provides an interactive console and variable inspection features, allowing users to explore the application's state and data in memory.

**Example:**  Inspecting a variable during an error reveals sensitive user data loaded from the database, API tokens stored in memory, or internal application state that should not be publicly accessible.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data stored in variables can lead to privacy breaches, unauthorized access to resources, and a deeper understanding of the application's internal workings for attackers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable in Production:** Disable `better_errors` in production.
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to environments where `better_errors` is active.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Access):**  Minimize the amount of sensitive data loaded into memory unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Interactive Console](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__-_interactive_console.md)

**Description:** Ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.

**Better Errors Contribution:** `better_errors` provides an interactive Ruby console directly within the error page. This console runs within the application's context and has access to application resources and the underlying server environment.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a `better_errors` page and uses the interactive console to execute commands to read sensitive files on the server, modify database records, or even execute system commands to gain shell access.

**Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement to other systems within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable in Production (MANDATORY):** **Absolutely and unequivocally disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
*   **Environment Group Configuration:**  Use Rails environment groups in your `Gemfile` to ensure `better_errors` is ONLY included in the `development` group.
*   **Strict Access Control:** Implement very strict access controls for any non-production environments where `better_errors` might be enabled.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit your application's Gemfile and environment configurations.
*   **Remove Gem in Production (Extreme Precaution):** Consider completely removing the `better_errors` gem from your production deployment process.
