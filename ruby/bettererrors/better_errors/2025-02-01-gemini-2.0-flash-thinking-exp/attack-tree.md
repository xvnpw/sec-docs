## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Better Errors (Critical Node - Root Goal):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_better_errors__critical_node_-_root_goal_.md)

This is the attacker's ultimate objective. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Exposed Better Errors in Non-Development Environment (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_exposed_better_errors_in_non-development_environment__critical_node_.md)

This is the primary attack vector. It relies on the fundamental misconfiguration of having `better_errors` active and accessible in an environment where it should not be (e.g., production, staging).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. 1.1. Direct Code Execution via Interactive Console (REPL) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__1_1__direct_code_execution_via_interactive_console__repl___high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents the most direct and impactful attack. If successful, it grants the attacker immediate code execution capabilities on the server.

*   **3.1. 1.1.1. Access REPL via Default Routes (Critical Node):**
    *   Attack Vector:  `better_errors` by default exposes routes (like `/__better_errors`) that, if not explicitly disabled or protected, are directly accessible via a web browser.
    *   Impact:  Provides immediate access to the interactive Ruby console (REPL).
    *   Mitigation:  Ensure `better_errors` is disabled in non-development environments. Verify configuration and deployment processes.

    *   **3.1.1. 1.1.1.1. Application deployed with Better Errors enabled and default routes accessible (Critical Node - Root Cause):**
        *   Attack Vector:  Developers fail to properly configure the application for non-development environments, leaving `better_errors` active and its default routes exposed.
        *   Impact:  This is the root cause that enables the entire high-risk path of direct code execution.
        *   Mitigation:  Use environment-specific gem groups in Bundler, environment variables, or configuration files to strictly disable `better_errors` outside of development and testing.

    *   **3.2. 1.1.3. Execute Arbitrary Code in REPL (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
        *   Attack Vector: Once the REPL is accessible (via path 1.1.1), the attacker can type and execute arbitrary Ruby code directly in the web browser.
        *   Impact:  Full system compromise. Attackers can execute system commands, read/write files, access databases, manipulate application state, install backdoors, and completely take over the server.
        *   Mitigation:  Prevent access to the REPL by disabling `better_errors` in non-development environments.

        *   **3.2.1. 1.1.3.1. Utilize REPL to execute system commands, access files, or manipulate application state (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
            *   Attack Vector:  Specific actions taken within the REPL to achieve malicious goals, such as using `system()` calls, file I/O operations, or interacting with application objects.
            *   Impact:  Realization of the critical impact â€“ system compromise, data breach, service disruption, etc.
            *   Mitigation:  Prevent access to the REPL (primary mitigation). Implement strong system-level security measures to limit the impact of code execution even if it occurs (defense in depth).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. 1.2. Information Disclosure via Error Pages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__1_2__information_disclosure_via_error_pages__high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents a significant risk of exposing sensitive information through detailed error pages generated by `better_errors`.

    *   **4.1. 1.2.1. Expose Sensitive Configuration Details (Critical Node):**
        *   Attack Vector: `better_errors` error pages display extensive debugging information, including stack traces, environment variables, and local variables at the point of error. This can inadvertently reveal sensitive configuration details.
        *   Impact:  Exposure of database credentials, API keys, internal paths, and other sensitive configuration data. This information can be directly used to compromise other systems or gain deeper access to the application.
        *   Mitigation:  Disable `better_errors` in non-development environments. Implement robust error handling in production to prevent detailed error pages from being displayed. Sanitize error logs and responses to remove sensitive information.

        *   **4.1.1. 1.2.1.1. Error pages reveal database credentials, API keys, or internal paths in stack traces or environment variables (Critical Node - Critical Information Leak):**
            *   Attack Vector:  Specific types of sensitive information leaked through error pages, including database connection strings, API keys for external services, and internal file system paths.
            *   Impact:  Direct compromise of databases or external services via leaked credentials. Exposure of internal paths can aid in further reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
            *   Mitigation:  Prevent information leakage by disabling `better_errors` and implementing secure error handling.  Review environment variable usage and ensure sensitive credentials are not inadvertently exposed in error contexts.
