# Threat Model Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Threat: [Source Code Exposure](./threats/source_code_exposure.md)

**Description:**  By triggering an error in a production environment where `better_errors` is enabled, an attacker can directly view the application's source code through the error page. This is a direct consequence of `better_errors`'s code display feature.

**Impact:** High. Exposing source code allows attackers to understand application logic, identify vulnerabilities, and plan targeted attacks.

**Affected Component:** Error Page Rendering (code snippet display).

**Risk Severity:** High (in production if enabled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
*   Implement automated checks in deployment pipelines to ensure `better_errors` is disabled in production.
*   Regularly audit production configurations.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Exposure](./threats/environment_variable_exposure.md)

**Description:** If `better_errors` is active in production, it will display environment variables on error pages. An attacker triggering an error can directly access sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and secrets, which are often stored in environment variables. This is a direct function of `better_errors`'s environment variable display.

**Impact:** Critical. Exposure of credentials grants attackers immediate unauthorized access to critical systems, databases, and external services, leading to severe data breaches and system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Error Page Rendering (environment variable display).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (in production if enabled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
*   Employ secure secret management practices and avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables where possible.
*   If environment variables are used for secrets, ensure they are never exposed in production logs or error pages by disabling `better_errors`.

## Threat: [Request Parameter and Session Data Exposure](./threats/request_parameter_and_session_data_exposure.md)

**Description:**  With `better_errors` enabled in production, error pages will display request parameters and session data. An attacker can trigger errors and directly view potentially sensitive user data, session tokens, and authentication cookies. This is a direct feature of `better_errors`'s request and session data display.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of user data and session information can lead to privacy violations, session hijacking, account takeover, and unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Affected Component:** Error Page Rendering (request parameter and session data display).

**Risk Severity:** High (in production if enabled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
*   Follow secure coding practices to avoid logging or displaying sensitive data unnecessarily, even in development.
*   While less effective than disabling in production, consider parameter filtering within `better_errors` configuration for development environments to limit accidental exposure during development.
