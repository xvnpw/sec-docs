## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution *** (High-Risk Path) ***](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution___high-risk_path_.md)

* Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
* This path represents the most severe form of compromise, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interactive Console [!] (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interactive_console__!___critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Leveraging the interactive console provided by `better_errors` on error pages.
* This is a critical node because it provides a direct mechanism for executing arbitrary Ruby code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Interactive Console [!] (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/access_interactive_console__!___critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Gaining access to the error page where the interactive console is displayed.
* This is a critical node because it's a prerequisite for exploiting the interactive console.
    * **Application Running in Development/Staging with Public Access *** (High-Risk Path Entry) ***:**
        * Attack Vector: The application, with `better_errors` enabled, is accessible on a public network without proper authentication.
        * This is the most direct way for an attacker to reach the interactive console.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code [!] (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code__!___critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Using the interactive console to run malicious Ruby code.
* This is a critical node because it's the point where the attacker transitions from accessing the console to actively compromising the system.
    * **Inject Malicious Ruby Code *** (High-Risk Path) ***:**
        * Attack Vector:  Inputting Ruby code into the interactive console that performs malicious actions.
        * This step directly leads to actions like database manipulation, file system access, and system command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Sensitive Information Disclosure:](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_sensitive_information_disclosure.md)

* Attacker's Goal: To gain access to confidential information managed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [View Environment Variables *** (High-Risk Path) ***](./attack_tree_paths/view_environment_variables___high-risk_path_.md)

* Attacker's Goal: To view the application's environment variables.
* This path is high-risk because environment variables often contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and secret keys.
    * **Trigger Application Error [!] (Critical Node):**
        * Attack Vector: Causing the application to throw an error, which then displays the `better_errors` page including environment variables.
        * This is a critical node because it's the necessary step to trigger the display of sensitive information.
