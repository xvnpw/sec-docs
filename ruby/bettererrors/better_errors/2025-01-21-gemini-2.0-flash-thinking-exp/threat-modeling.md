# Threat Model Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Interactive Console](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_interactive_console.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via Interactive Console
    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses an error page with the interactive console (Pry or IRB) enabled in a non-development environment. They can then execute arbitrary Ruby code on the server with the privileges of the application process. This allows them to perform any action the application can, including reading/writing files, accessing databases, and potentially compromising the entire server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `better_errors`'s interactive console feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolutely ensure** the interactive console is disabled in production and staging environments.
        *   Verify the configuration settings that control the console's activation.
        *   Implement network security measures to restrict access to non-production environments.

## Threat: [Sensitive Variable Inspection](./threats/sensitive_variable_inspection.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Variable Inspection
    *   **Description:** An attacker views an error page and uses the variable inspection feature of `better_errors` to examine the values of local and instance variables at the point of the error. This can expose sensitive information such as user credentials, API keys, session tokens, database connection details, or other confidential data present in the application's memory.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for account takeover, unauthorized access to external services, and compromise of internal systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `better_errors`'s variable inspection functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `better_errors` in production and staging environments.
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in variables for extended periods.
        *   Implement proper secrets management practices and avoid hardcoding credentials.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Environment Variables](./threats/information_disclosure_via_environment_variables.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses the interactive console (if enabled) or potentially other features of `better_errors` to inspect the environment variables of the application. These variables might contain sensitive configuration details, API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of critical application secrets, leading to unauthorized access to resources and potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially the interactive console or any feature that allows inspecting the application's environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `better_errors` and its interactive console in production and staging environments.
        *   Implement secure environment variable management practices (e.g., using tools like `dotenv` in development but secure vault solutions in production).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables where possible; use secure configuration management.
