## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to gain access to sensitive data by exploiting the error handling mechanism of the application when `better_errors` is enabled.
**Likelihood:** Medium - This relies on the application being misconfigured to show detailed errors in a non-development environment, which is a common mistake. It also requires an error to be triggered.
**Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive information can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Error Page with Sensitive Data (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/access_error_page_with_sensitive_data__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to successfully trigger an error in the application and access the resulting error page generated by `better_errors`.
**Likelihood:** Medium - Triggering an error can be achieved through various means (malformed input, exploiting bugs). Accessing the error page depends on the misconfiguration mentioned above.
**Impact:** High - This is the necessary step to view the sensitive data revealed by `better_errors`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Configured to Show Errors in Non-Development Environment (Critical Node, Start of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/application_configured_to_show_errors_in_non-development_environment__critical_node__start_of_high-r_ce872711.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a critical misconfiguration where the application is incorrectly set up to display detailed error pages (powered by `better_errors`) in production or staging environments.
**Likelihood:** Medium/High - This is a common oversight during deployment and configuration.
**Impact:** High - This directly enables the exposure of sensitive information when errors occur.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sensitive Data Revealed in Error Page (Critical Node, Continuation of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/sensitive_data_revealed_in_error_page__critical_node__continuation_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once the error page is accessible, `better_errors` displays detailed information, which can include sensitive data present in variables, stack traces, or the application's context at the time of the error.
**Likelihood:** High - If the error page is accessible, the potential for sensitive data to be present is high, depending on coding practices.
**Impact:** High - This directly leads to the leakage of sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (Critical Node, Start of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__critical_node__start_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to execute arbitrary code on the application server, gaining full control.
**Likelihood:** Low - This relies on a more severe misconfiguration (console enabled in production) or exploiting a vulnerability in console access.
**Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution allows the attacker to perform any action on the server, including data theft, modification, and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Interactive Console (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/access_interactive_console__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to gain access to the interactive console provided by `better_errors`.
**Likelihood:** Low - This depends on the console being enabled in a non-development environment or a successful bypass of any access controls (if they exist).
**Impact:** Critical - Access to the console is the gateway to achieving remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Console Enabled in Non-Development Environment (Critical Node, Continuation of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/console_enabled_in_non-development_environment__critical_node__continuation_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a critical misconfiguration where the interactive console feature of `better_errors` is unintentionally left active in production or staging environments.
**Likelihood:** Low - Less common than simply displaying errors, but still a significant risk if it occurs.
**Impact:** Critical - Directly enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via Console (Critical Node, Continuation of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_console__critical_node__continuation_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once access to the interactive console is gained, the attacker can execute arbitrary Ruby code within the context of the application.
**Likelihood:** High - If console access is achieved, code execution is straightforward.
**Impact:** Critical - This allows for a wide range of malicious activities, leading to full system compromise.
