# Attack Surface Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Pages](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_detailed_error_pages.md)

* **Description:** `better_errors` displays extensive information about errors, including the code, stack trace, local and instance variables, request parameters, and potentially environment variables.
* **How better_errors contributes:** It provides a user-friendly interface to view this detailed information directly in the browser when an error occurs.
* **Example:** An unauthenticated attacker accessing a development or staging environment encounters an error. The `better_errors` page reveals database credentials stored in an environment variable or an API key assigned to a local variable.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, internal logic, file paths, and user data. This can lead to further attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access to other systems.
* **Risk Severity:** High (in non-production environments if accessible) / Critical (if exposed in production).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strictly disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
    * **Implement strong access controls (e.g., VPNs, IP whitelisting, authentication) for development and staging environments.**
    * **Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables or local variables accessible by `better_errors`.** Consider using secure configuration management solutions.
    * **Review the information displayed by `better_errors` and ensure it doesn't inadvertently expose sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Interactive Console](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_interactive_console.md)

* **Description:** `better_errors` provides an interactive Ruby console (REPL) directly within the error page.
* **How better_errors contributes:** This feature allows execution of arbitrary Ruby code on the server with the privileges of the application process.
* **Example:** An attacker gains access to a development or staging environment and navigates to an error page. They use the interactive console to execute commands that create new administrative users, read sensitive files, or compromise the server.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including the ability to read and modify data, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (if accessible in any non-production environment).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Absolutely disable `better_errors` in production environments.**
    * **Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to development and staging environments.**
    * **Restrict network access to development and staging environments to trusted sources only.**
    * **Consider removing or disabling the interactive console feature if it's not essential for debugging in your development workflow.
