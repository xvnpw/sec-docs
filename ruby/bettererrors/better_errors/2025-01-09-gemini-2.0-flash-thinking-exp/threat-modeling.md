# Threat Model Analysis for bettererrors/better_errors

## Threat: [Source Code Exposure](./threats/source_code_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to an environment where `better_errors` is active can view the application's source code snippets displayed within the error page. This allows them to understand the application's logic, identify potential vulnerabilities, and discover sensitive information like hardcoded credentials or API keys. They might then use this knowledge to craft targeted attacks against the application.

**Impact:** Exposure of intellectual property, revealing of security vulnerabilities leading to further exploitation, potential compromise of sensitive data through discovered credentials.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Local Variable Exposure](./threats/local_variable_exposure.md)

**Description:** Attackers can view the values of local variables present at the point of the error, as displayed by `better_errors`. This can inadvertently expose sensitive data such as user credentials, API keys, temporary tokens, or other confidential information that happens to be in memory during an error. They can then use this exposed data for malicious purposes like unauthorized access or data breaches.

**Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive data leading to account compromise, unauthorized access to resources, and potential data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Interactive Console (REPL)](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_interactive_console__repl_.md)

**Description:** If the interactive console feature of `better_errors` is accessible in a non-development environment, an attacker can execute arbitrary Ruby code within the context of the application. This allows them to perform any action the application can, including reading and modifying data in the database, accessing the file system, executing system commands, and potentially gaining complete control over the server.

**Impact:** **Critical security vulnerability.** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and other severe consequences.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure in Non-Development Environments](./threats/accidental_exposure_in_non-development_environments.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration, improper deployment practices, or forgetting to disable `better_errors`, the gem might be active in staging or production environments. This unintentionally exposes all the vulnerabilities mentioned above to potential attackers.

**Impact:** Exposes the application to all the risks associated with `better_errors`, potentially leading to significant security breaches and data loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
