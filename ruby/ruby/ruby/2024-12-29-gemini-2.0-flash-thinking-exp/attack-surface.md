*   **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Deserialization
    *   **Description:**  Deserializing untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Ruby Contributes:** Ruby's `Marshal.load`, `YAML.load` (and `Psych.load` for YAML), and similar methods can instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects from serialized data. If the serialized data is attacker-controlled, they can craft malicious objects that execute code upon loading.
    *   **Example:** An application receives a serialized Ruby object from a user and uses `Marshal.load` to process it. A malicious user crafts a serialized object that, when loaded, executes a system command.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to fully compromise the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives or carefully sanitize the input.
        *   Consider using digital signatures to verify the integrity and origin of serialized data.
        *   For YAML, prefer safer loading options if available in newer versions or use schema validation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Code Injection via `eval` and Similar Methods
    *   **Description:**  Dynamically executing code based on user-controlled input.
    *   **How Ruby Contributes:** Ruby provides powerful methods like `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, and `module_eval` that allow executing arbitrary Ruby code at runtime. If the input to these methods is not carefully sanitized, attackers can inject and execute their own code.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input to dynamically define a method using `define_method` and `eval`. A malicious user provides input that includes harmful Ruby code, which is then executed.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Allows attackers to execute arbitrary Ruby code, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** use `eval` or similar methods with untrusted user input.
        *   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, explore safer alternatives like whitelisting allowed operations or using a sandboxed environment.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize any input used in dynamic code generation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection
    *   **Description:**  Executing arbitrary operating system commands through the application.
    *   **How Ruby Contributes:** Ruby provides easy ways to interact with the operating system using methods like `system`, `exec`, backticks (` `` `), and `IO.popen`. If the arguments to these methods are constructed using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a filename to process, and this filename is directly used in a `system` call to an external tool. A malicious user provides a filename like "; rm -rf /", which could delete critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to full system compromise, data deletion, service disruption, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `system`, `exec`, backticks, and `IO.popen` with user-provided input whenever possible.
        *   If executing external commands is necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that provide safer ways to interact with the operating system.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize any input used in command construction.
        *   Consider using chroot jails or containers to limit the impact of command injection.

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party Ruby libraries (gems).
    *   **How Ruby Contributes:** Ruby applications heavily rely on external libraries managed by RubyGems. Vulnerabilities in these gems can directly impact the security of the application.
    *   **Example:** An application uses an older version of a popular gem that has a known security vulnerability allowing for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a dependency management tool like Bundler to track and manage gem dependencies.
        *   Regularly update gem dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`, `brakeman`) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Be mindful of the security reputation and maintenance status of the gems you use.
