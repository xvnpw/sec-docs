### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `github.com/ruby/ruby`

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Ruby interpreter (`github.com/ruby/ruby`).

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via `eval()`-like methods
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Ruby code into data that is subsequently passed to methods like `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, or `module_eval`. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the Ruby interpreter's process. For example, they might manipulate input fields or configuration files to include malicious Ruby code that the application then executes.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `Kernel` module (methods like `eval`), `Object` module (methods like `instance_eval`), `Class` module (methods like `class_eval`), `Module` module (methods like `module_eval`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `eval()` and similar methods entirely if possible.
        *   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization based on a whitelist of allowed operations.
        *   Consider using safer alternatives like DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) or template engines with proper escaping.
        *   Employ sandboxing techniques or containerization to limit the impact of potential code execution.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized Ruby object (e.g., using `Marshal.dump` or `YAML.dump`) and trick the application into deserializing it using methods like `Marshal.load` or `YAML.load`. Upon deserialization, the malicious object can execute arbitrary code within the Ruby interpreter. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how objects are constructed or finalized during the deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Marshal` module (methods like `load`, `dump`), `YAML` module (methods like `load`, `dump`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of the serialized data.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON when possible, as they generally don't allow arbitrary code execution upon deserialization in Ruby.
        *   Restrict the classes that can be deserialized using mechanisms provided by serialization libraries if available.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Extensions (C Extensions)
    *   **Description:** Many Ruby gems, and sometimes even core Ruby components, include native extensions written in C or other languages for performance or to interface with system libraries. Attackers could exploit memory safety vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) in these extensions. They might provide crafted input that triggers these vulnerabilities, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the Ruby interpreter's process or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or memory corruption leading to unpredictable application behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The Ruby interpreter's interface for executing native extensions (often involving the Ruby C API). The vulnerability resides within the C code of the specific extension.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit gems with native extensions before including them in the project.
        *   Keep all gems, especially those with native extensions, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities in the extensions.
        *   Consider using tools like static analyzers or fuzzers on native extensions if feasible.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in popular gems with native extensions.

*   **Threat:** Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Ruby Versions
    *   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities present in older versions of the Ruby interpreter itself. These vulnerabilities are often publicly documented, making it easier for attackers to target applications running on outdated versions.
    *   **Impact:**  Various vulnerabilities depending on the specific flaw, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service directly within the Ruby interpreter.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Ruby interpreter codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the age and vulnerabilities of the version).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Ruby interpreter updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Regularly review security advisories for Ruby and apply necessary updates promptly.
        *   Use tools to manage Ruby versions (e.g., `rbenv`, `rvm`) to facilitate easy updates.
