**Title:** Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Chartkick

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data within the application utilizing Chartkick by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the library.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using Chartkick **CRITICAL NODE**
    * OR
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Chartkick Library **CRITICAL NODE**
            * OR
                * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Options ***HIGH RISK PATH***
                * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data ***HIGH RISK PATH***
        * Exploit Misconfigurations in Application Using Chartkick **CRITICAL NODE**
            * OR
                * Directly Embedding User-Controlled Data in Chart Options ***HIGH RISK PATH***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Compromise Application Using Chartkick**

* This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code or accessing sensitive data within the application.

**Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Chartkick Library**

* This node represents exploiting inherent weaknesses within the Chartkick library itself. If successful, it can lead to various attack vectors.

**High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Options**

* **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious JavaScript through chart configuration options (e.g., `title`, `library` options).
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and injects it into Chartkick's configuration options. If Chartkick doesn't properly sanitize these options, the injected script will execute in the user's browser when the chart is rendered.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on Chartkick's sanitization and developer usage).
    * **Impact:** High (Account takeover, data theft, malicious actions).
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of Chartkick options and XSS techniques).
    * **Skill Level:** Medium.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful inspection of rendered HTML and network activity).

**High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data**

* **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious JavaScript within data points or labels provided to Chartkick.
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the data points or labels that are used to generate the chart. If Chartkick doesn't sanitize this data, the script will execute in the user's browser when the chart is rendered.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on Chartkick's sanitization and backend data handling).
    * **Impact:** High (Account takeover, data theft, malicious actions).
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of data flow and XSS techniques).
    * **Skill Level:** Medium.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful inspection of rendered HTML and network activity).

**Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigurations in Application Using Chartkick**

* This node represents vulnerabilities introduced by how the application developers use Chartkick, rather than flaws in the library itself.

**High-Risk Path: Directly Embedding User-Controlled Data in Chart Options**

* **Attack Vector:** Application directly uses user input to populate Chartkick configuration without proper sanitization.
    * **Description:** Developers mistakenly use unsanitized user input (e.g., from URL parameters, form fields) directly in Chartkick's configuration options. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the user's browser.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common developer mistake).
    * **Impact:** High (XSS leading to account takeover, data theft).
    * **Effort:** Low (Requires identifying input points and injecting JavaScript).
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Easily detectable through code review and basic penetration testing).
