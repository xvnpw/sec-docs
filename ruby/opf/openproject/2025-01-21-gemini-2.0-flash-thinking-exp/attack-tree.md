## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the specific version of OpenProject being used. They then leverage existing exploit code or develop their own to target these weaknesses.

**Examples:** Exploiting a known SQL injection vulnerability to extract database credentials, leveraging a remote code execution flaw to gain shell access, or bypassing authentication using a known security flaw in the login mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the OpenProject application. This often involves exploiting memory corruption bugs, insecure deserialization flaws, or command injection vulnerabilities.

**Examples:** Uploading a malicious file that gets executed by the server, crafting a specific request that triggers a buffer overflow leading to code execution, or exploiting a flaw in a file processing function.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of OpenProject to gain access without providing valid credentials or to elevate their privileges beyond what is intended.

**Examples:** Exploiting a flaw in the session management to hijack another user's session, leveraging a vulnerability in the password reset functionality, or exploiting a logic error in the role-based access control system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Data Injection (e.g., SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_data_injection__e_g___sql_injection__nosql_injection_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify input fields or parameters within the OpenProject application that are not properly sanitized or validated. They then craft malicious input that includes SQL or NoSQL commands, which are then executed by the database, allowing them to extract, modify, or delete data.

**Examples:** Injecting malicious SQL code into a search field to retrieve all user credentials, manipulating a parameter in an API request to update sensitive project information, or exploiting a NoSQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_zero-day_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Highly skilled attackers discover previously unknown vulnerabilities in OpenProject. They then develop custom exploits for these vulnerabilities before a patch is available, making these attacks particularly dangerous.

**Examples:** Discovering a novel way to trigger a buffer overflow in a core component of OpenProject, finding a logic flaw in a newly introduced feature that allows for privilege escalation, or identifying a vulnerability in a third-party library used by OpenProject.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via Export/API Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_exportapi_abuse.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers misuse legitimate data export features or API endpoints provided by OpenProject to extract large amounts of sensitive project data. This can involve bypassing authorization checks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the export functionality, or simply abusing the intended functionality for malicious purposes.

**Examples:** Using an API endpoint to download all project files without proper authorization, exploiting a vulnerability in the CSV export feature to include additional sensitive data, or repeatedly querying an API endpoint to extract data in small chunks to avoid detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials or Weak Passwords [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials_or_weak_passwords__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to OpenProject using default administrator credentials or other accounts with commonly known or easily guessable passwords. This often targets initial setup or poorly managed deployments.

**Examples:** Trying common default usernames like "admin" with passwords like "password" or the application name, using lists of commonly used passwords against known user accounts, or exploiting publicly known default credentials for specific OpenProject versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure API Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_api_configurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify publicly accessible or poorly secured API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization mechanisms. They then exploit these endpoints to access or manipulate data without valid credentials.

**Examples:** Accessing an API endpoint that retrieves user information without requiring authentication, exploiting an API endpoint that allows modification of project settings without proper authorization checks, or using a weak or exposed API key to access sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Plugins or Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_plugins_or_extensions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or extensions installed within the OpenProject instance. These vulnerabilities can provide similar attack vectors as core OpenProject vulnerabilities, such as RCE, authentication bypass, or data injection.

**Examples:** Exploiting a known SQL injection vulnerability in a specific plugin's functionality, leveraging a remote code execution flaw in a vulnerable plugin to gain shell access, or bypassing authentication in a plugin to access restricted features.
