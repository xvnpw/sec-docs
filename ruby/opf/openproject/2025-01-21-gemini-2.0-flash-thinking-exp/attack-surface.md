# Attack Surface Analysis for opf/openproject

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Work Package Custom Fields](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_work_package_custom_fields.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for XSS, server-side code if the rendering engine is vulnerable) into custom fields of work packages.
*   **How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject allows administrators to define custom fields with various types, some of which might render user-provided content without proper sanitization, or allow for HTML input.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a custom field of type "Text (formatted)" and injects a `<script>alert("XSS");</script>` tag. When another user views the work package, the script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   Potential for Server-Side Code Execution (depending on rendering engine vulnerabilities): Full server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all custom field types.
        *   Use a secure templating engine that automatically escapes output by default.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.
        *   Regularly review and sanitize existing custom field data.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Educate administrators about the risks of allowing HTML or script tags in custom fields.
        *   Restrict the ability to create or modify certain custom field types to trusted administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wiki Pages](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_wiki_pages.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into wiki pages using the wiki markup language. These scripts are then executed when other users view the page.
*   **How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject's wiki functionality uses a markup language that, if not properly parsed and sanitized, can allow for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Example:** An attacker edits a wiki page and includes malicious JavaScript within an iframe or using other markup elements. When another user views the page, the script runs in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust sanitization of wiki markup input before rendering.
        *   Use a secure wiki rendering engine that prevents the execution of arbitrary scripts.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious about the content of wiki pages, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   Report suspicious content to administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload Leading to Malicious File Execution](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_malicious_file_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executables) as attachments to work packages or other areas, which can then be executed if the server is misconfigured or if vulnerabilities exist in how files are handled.
*   **How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject allows users to upload files as attachments. If file type validation is insufficient or bypassed, and if the server allows execution of these files, it creates a risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a harmless file. If the web server is configured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can access and control the server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root.
        *   Configure the web server to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache or configuration settings for Nginx).
        *   Implement antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of uploading untrusted files.
        *   Regularly review uploaded files for suspicious content.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in OpenProject's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to data or functionality.
*   **How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject provides a REST API for programmatic access. Vulnerabilities in how API keys, tokens, or session management are handled can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for administrators lacks proper authorization checks, allowing regular users to perform administrative actions. Or, API keys are easily guessable or exposed.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.
        *   Thoroughly test all API endpoints for authorization vulnerabilities.
        *   Use secure storage for API keys and tokens.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on API credentials.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Securely manage and rotate API keys.
        *   Restrict API access to trusted applications and users.
