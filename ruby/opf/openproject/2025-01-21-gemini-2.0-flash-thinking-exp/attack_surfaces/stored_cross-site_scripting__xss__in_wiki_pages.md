### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wiki Pages

#### 4.1. Understanding the Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization and/or encoding of user-supplied wiki markup before it is rendered to other users. When OpenProject processes wiki markup, it needs to interpret the markup to display formatted text, images, links, etc. If the system doesn't properly distinguish between legitimate markup and potentially malicious script tags or attributes, it can inadvertently execute the malicious code within a user's browser.

This often occurs because:

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system might not have strict rules about what constitutes valid wiki markup, allowing for the inclusion of HTML and JavaScript constructs.
*   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** Even if the input is validated to some extent, the output rendering process might not properly encode characters that have special meaning in HTML (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`). This allows injected HTML and JavaScript to be interpreted as code rather than plain text.
*   **Vulnerable Wiki Rendering Engine:** The underlying library or component used to render the wiki markup might have inherent vulnerabilities or lack robust security features.

#### 4.2. Detailed Attack Vectors

Beyond the basic example of using an `<iframe>`, attackers can leverage various wiki markup features and HTML elements to inject malicious scripts. Here are some potential attack vectors:

*   **Direct Script Tag Injection:** If the markup parser doesn't strip or encode `<script>` tags, attackers can directly embed JavaScript code.
    ```wiki
    This is some text. <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>
    ```
*   **Event Handler Injection:**  Malicious JavaScript can be injected through HTML attributes that handle events (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`).
    ```wiki
    ![Image with malicious onerror](https://example.com/image.jpg "Title" onerror="alert('XSS')")
    ```
    Or within links:
    ```wiki
    [[Link text|javascript:alert('XSS')]]
    ```
*   **`<iframe>` and `<frame>` Injection:** As mentioned in the description, these tags can be used to embed external content, including malicious pages that execute scripts.
    ```wiki
    {{iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://attacker.com/malicious.html"}}
    ```
*   **`<object>` and `<embed>` Tag Abuse:** These tags can be used to load external resources, potentially including Flash or other plugins that can execute arbitrary code.
    ```wiki
    {{object data="https://attacker.com/malicious.swf"}}
    ```
*   **SVG Injection:** Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files can contain embedded JavaScript. If the wiki allows embedding SVG images, malicious scripts can be executed.
    ```wiki
    ![Malicious SVG](https://attacker.com/malicious.svg)
    ```
*   **Data URI Schemes:**  Attackers might be able to use data URIs within image tags or other attributes to embed and execute JavaScript.
    ```wiki
    ![Data URI XSS](data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>)
    ```
*   **Markup Language Specific Exploits:**  Depending on the specific wiki markup language used by OpenProject (e.g., Textile, Markdown, etc.), there might be specific syntax or features that can be abused to inject HTML or JavaScript.

#### 4.3. Technical Details and Considerations

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the development team needs to consider the following technical aspects:

*   **Wiki Markup Parser:**  Identify the library or component used to parse the wiki markup. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is crucial.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Determine how the parsed markup is transformed into HTML for display in the user's browser.
*   **Sanitization Implementation (If Any):** Investigate if any sanitization mechanisms are currently in place and evaluate their effectiveness. Are they using a whitelist or blacklist approach? Are they context-aware?
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Assess whether a CSP is implemented and if it effectively restricts the execution of inline scripts and the loading of resources from untrusted origins.
*   **User Input Handling:** Analyze how user input is received, processed, and stored before being rendered.

#### 4.4. Detailed Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful Stored XSS attack on OpenProject wiki pages can be significant:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to the application and sensitive project data.
*   **Account Takeover:** By hijacking sessions or redirecting users to phishing pages, attackers can potentially gain full control of user accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to extract sensitive information displayed on the page or interact with the application's API to retrieve data.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of wiki pages, spreading misinformation or damaging the reputation of the project and the organization using OpenProject.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users viewing compromised wiki pages can be redirected to malicious websites that may host malware or phishing scams.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers can use the compromised wiki pages to distribute malware to users who view them.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator views a compromised wiki page, the attacker might be able to execute actions with administrator privileges.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks:**  Malicious scripts can be used to perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.

#### 4.5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

To effectively address the Stored XSS vulnerability, the following mitigation strategies should be implemented:

**For Developers:**

*   **Robust Input Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Prefer a whitelist approach where only explicitly allowed markup elements and attributes are permitted. This is generally more secure than a blacklist.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Sanitize input based on the context in which it will be used. For example, sanitizing text differently than URLs.
    *   **Use a Reputable Sanitization Library:** Integrate a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify or OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer (depending on the backend technology). Configure the library with strict settings.
    *   **Regularly Update Sanitization Libraries:** Ensure the chosen library is kept up-to-date to address newly discovered bypasses.
*   **Secure Wiki Rendering Engine:**
    *   Consider using a wiki rendering engine that is specifically designed to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   If using a custom rendering solution, thoroughly review the code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Output Encoding:**
    *   **Encode Output for HTML Context:**  Before rendering any user-supplied content in HTML, encode special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` using their HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#x27;`, `&amp;`). This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags or attributes.
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Configure a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    *   Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` and `style-src`. If inline scripts are necessary, use nonces or hashes.
    *   Consider using `frame-ancestors` to prevent the application from being embedded in malicious iframes.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on XSS vulnerabilities in the wiki functionality.
*   **Developer Training:**
    *   Educate developers on common XSS attack vectors and secure coding practices to prevent these vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.
*   **Consider a Preview Feature:**
    *   Implement a "preview" feature that renders the wiki content in a sandboxed environment or with strict sanitization before the user saves the changes. This allows users to verify the formatting without the risk of executing malicious scripts.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   While sanitization is crucial for output, input validation can help prevent some malicious input from even being stored. Validate the structure and format of the wiki markup.

**For Users:**

*   **Be Cautious of Content:**  As mentioned in the initial description, users should be aware of the potential risks and exercise caution when viewing wiki pages, especially from untrusted sources.
*   **Report Suspicious Content:**  Provide a clear mechanism for users to report suspicious content to administrators.

#### 4.6. Best Practices for Prevention

To prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future, the development team should adopt the following best practices:

*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Configure security settings with the most restrictive options by default.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies, including libraries and frameworks, up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to areas that handle user input and output rendering.
*   **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate automated security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early.
*   **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:** Establish a clear process for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.
