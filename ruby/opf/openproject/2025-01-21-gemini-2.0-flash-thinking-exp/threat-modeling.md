# Threat Model Analysis for opf/openproject

## Threat: [Insecure Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/insecure_default_administrator_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in using default administrator credentials (if not changed after installation) to gain full control over the OpenProject instance. This vulnerability stems from the initial setup process within the OpenProject codebase.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the OpenProject instance, including access to all projects, data, and user accounts. The attacker can modify, delete, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Installation process, User authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Force a password change for the default administrator account during the initial setup process within the OpenProject code.
*   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials within the application's documentation and setup guides.
*   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts within the authentication module.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Work Package Comments](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_work_package_comments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into work package comments. When other users view the comment, the script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf. This vulnerability resides in how OpenProject handles and renders user-provided content.

**Impact:** Account compromise of users viewing the malicious comment, potential data theft, defacement of the OpenProject interface for other users.

**Affected Component:** Work package comment rendering logic, Input sanitization functions within the codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side input sanitization for all user-provided content, especially in comment fields, within the OpenProject backend.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, configured within the application, to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Employ output encoding when rendering user-generated content within the view templates.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Role Manipulation](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_role_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited privileges could exploit vulnerabilities in OpenProject's role-based access control (RBAC) system to elevate their privileges, granting them access to sensitive projects or administrative functions they shouldn't have. This could involve manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in permission checks within the OpenProject code.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify critical project settings, potential for further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** User and permission management module, API endpoints for role assignment within the OpenProject API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test the RBAC implementation within the OpenProject codebase for any logical flaws.
*   Implement strict validation and authorization checks on all API endpoints related to user and role management within the API code.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to users, enforced by the RBAC system.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Attachments](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_attachments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., containing malware or scripts) as attachments to work packages. If these files are not properly scanned or if their access is not controlled by OpenProject's code, they could be downloaded and executed by other users.

**Impact:** Malware infection of user machines.

**Affected Component:** File upload functionality, Attachment storage and retrieval mechanisms within the OpenProject application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement virus scanning on all uploaded files within the file processing logic.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, controlled mechanism implemented within OpenProject.
*   Enforce strict file size and type restrictions within the upload functionality.
*   Set appropriate Content-Disposition headers to prevent automatic execution of downloaded files, configured by the application.

## Threat: [API Key Exposure and Abuse](./threats/api_key_exposure_and_abuse.md)

**Description:** If API keys are not securely generated, stored, or managed by OpenProject, an attacker could gain access to valid API keys. They could then use these keys to access and manipulate data through the OpenProject API without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to project data, ability to create, modify, or delete resources via the API, potential for data exfiltration or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** API authentication and authorization mechanisms, API key generation and management within the OpenProject API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong, randomly generated API keys within the API key generation process.
*   Store API keys securely (e.g., using encryption) within the application's data storage.
*   Implement proper access controls and rate limiting for API usage within the API implementation.
*   Provide mechanisms for users to regenerate or revoke API keys within the user settings.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./threats/insecure_password_reset_mechanism.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset functionality within OpenProject (e.g., predictable reset tokens, lack of account lockout after multiple failed attempts) could allow an attacker to reset another user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to projects and data.

**Affected Component:** Password reset functionality, User authentication module within the OpenProject codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens generated by the application.
*   Implement account lockout after multiple failed password reset attempts within the authentication logic.
*   Send password reset links over HTTPS, ensured by the application's configuration.
*   Consider multi-factor authentication for enhanced security, implemented within the authentication module.
