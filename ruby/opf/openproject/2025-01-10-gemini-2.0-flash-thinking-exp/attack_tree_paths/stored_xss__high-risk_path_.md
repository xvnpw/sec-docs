## Deep Analysis: Stored XSS (HIGH-RISK PATH) in OpenProject

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, let's delve into the "Stored XSS (HIGH-RISK PATH)" identified in your OpenProject attack tree analysis. This is a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention and robust mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack:**

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), also known as Persistent XSS, occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into an application's data stores (like a database). These scripts are then retrieved and executed by the browsers of other users when they view the affected content. The "high-risk" designation is accurate because this type of XSS has a significant and lasting impact.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attacker Identification of Vulnerable Input Points:** The attacker first identifies areas within OpenProject where user-provided data is stored and subsequently displayed to other users without proper sanitization or encoding. Common targets in OpenProject could include:
    * **Work Package Descriptions:**  Detailed descriptions of tasks, bugs, features, etc.
    * **Work Package Comments:**  User discussions and updates related to work packages.
    * **Wiki Pages:**  Collaborative documentation and knowledge bases.
    * **Forum Posts:**  Discussion threads within projects.
    * **Project Descriptions:**  Overviews of specific projects.
    * **Custom Fields:**  User-defined data fields associated with various entities.
    * **Meeting Agendas and Minutes:**  Stored records of meetings.
    * **Potentially File Names or Metadata:** Depending on how file uploads are handled.

2. **Malicious Script Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious script, typically using JavaScript, and injects it into one of the identified vulnerable input points. Examples of malicious scripts could include:
    * **Credential Harvesting:**  Scripts that redirect users to a fake login page and steal their credentials.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Scripts that steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    * **Keylogging:**  Scripts that record user keystrokes within the OpenProject interface.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Scripts that redirect users to websites hosting malware or phishing scams.
    * **Defacement:**  Scripts that alter the appearance of the OpenProject page for other users.
    * **Information Disclosure:**  Scripts that extract sensitive information from the page or the user's browser.
    * **Performing Actions on Behalf of the User:**  Scripts that trigger actions within OpenProject as the victim user (e.g., creating new work packages, changing statuses, deleting content).

3. **Storage in the Database:** The injected malicious script is then stored persistently in the OpenProject database alongside the legitimate user content.

4. **Victim Access and Script Execution:** When another user accesses the content containing the malicious script (e.g., views a work package, reads a wiki page), the script is retrieved from the database and rendered within their browser. The browser, unaware of the script's malicious intent, executes it within the context of the OpenProject application.

**Why is this HIGH-RISK?**

* **Persistence:** The attack is persistent. Once the malicious script is injected, it will affect all users who view the compromised content until it is manually removed.
* **Wide Impact:**  A single successful injection can potentially impact a large number of users within the OpenProject instance.
* **Account Compromise:** Attackers can steal credentials or session cookies, leading to full account takeover and the ability to perform actions as the compromised user.
* **Data Breach:**  Sensitive information within OpenProject can be accessed and exfiltrated.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Successful XSS attacks can damage the reputation of the organization using OpenProject.
* **Trust Erosion:** Users may lose trust in the security of the platform.
* **Potential for Lateral Movement:**  If a privileged user is compromised, the attacker might gain access to more sensitive areas or systems.

**OpenProject Specific Considerations:**

* **Rich Text Editors:** OpenProject likely uses rich text editors (e.g., CKEditor, TinyMCE) for formatting text in descriptions, comments, and wiki pages. These editors, if not properly configured and secured, can be a significant source of XSS vulnerabilities. Attackers might try to bypass editor sanitization or leverage vulnerabilities within the editor itself.
* **Markdown Support:** If OpenProject supports Markdown, attackers might attempt to inject HTML or JavaScript through crafted Markdown syntax.
* **Custom Field Handling:**  If custom fields allow for rich text input or are not properly sanitized during display, they can be exploited.
* **Notification System:**  If notifications display user-generated content, they could also be a vector for Stored XSS.
* **API Endpoints:** While less direct, vulnerabilities in API endpoints that handle user input and store data could also lead to Stored XSS.

**Mitigation Strategies (Actionable for the Development Team):**

1. **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (Server-Side):**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Input:** Only accept the necessary data and reject anything extraneous.
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define acceptable input patterns and reject anything that doesn't conform.
    * **HTML Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode special HTML characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`) into their corresponding HTML entities before storing data in the database. This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags.
    * **Contextual Encoding:** Encode output based on the context where it will be displayed (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings, URL encoding for URLs).
    * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce data format and prevent the injection of unexpected characters.

2. **Contextual Output Encoding (During Rendering):**
    * **Framework-Level Encoding:** Leverage the output encoding mechanisms provided by your development framework (e.g., Rails' `escape_javascript`, `html_safe` with caution, or similar functions in other frameworks).
    * **Template Engine Security:** Ensure your template engine (e.g., ERB in Ruby on Rails) is configured to automatically escape output by default.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a Strict CSP:** Define a policy that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS by preventing the execution of attacker-controlled scripts.
    * **`script-src 'self'`:**  Start with a restrictive policy like allowing scripts only from the same origin.
    * **Nonce or Hash-Based CSP:** Use nonces or hashes to allow inline scripts that are explicitly trusted.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to analyze the codebase for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities during runtime.
    * **Manual Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on security best practices and potential XSS injection points.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to perform penetration testing and identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed.

5. **Secure Configuration of Rich Text Editors:**
    * **Up-to-Date Editors:** Keep the rich text editor library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Restrict Allowed HTML Tags and Attributes:** Configure the editor to allow only a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes.
    * **Server-Side Sanitization of Editor Output:** Even if the editor has built-in sanitization, perform server-side sanitization as a defense-in-depth measure.

6. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **User Roles and Permissions:** Ensure users have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This can limit the impact if an attacker compromises a less privileged account.

7. **Regular Security Training for Developers:**
    * **Educate developers on common web security vulnerabilities, including XSS, and best practices for secure coding.**

8. **Stay Updated:**
    * **Regularly update OpenProject and its dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.**

**Detection and Prevention during Development:**

* **Integrate Security into the SDLC:** Make security a priority throughout the development lifecycle.
* **Use Security Linters and Analyzers:** Integrate tools that can automatically identify potential security flaws in the code.
* **Implement Unit and Integration Tests for Security:** Write tests that specifically check for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Real-World Examples in OpenProject Context:**

* **Scenario 1:** An attacker injects a malicious script into the description of a bug report. When a developer views the bug report to investigate, the script executes, potentially stealing their session cookie.
* **Scenario 2:** An attacker crafts a wiki page with embedded JavaScript that redirects users to a phishing site designed to steal their OpenProject credentials.
* **Scenario 3:** An attacker adds a comment to a work package containing a script that modifies the status of other work packages within the project without proper authorization.

**Conclusion:**

Stored XSS is a serious threat to the security and integrity of your OpenProject application. By understanding the attack path, its potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, your development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. A layered security approach, combining robust input validation, contextual output encoding, CSP, regular security assessments, and developer training, is crucial for building a secure and trustworthy platform. Prioritizing this high-risk path is essential to protect your users and your organization's data.
