# Attack Surface Analysis for opf/openproject

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within User-Generated Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__within_user-generated_content.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.

**How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject allows users to input rich text content in various areas like work package descriptions, comments, wiki pages, and forum posts. If this input is not properly sanitized and escaped before rendering, it can be exploited for XSS.

**Example:** A user adds a comment to a work package containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this work package, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, information theft, defacement of OpenProject pages.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding/escaping for all user-generated content. Use context-aware escaping (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript content).
    *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.
    *   Regularly review and update OpenProject's codebase and dependencies to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [OpenProject API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/openproject_api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how the OpenProject API authenticates users and authorizes access to resources. This can allow unauthorized access to data or functionalities.

**How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject exposes a comprehensive REST API for interacting with its features. Weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms (e.g., insecure token generation, lack of proper validation) or authorization logic (e.g., missing access controls, IDOR vulnerabilities exposed through the API) can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API's authentication process to obtain a valid API key for another user, allowing them to access that user's projects and data. Or, an API endpoint allows modification of a work package by simply changing its ID in the request, without proper permission checks.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the OpenProject instance.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the API (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    *   Implement robust authorization checks at the API endpoint level, ensuring users can only access resources they are explicitly permitted to access.
    *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in API endpoints. Use secure, opaque identifiers.
    *   Regularly audit API endpoints and their associated authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks on API authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Handling (Attachments)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_handling__attachments_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how OpenProject handles file uploads and downloads, potentially allowing malicious file uploads or unauthorized access to files.

**How OpenProject Contributes:** OpenProject allows users to upload files as attachments to various entities like work packages and wiki pages. Improper validation of file types, sizes, or content, and insecure storage or serving of these files can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious executable disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file content and relies solely on the extension, this executable could potentially be served and executed on a vulnerable client. Alternatively, a path traversal vulnerability in the download mechanism could allow access to files outside the intended attachment directory.

**Impact:** Malware distribution, remote code execution (if files are executed on the server or client-side), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
    *   Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially malicious content (e.g., using libraries for image processing or document sanitization).
    *   Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web server's document root, preventing direct access.
    *   Implement access controls to ensure only authorized users can download attachments.
    *   Configure the web server to serve uploaded files with appropriate security headers (e.g., `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`).
    *   Implement file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks through large file uploads.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

**Description:** An application exposes a direct reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file or database record, without proper authorization checks. Attackers can manipulate these references to access resources belonging to other users.

**How OpenProject Contributes:** If OpenProject uses predictable or sequential IDs for resources (e.g., work package IDs, project IDs) and doesn't properly verify a user's authorization to access a resource based on its ID, attackers can potentially access or modify resources they shouldn't. This can occur through direct manipulation of URLs or API parameters.

**Example:** A user can access another user's private work package by simply changing the work package ID in the URL, without any further authorization checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust authorization checks on all requests to access or modify resources, verifying that the current user has the necessary permissions.
    *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or API parameters. Use opaque, non-sequential identifiers (e.g., UUIDs).
    *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.
    *   Regularly audit access control mechanisms to ensure they are correctly implemented and enforced.
