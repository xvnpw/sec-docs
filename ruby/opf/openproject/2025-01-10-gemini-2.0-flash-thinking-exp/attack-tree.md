## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via OpenProject (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_openproject__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application via OpenProject (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within OpenProject to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This category encompasses attacks that aim to bypass the application's login mechanisms or gain access to resources that the attacker is not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Bypass Authentication (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

        * **Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers leverage publicly known security flaws in specific versions of OpenProject that allow them to bypass the login process without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Elevate Privileges (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/elevate_privileges__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Elevate Privileges (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_privilege_escalation_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

        * **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers exploit flaws in OpenProject's permission management logic to gain higher levels of access within the application, potentially granting them administrative rights.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This category involves attacks that exploit weaknesses in how OpenProject handles user-provided data. By injecting malicious input, attackers can execute unintended commands or scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code/Scripts (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_codescripts__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Inject Malicious Code/Scripts (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss__high-risk_path_.md)

            * **Stored XSS (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers inject malicious scripts that are permanently stored within OpenProject's database (e.g., in work package descriptions or wiki pages). These scripts are then executed when other users view the affected content.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

        * **SQL Injection (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database Queries (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_database_queries__high-risk_path_.md)

            * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database Queries (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields, which is then executed by the database, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit API Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This involves targeting vulnerabilities in OpenProject's Application Programming Interface (API), which allows external systems to interact with OpenProject.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse API Endpoints (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_api_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Abuse API Endpoints (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

        * **Data Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers exploit insecure API endpoints to directly modify sensitive data within OpenProject without proper authorization or validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Authentication/Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_authenticationauthorization_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Exploit API Authentication/Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers bypass or circumvent the authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting the API, gaining unauthorized access to its functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This involves exploiting known security flaws in the third-party libraries and components that OpenProject relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in OpenProject's Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_openproject's_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

    * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in OpenProject's Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (often with readily available exploits) in libraries used by OpenProject (e.g., Ruby gems, JavaScript libraries) to compromise the application.
