# Threat Model Analysis for opf/openproject

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via a Vulnerability in the Authentication Module](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_a_vulnerability_in_the_authentication_module.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a flaw in OpenProject's authentication logic (e.g., a logic error in password verification, a weakness in session handling) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without providing valid credentials. They might manipulate requests or exploit specific edge cases in the authentication flow within OpenProject's code.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete project data, impersonate users, and potentially gain administrative privileges within OpenProject.

**Affected Component:** OpenProject Core - Authentication module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep OpenProject updated with the latest security patches released by the OpenProject team.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible within OpenProject's configuration.
* Regularly review OpenProject's release notes and security advisories.
* Consider security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the OpenProject instance.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Leading to Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/authorization_bypass_leading_to_unauthorized_data_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in OpenProject's permission system (e.g., flaws in access control checks for projects, work packages, or attachments) to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify. This could involve manipulating API requests to OpenProject or exploiting inconsistencies in OpenProject's permission model.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive project data to unauthorized individuals, potential data breaches originating from OpenProject, and unauthorized modification of project information within OpenProject.

**Affected Component:** OpenProject Core - Authorization module, potentially specific modules like Work Packages or Documents within OpenProject.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions within OpenProject's user management.
* Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions configured within OpenProject.
* Keep OpenProject updated with the latest security patches.
* Report any suspicious access patterns observed within OpenProject.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) through a Vulnerability in File Upload Handling](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__through_a_vulnerability_in_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., a specially crafted image or document) that, when processed by OpenProject's file handling mechanisms, allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting OpenProject. This could be due to insufficient input validation or insecure file processing libraries used by OpenProject.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the OpenProject server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data stored by OpenProject, install malware on the server, or pivot to other systems on the network accessible to the OpenProject server.

**Affected Component:** OpenProject Core - File Upload module, potentially specific modules handling file processing (e.g., Documents, Attachments) within OpenProject.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure strict input validation for file uploads handled by OpenProject, including file type and size restrictions.
* Sanitize uploaded files processed by OpenProject and store them securely, preventing direct execution.
* Keep OpenProject and its underlying libraries updated with the latest security patches.
* Implement robust security measures on the server hosting OpenProject.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities Leading to Data Manipulation or Disclosure](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_manipulation_or_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in OpenProject's REST API (e.g., lack of proper input validation, insufficient authorization checks for API endpoints) to access or modify data without proper authorization. This could involve sending crafted API requests to OpenProject's API endpoints to retrieve sensitive information or alter project settings.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to and modification of project data managed by OpenProject, potential data breaches originating from OpenProject's API, and disruption of workflows within OpenProject.

**Affected Component:** OpenProject Core - REST API module, specific API endpoints related to data access and manipulation within OpenProject.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all API requests processed by OpenProject.
* Enforce proper authentication and authorization for all API endpoints exposed by OpenProject.
* Regularly audit OpenProject's API for security vulnerabilities.
* Implement rate limiting on OpenProject's API to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins or Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_installed_plugins_or_extensions.md)

**Description:** If OpenProject allows the installation of plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities in these third-party components could be exploited by attackers to compromise the OpenProject instance. This could include XSS, SQL injection, or RCE vulnerabilities within the plugin code interacting with OpenProject's core.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability and the privileges of the plugin within OpenProject, potentially ranging from data theft to complete server compromise of the OpenProject instance.

**Affected Component:** OpenProject Plugins/Extensions framework, specific vulnerable plugins within OpenProject.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the plugin and the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install plugins from trusted sources within OpenProject's plugin ecosystem.
* Keep installed plugins updated with the latest security patches provided by the plugin developers.
* Regularly review the security of installed plugins within OpenProject.
* Consider disabling or removing unnecessary plugins from the OpenProject installation.
