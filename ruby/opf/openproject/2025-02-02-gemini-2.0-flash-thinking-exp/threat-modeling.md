# Threat Model Analysis for opf/openproject

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_plugin_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a poorly coded or outdated OpenProject plugin. They could upload a malicious plugin or exploit an existing vulnerability in an installed plugin to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting OpenProject. This could be achieved by crafting malicious requests or exploiting insecure file upload functionalities within the plugin.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected OpenProject Component:** Plugins subsystem, specific vulnerable plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources (official OpenProject marketplace or verified developers).
    *   Regularly update all installed plugins to the latest versions.
    *   Implement a plugin review process before installation, including code analysis if possible.
    *   Run OpenProject and its plugins with the least privileges necessary.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting plugin vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Work Package Filtering](./threats/sql_injection_in_work_package_filtering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within work package filters (e.g., using the filter functionality in the work package module). If input sanitization is insufficient in the filtering logic, these malicious queries could be executed directly against the database. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands in some database configurations.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, authentication bypass, potential server compromise depending on database configuration.
*   **Affected OpenProject Component:** Work Package module, specifically the filtering functionality and database query generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, especially when handling user-supplied input in filters.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all filter parameters to prevent SQL injection attempts.
    *   Regularly perform static and dynamic code analysis to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Adopt a least privilege database access model for the OpenProject application user.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** OpenProject relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. A vulnerability, specifically leading to Remote Code Execution, exists in one of these dependencies. If OpenProject uses the vulnerable component of the dependency, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability through OpenProject to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected OpenProject Component:** Core application, all modules relying on vulnerable dependencies, dependency management system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan OpenProject's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
    *   Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions, including security patches.
    *   Implement a process for monitoring security advisories for OpenProject's dependencies.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to automate dependency vulnerability management.
    *   In case of a critical dependency vulnerability, consider temporary mitigations like WAF rules or disabling vulnerable features until a patch is applied.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Vulnerable File Upload Processing](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_vulnerable_file_upload_processing.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in OpenProject's file upload processing logic. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading specially crafted files or sending a large number of file upload requests, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the server. This can result in a Denial of Service, making OpenProject unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of OpenProject, impact on business operations relying on OpenProject.
*   **Affected OpenProject Component:** File upload functionality, attachments module, file processing libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if easily exploitable and significantly impacts availability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for uploaded files, including file type and content checks.
    *   Set limits on file size and the number of files that can be uploaded per user/session.
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling for file upload endpoints.
    *   Configure resource limits for the OpenProject application (CPU, memory).
    *   Regularly audit file upload processing logic for potential vulnerabilities.
