# Attack Surface Analysis for opf/openproject

## Attack Surface: [OpenProject Specific Code Vulnerabilities (Business Logic & Access Control Flaws)](./attack_surfaces/openproject_specific_code_vulnerabilities__business_logic_&_access_control_flaws_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities arising from flaws in OpenProject's custom code, specifically in business logic related to project management, workflow, and access control. These flaws can lead to significant security breaches unique to OpenProject's functionality.
*   **OpenProject Contribution:** OpenProject's core features and custom plugins are built with specific code. Errors in this code, particularly in permission checks and data handling within project workflows, can create exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A critical flaw in OpenProject's work package permission system allows a user with a low-privilege role to bypass authorization checks and modify sensitive project data or escalate their privileges to project administrator.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation leading to full project or instance compromise, disruption of critical project workflows, potential for further system exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous security-focused code reviews, especially for business logic and access control code. Utilize static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify potential flaws. Conduct thorough penetration testing specifically targeting OpenProject's custom functionalities and permission model. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, including negative security test cases. Follow secure coding practices and the principle of least privilege in code design.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Report any suspicious behavior or potential access control issues immediately. Stay informed about OpenProject security advisories and apply security updates promptly. Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting OpenProject's REST APIs. This grants unauthorized access to sensitive API endpoints and the underlying data and functionalities.
*   **OpenProject Contribution:** OpenProject exposes a comprehensive REST API for managing projects and data. Weaknesses or inconsistencies in API authentication and authorization implementation within OpenProject's code can be directly exploited to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** A critical API endpoint, intended for administrative tasks like project deletion, lacks proper authorization checks. An attacker can craft a malicious API request, bypassing authentication, and delete projects without valid credentials or administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Data breach through API access, unauthorized data manipulation or deletion via API calls, service disruption by abusing administrative APIs, potential for remote code execution if API vulnerabilities are chained with other flaws.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust and consistent authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints. Adhere to established API security best practices (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT). Thoroughly test API authorization logic for all user roles and permissions, including negative testing. Apply the principle of least privilege in API design and access control. Implement API rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**  Strictly control and monitor API access. Regularly review API access logs for suspicious activity. Implement network-level restrictions to limit API access to authorized sources. Utilize API gateways or web application firewalls (WAFs) to enhance API security.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Ruby Gems with Critical Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__ruby_gems_with_critical_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities present in third-party Ruby gems (libraries) that OpenProject directly depends on. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences within the OpenProject application.
*   **OpenProject Contribution:** OpenProject relies on numerous Ruby gems. If OpenProject uses versions of gems with known critical vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution, SQL injection), the application becomes directly vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Ruby gem that OpenProject utilizes. An attacker can exploit this gem vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the OpenProject server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution leading to full server compromise, data breach, complete service disruption, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Proactively monitor security advisories for all Ruby gem dependencies. Utilize automated dependency scanning tools to continuously identify vulnerable gems. Prioritize updating gems with critical vulnerabilities immediately. Implement a robust dependency management process, including pinning dependency versions and regular audits.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Keep OpenProject updated to benefit from dependency updates included in new releases. Implement vulnerability scanning for the deployed OpenProject instance to detect vulnerable dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories related to Ruby on Rails and Ruby gems.

## Attack Surface: [Default or Weak Credentials for Administrative Accounts](./attack_surfaces/default_or_weak_credentials_for_administrative_accounts.md)

*   **Description:** Critical risk arising from using default or easily guessable passwords for initial administrative accounts in OpenProject. This allows attackers to gain immediate and complete control over the OpenProject instance.
*   **OpenProject Contribution:** While OpenProject doesn't ship with *predefined* default passwords, insufficient guidance during installation or weak password policies can lead administrators to set weak passwords for initial accounts, creating a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An administrator sets a weak password like "admin" or "password123" for the initial OpenProject administrator account. Attackers can easily brute-force or guess these credentials, gaining full administrative access to OpenProject.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the OpenProject instance, including complete data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, and the ability to use OpenProject as a platform for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Installation Process):** Ensure the installation process *forces* users to set strong, unique passwords for initial administrative accounts. Provide clear and prominent guidance on strong password requirements and best practices during setup.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** **Immediately** change default or weak passwords upon initial installation. Enforce strong password policies for *all* user accounts, including administrators. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security. Regularly audit user accounts and password strength.
