*   This category represents fundamental weaknesses in how OpenProject verifies user identity and manages access permissions. Successful exploitation can grant attackers unauthorized access to the application and its data.

    *   **1.2. Session Hijacking/Fixation [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Focuses on vulnerabilities related to session management, allowing attackers to take over legitimate user sessions.
            *   **1.2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookies (OpenProject Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into OpenProject features that handle user-generated content (e.g., task descriptions, wiki pages, forum posts, custom fields). When another user views this content, the JavaScript executes in their browser.
                *   **Exploitation in OpenProject:**  If OpenProject does not properly sanitize user inputs in these areas, stored XSS vulnerabilities can arise. The malicious script can then steal the user's session cookie and send it to the attacker.
                *   **Impact:** Account takeover. The attacker can impersonate the victim user, gaining access to their projects, data, and potentially administrative privileges if the victim is an administrator.

    *   **1.3. Privilege Escalation within OpenProject [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Targets flaws in OpenProject's role-based access control (RBAC) or API authorization, allowing attackers to gain higher privileges than they are supposed to have.
            *   **1.3.1. Exploiting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers identify flaws in OpenProject's RBAC implementation. This could involve bypassing permission checks, exploiting misconfigurations in roles, or finding logic errors in how permissions are enforced.
                *   **Exploitation in OpenProject:**  By manipulating requests or exploiting vulnerabilities in the UI or API, an attacker might be able to elevate their privileges from a regular user to a project administrator or even a system administrator within OpenProject.
                *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive project data, ability to modify project settings, manipulate workflows, and potentially gain full control over the OpenProject instance.

            *   **1.3.2. API Abuse for Privilege Escalation (OpenProject API Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  If the application uses OpenProject's API, attackers target API endpoints that might have insufficient authorization checks. They attempt to access API endpoints or manipulate API requests in a way that allows them to perform actions beyond their authorized privileges.
                *   **Exploitation in OpenProject:**  By crafting specific API requests, an attacker might be able to bypass authorization checks and perform actions like creating projects, modifying user roles, or accessing sensitive data through the API, even if they lack the necessary permissions in the UI.
                *   **Impact:** Similar to RBAC exploitation, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential full control depending on the API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in OpenProject Modules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_openproject_modules__critical_node_.md)

    *   **2.1. SQL Injection in OpenProject Database Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Targets vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate database operations.
            *   **2.1.1. Exploiting Vulnerable Search Functionality (OpenProject Search) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into search queries within OpenProject's search features (e.g., task search, wiki search, user search). If OpenProject's search functionality does not use parameterized queries or secure ORM practices, this injected SQL code can be executed by the database.
                *   **Exploitation in OpenProject:** By crafting specific search terms containing SQL injection payloads, an attacker can bypass intended query logic and execute arbitrary SQL commands on the OpenProject database.
                *   **Impact:**  Database compromise. Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even potentially gain control of the database server itself, leading to full application compromise.

    *   **2.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenProject Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Targets vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is displayed to other users without proper encoding, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
            *   **2.2.1. Stored XSS in Task Descriptions, Comments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  As described in 1.2.1, attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content areas. This code is stored in the database and executed every time another user views the affected content.
                *   **Exploitation in OpenProject:**  If OpenProject fails to sanitize user inputs in these areas, stored XSS vulnerabilities become persistent. The malicious script can then be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface pages, or perform other actions in the context of the victim user's session.
                *   **Impact:** Account takeover (via session cookie theft), defacement, phishing attacks, and potential further exploitation depending on the malicious script's capabilities.
