# Threat Model Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Threat: [Malicious Procfile Command Execution](./threats/malicious_procfile_command_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Procfile (e.g., via compromised repository access or insecure deployment process) to include malicious commands. Foreman executes these commands during application startup, potentially allowing the attacker to gain shell access, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, application malfunction.
*   **Foreman Component Affected:** Procfile parsing and process execution logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control to the repository and deployment pipelines.
    *   Use code review processes for Procfile changes.
    *   Employ infrastructure as code and version control for Procfile management.
    *   Regularly audit Procfile content for unexpected or suspicious commands.
    *   Run Foreman processes with the least privilege necessary.
    *   Use immutable infrastructure to prevent runtime Procfile modifications.

## Threat: [Procfile Injection Vulnerability](./threats/procfile_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** If the Procfile is dynamically generated based on external input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the generated Procfile. Foreman then executes these injected commands.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Foreman Component Affected:** Procfile generation logic (external to Foreman core, but related to Foreman usage patterns).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamic Procfile generation based on untrusted input if possible.
    *   If dynamic generation is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all external inputs used to construct the Procfile.
    *   Use parameterized commands or whitelisting of allowed commands during dynamic generation.
    *   Implement input validation and encoding to prevent command injection.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to `.env` files or the environment where Foreman is running, revealing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or secrets stored as environment variables. This access could be through accidental commits, insecure storage, or server compromise.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external services, privilege escalation.
*   **Foreman Component Affected:** Environment variable loading and management (related to how Foreman uses `.env` and system environment).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never commit `.env` files containing secrets to version control.
    *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of `.env` files for sensitive data.
    *   Encrypt `.env` files if they must be used.
    *   Implement strict access control to servers and environments where Foreman runs.
    *   Regularly audit environment variable configurations for exposed secrets.
    *   Use environment variable substitution features of deployment tools securely.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Manipulation](./threats/environment_variable_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify environment variables used by Foreman processes. This could be achieved through server compromise or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems managing environment variables. Manipulated variables can alter application behavior, bypass security checks, or grant unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, security bypass, privilege escalation, data breach.
*   **Foreman Component Affected:** Environment variable loading and process environment setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access control to servers and systems managing environment variables.
    *   Use immutable infrastructure to prevent runtime environment variable modifications.
    *   Monitor environment variable changes for unauthorized modifications.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to processes and users accessing environment variables.
    *   Consider using containerization and orchestration tools for better environment isolation and management.

## Threat: [Insecure Production Deployment Practices with Foreman](./threats/insecure_production_deployment_practices_with_foreman.md)

*   **Description:** Using Foreman in production without proper security considerations, such as running Foreman as root, exposing management interfaces, or lacking network security, can create significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Foreman Component Affected:** Deployment configuration and operational practices (external to Foreman core, but related to Foreman usage in production).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid running Foreman as root in production. Use dedicated user accounts with minimal privileges.
    *   Do not expose Foreman's internal interfaces (if any are exposed in specific Foreman setups) to the public internet.
    *   Implement strong network security measures, including firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   Follow security best practices for server hardening and operating system security.
    *   Consider using more robust process management and orchestration tools for production deployments instead of basic Foreman setups if security and scalability are critical.
