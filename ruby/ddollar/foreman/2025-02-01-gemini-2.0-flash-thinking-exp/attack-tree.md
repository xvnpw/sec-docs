## Attack Tree Path: [Procfile Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/procfile_manipulation.md)

**1. Procfile Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where the `Procfile` is stored. This could be through:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web application itself (e.g., file upload, remote code execution).
    *   Compromising the server infrastructure (e.g., SSH brute-force, OS vulnerabilities).
    *   Social engineering or insider threats.
*   **Critical Node: Procfile Modification:** Once access is gained, the attacker directly modifies the `Procfile`.
*   **Critical Node: Malicious Command Injection in Procfile:** The attacker injects malicious commands into process definitions within the `Procfile`. This is achieved by:
    *   Adding new process definitions that execute malicious code.
    *   Modifying existing process definitions to include malicious commands, often leveraging shell features.
*   **Impact:**  Critical. Successful Procfile manipulation allows the attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the application processes.
    *   Gain persistent access to the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   Steal sensitive data, modify application behavior, or cause complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Process Control Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/process_control_exploitation.md)

**2. Process Control Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Attack Vector:** The `Procfile` is designed or constructed in a way that allows for command injection vulnerabilities. This happens when:
    *   The `Procfile` uses dynamic input (e.g., environment variables, user-provided data) in process definitions without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   Shell interpretation features (backticks, `$(...)`, etc.) are used in process definitions with untrusted input.
*   **Critical Node: Command Injection Vulnerability in Procfile:** A vulnerability exists in how the `Procfile` is constructed, allowing for command injection.
*   **Critical Node: Unsafe Input in Procfile:** The `Procfile` accepts and uses input that is not properly validated or sanitized, creating an injection point.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Command injection via `Procfile` allows the attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application processes.
    *   Bypass application security controls.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges if the application processes run with elevated permissions.
    *   Steal data, modify application behavior, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Environment Variable Leakage (Information Disclosure)](./attack_tree_paths/environment_variable_leakage__information_disclosure_.md)

**3. Environment Variable Exploitation - Leakage [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Attack Vector:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database passwords, or other credentials, is stored in environment variables.
*   **Critical Node: Secrets in Environment Variables:**  The application relies on environment variables to store sensitive secrets.
*   **Critical Node: Logging Sensitive Environment Variables:** Foreman or the application logging mechanisms inadvertently log or output these environment variables. This can occur in:
    *   Application logs (e.g., during startup, error messages).
    *   Foreman logs or output (e.g., during process start, debugging).
    *   Error reporting systems that capture environment variables.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Environment variable leakage leads to:
    *   Information disclosure of sensitive credentials.
    *   Potential unauthorized access to external services or internal systems if leaked credentials are compromised.
    *   Damage to reputation and trust if sensitive data is exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses - Elevated Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_elevated_privileges.md)

**4. Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses - Elevated Privileges [CRITICAL NODE: Foreman Running with Elevated Privileges]**

*   **Attack Vector:** Foreman is mistakenly configured to run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root user).
*   **Critical Node: Foreman Running with Elevated Privileges:** The Foreman process itself runs with root or highly privileged user permissions.
*   **Critical Node: System Privilege Escalation:** If any process managed by Foreman is then exploited (e.g., through command injection), the attacker can leverage Foreman's elevated privileges to escalate their own privileges to root or system level.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Running Foreman with elevated privileges significantly amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities, leading to:
    *   Full system compromise if a process managed by Foreman is exploited.
    *   Unrestricted access to all system resources and data.
    *   Complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses - Insufficient Input Validation in Procfile Generation](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_insufficient_input_validation_in_procfile_generation.md)

**5. Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses - Insufficient Input Validation in Procfile Generation [CRITICAL NODE: Insufficient Input Validation in Procfile Generation]**

*   **Attack Vector:** In complex deployment pipelines, the `Procfile` might be generated dynamically based on user input or configuration data.
*   **Critical Node: Insufficient Input Validation in Procfile Generation:** The system responsible for generating the `Procfile` lacks proper input validation and sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High. Insufficient input validation in `Procfile` generation can lead to:
    *   Introduction of vulnerabilities (like command injection) directly into the generated `Procfile`.
    *   Automated creation of insecure configurations.
    *   Widespread vulnerability across deployments if the flawed generation process is used repeatedly.
