# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To provide developers with a simple and efficient way to manage and run Procfile-based applications locally, mimicking a production-like environment.
 - Priority: Ease of use and developer productivity.
 - Priority: Consistency between development and production environments.
 - Priority: Support for various application types and dependencies managed through Procfiles.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Misconfiguration of local development environments leading to discrepancies with production, causing deployment issues.
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in Foreman itself or its dependencies could expose developer machines or local development environments.
 - Risk: Lack of standardization in development environments across teams can lead to inconsistencies and collaboration challenges.
 - Risk: Potential for developers to inadvertently expose sensitive data if Foreman is not properly secured or configured.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Operating system level security controls on developer machines (e.g., user permissions, firewalls). Implemented by: Operating System.
 - security control: Network security controls on developer networks (e.g., firewalls, network segmentation). Implemented by: Network Infrastructure.
 - security control: Code review processes for contributions to the Foreman project itself. Implemented by: Foreman project maintainers (GitHub repository).
 - accepted risk: Reliance on developer machines' security posture, which can vary significantly.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Foreman.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency scanning for Foreman and its dependencies to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Regular security audits of Foreman codebase to identify potential security flaws.
 - security control: Secure configuration guidelines for Foreman to minimize potential security risks.
 - security control: Least privilege principle applied to Foreman processes and file system access.
 - security control: Consider signing releases of Foreman to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Foreman itself does not require user authentication as it is primarily a local development tool.
  - Requirement: If Foreman is extended or used in a shared development environment, consider adding authentication mechanisms to control access.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Foreman should operate with the least privileges necessary to manage processes and access required resources.
  - Requirement: Access to Foreman configuration and control should be limited to authorized developers.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Foreman should validate inputs from Procfiles and command-line arguments to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
  - Requirement: Handle errors and exceptions gracefully to avoid exposing sensitive information.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for Foreman in its core functionality as a local process manager.
  - Requirement: If Foreman is extended to handle sensitive data or network communication, appropriate cryptographic measures should be implemented to protect data in transit and at rest.

```

- Build Process Description:
 - 1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
 - 2. A Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or manual build process) is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push to repository, tag creation).
 - 3. Dependency Resolution: The build system resolves and downloads project dependencies using a dependency management tool like Bundler for Ruby gems.
 - 4. Linters & SAST: Static analysis security testing (SAST) tools and linters are run to identify potential code quality issues and security vulnerabilities.
 - 5. Build Artifacts: The project is built, and build artifacts are created. For a Ruby gem, this would be a `.gem` file.
 - 6. Gem Hosting: The build artifact (gem file) is published to a gem hosting service like rubygems.org, making it available for download and installation.
 - 7. Developer Machine: Developers install Foreman on their machines using `gem install foreman`, downloading the gem from the hosting service.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Protecting developer productivity and efficiency by providing a reliable and easy-to-use local development environment.
 - Ensuring consistency between development and production environments to reduce deployment issues.
 - Maintaining the integrity and security of the Foreman tool itself to prevent it from becoming a source of vulnerabilities in developer workflows.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Procfile content: May contain sensitive information like environment variables, command-line arguments, or application configurations. Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the content.
 - Application code and data managed by Foreman: Can be highly sensitive, depending on the application being developed. Sensitivity: High, potentially including intellectual property, personal data, or financial information.
 - Developer machine security: Compromise of developer machines can lead to broader security breaches. Sensitivity: High.
 - Foreman gem itself: If compromised, could be used to distribute malware to developers. Sensitivity: High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended scope of usage for Foreman? Is it strictly for individual developer machines, or are there plans for shared development environments?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements that Foreman needs to adhere to (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
 - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding the security of developer tools?
 - Are there existing security policies or guidelines that Foreman development and usage should align with?
 - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Foreman?

- Assumptions:
 - Foreman is primarily used as a local development tool by individual developers.
 - Security focus is on preventing vulnerabilities in Foreman itself and ensuring it does not introduce security risks to developer machines or workflows.
 - Standard secure software development lifecycle practices are expected for the Foreman project.
 - Developers using Foreman are responsible for the security of their own applications and data managed by Foreman.
 - The organization using Foreman has basic security controls in place for developer machines and networks.
