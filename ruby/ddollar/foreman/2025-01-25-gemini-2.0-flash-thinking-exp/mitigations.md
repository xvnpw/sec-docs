# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Commit `.env` Files Used by Foreman to Version Control](./mitigation_strategies/never_commit___env__files_used_by_foreman_to_version_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prevent `.env` File Commits for Foreman Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** In the root directory of your project, open the `.gitignore` file (create one if it doesn't exist). Add `.env` to a new line in this file. This prevents Git from tracking `.env` files, which Foreman often uses for environment variables.
    2.  **Verify `.env` is Ignored:** Run `git status` in your terminal. Ensure that `.env` is listed under "Untracked files" or not listed at all if it wasn't previously tracked. If it's still tracked, remove it from the Git cache using `git rm --cached .env`.
    3.  **Automated CI/CD Check (Optional but Recommended):** Integrate a step in your CI/CD pipeline to check for `.env` files in the repository and fail the pipeline if detected, preventing accidental commits of Foreman configuration secrets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control (High Severity):** Committing `.env` files, commonly used by Foreman to load environment variables including secrets, exposes sensitive data (API keys, credentials) to anyone with repository access.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for secret exposure related to Foreman configuration. Effectively eliminates the risk of committing `.env` files containing Foreman-managed secrets.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` in the root of the application repository.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated CI/CD check for `.env` file commits is not yet implemented to specifically catch Foreman configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Secure Secrets Management Solutions for Foreman Environment Variables](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_secure_secrets_management_solutions_for_foreman_environment_variables.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Secrets Management Service for Foreman
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Secrets Management Service:** Select a service like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
    2.  **Configure Secrets in the Service:** Store application secrets intended for Foreman environment variables (database credentials, API keys, etc.) within the chosen secrets management service.
    3.  **Foreman Integration:** Modify your deployment process to retrieve secrets from the secrets management service and inject them as environment variables when Foreman starts the application processes. This avoids relying on `.env` files for sensitive information loaded by Foreman.
    4.  **Remove `.env` Secret Dependency (Production):** Eliminate the need for `.env` files to contain sensitive information in production environments. Foreman should receive secrets directly from the secrets manager at runtime.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hardcoded Secrets in Foreman Configuration Files (`.env`) (High Severity):** Storing secrets in `.env` files, even if not committed, is risky if the server is compromised. Foreman's reliance on `.env` for variables makes this a direct threat.
    *   **Secret Sprawl and Management Overhead for Foreman Variables (Medium Severity):** Managing secrets across multiple `.env` files used by Foreman and environments becomes complex.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for secret exposure in Foreman configurations and improves secret management. Centralizes secret management for Foreman and enhances security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. AWS Secrets Manager is used for database credentials, some of which are used by Foreman-managed processes in production.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not all secrets used as Foreman environment variables are migrated to AWS Secrets Manager. API keys and other application secrets intended for Foreman are still managed via environment variables set during deployment, but not through a dedicated secrets management service for all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict File System Permissions on `.env` Files Used by Foreman (If Used)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_file_system_permissions_on___env__files_used_by_foreman__if_used_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `.env` File Permissions for Foreman
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Foreman Application User and Group:** Determine the user and group under which Foreman and its managed application processes are running.
    2.  **Set File Permissions:** Use `chmod 600 .env` to set read/write permissions only for the owner of the `.env` file, which Foreman might use.
    3.  **Set File Ownership:** Use `chown appuser:appgroup .env` to set the owner and group of the `.env` file to the user and group running Foreman and the application.
    4.  **Verify Permissions:** Use `ls -l .env` to confirm permissions are `-rw-------` and ownership is correct for the Foreman user and group.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets in Foreman `.env` via File System (Medium Severity):** If `.env` files used by Foreman are world-readable, attackers gaining server access can read sensitive information intended for Foreman's environment.
*   **Impact:** **Medium Risk Reduction** for unauthorized access to secrets in Foreman's `.env` files on the server. Limits access to only the intended Foreman application user.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, file permissions are set to `600` and ownership is set to the application user and group on production servers where Foreman uses `.env` files.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent enforcement across all environments (staging, development) where Foreman might use `.env`. Automated checks during deployment to ensure correct permissions for Foreman's `.env` files are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Variable Injection for Foreman Processes During Deployment](./mitigation_strategies/environment_variable_injection_for_foreman_processes_during_deployment.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Inject Foreman Environment Variables at Deployment
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Deployment Pipeline:** Modify your CI/CD pipeline or deployment scripts to directly set environment variables for Foreman processes during deployment.
    2.  **Avoid `.env` Files in Production for Foreman Secrets:** Eliminate deploying `.env` files containing secrets for Foreman to production servers. The deployment process should dynamically inject these variables for Foreman.
    3.  **Secrets Management Integration (Recommended):** Fetch secrets from your secrets management service during deployment and inject them as environment variables for Foreman to use when starting processes.
    4.  **Deployment Tool Configuration:** Utilize features of deployment tools (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, AWS ECS Task Definitions, Ansible) to securely inject environment variables that Foreman will use.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Deployed Files Used by Foreman (Medium Severity):** `.env` files on disk, even with permissions, are a target if compromised. Injecting variables for Foreman avoids storing secret files on the server.
    *   **Configuration Drift in Foreman Environments (Low Severity):** Managing `.env` files for Foreman across servers can lead to inconsistencies. Centralized injection reduces drift in Foreman configurations.
*   **Impact:** **Medium Risk Reduction** for secret exposure in Foreman deployments and improves configuration management. Reduces the attack surface by not having secret files for Foreman on disk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Deployment pipeline injects some environment variables for Foreman, but still relies on `.env` files for some configurations in non-production environments where Foreman is used.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full transition to environment variable injection for all Foreman configurations, especially in staging and development. Complete removal of `.env` file dependency for Foreman in production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Environment Variables Used by Foreman](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_environment_variables_used_by_foreman.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Periodic Foreman Environment Variable Audit
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Document Foreman Environment Variables:** Create a document listing all environment variables used by applications managed by Foreman. Include variable name, purpose, sensitivity level, and source.
    2.  **Schedule Regular Audits:** Set a recurring schedule for reviewing the documentation and actual environment variable configuration used by Foreman in each environment.
    3.  **Verify Necessity and Sensitivity for Foreman Variables:** Verify if each variable used by Foreman is still necessary. Re-evaluate sensitivity and ensure appropriate security for sensitive variables used by Foreman.
    4.  **Remove Obsolete Foreman Variables:** Remove any unused environment variables intended for Foreman to minimize potential exposure.
    5.  **Update Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect changes made during the audit of Foreman environment variables.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unnecessary Secret Exposure in Foreman Environment (Low Severity):** Unused environment variables, some containing secrets intended for Foreman, might accumulate. Audits help identify and remove these.
    *   **Configuration Creep and Complexity in Foreman Setup (Low Severity):** Unmanaged environment variables for Foreman can lead to configuration complexity.
*   **Impact:** **Low Risk Reduction** for secret exposure in Foreman configurations, but improves security hygiene and reduces configuration complexity related to Foreman.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, regular environment variable audits specifically for Foreman configurations are not currently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a process and schedule for regular audits of environment variables used by Foreman. Create initial documentation of these variables.
