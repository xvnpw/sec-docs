# Threat Model Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Foreman Execution](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_foreman_execution.md)

**Description:** If Foreman itself is run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root), the processes it manages might inherit those privileges. An attacker who can compromise one of these processes could then leverage these elevated privileges to perform actions they would not normally be authorized to do, potentially leading to full system compromise. This directly involves Foreman's process spawning and privilege handling.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to all resources, data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Process spawning and privilege inheritance within Foreman.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Run Foreman with the least necessary privileges. Create a dedicated user account with minimal permissions for running Foreman.
*   Ensure the processes managed by Foreman also run with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running application processes as root.
*   Utilize containerization or other isolation techniques to limit the impact of compromised processes, even if they inherit some privileges.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Uncontrolled Process Spawning](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_uncontrolled_process_spawning.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor or a bug (either in the application or potentially within Foreman's process management logic) could cause Foreman to spawn an excessive number of processes. This directly involves Foreman's core functionality of managing and spawning processes, potentially overwhelming system resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, impact on other services.

**Affected Component:** Process management and spawning logic within Foreman.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement resource limits for processes managed by Foreman (if supported by the underlying system or containerization platform).
*   Monitor resource usage of Foreman and its managed processes.
*   Review the `Procfile` and application logic to identify potential areas where uncontrolled process spawning could occur. While the application can cause this, Foreman's lack of safeguards contributes to the threat.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Foreman itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_foreman_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, the Foreman codebase itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the server running Foreman, or cause a denial of service. This directly involves the security of the Foreman application code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** The core Foreman application code.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Foreman updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in Foreman.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the Foreman codebase if you are contributing to or heavily modifying it.

## Threat: [Lack of Secure Communication for Remote Management (If Applicable)](./threats/lack_of_secure_communication_for_remote_management__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If Foreman offers any features for remote management or monitoring, and these features do not utilize secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS with proper TLS configuration), an attacker could eavesdrop on or tamper with the communication. This directly involves the security of Foreman's remote management capabilities.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, remote code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Remote management or monitoring interfaces within Foreman (if they exist).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure all remote management interfaces utilize secure communication protocols like HTTPS with strong TLS configuration.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for remote access.
*   Restrict access to remote management interfaces to authorized networks or individuals.
