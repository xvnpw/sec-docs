## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application Execution via Procfile -> Modify Procfile Content](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_execution_via_procfile_-_modify_procfile_content.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains the ability to alter the contents of the `Procfile`. This could be achieved by directly compromising the filesystem where the `Procfile` resides or by compromising the source code repository where it is managed. Once the `Procfile` is under the attacker's control, they can modify the commands executed by Foreman, effectively dictating the application's behavior and potentially executing arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized write access to the filesystem containing the Procfile](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_write_access_to_the_filesystem_containing_the_procfile.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If an attacker gains write access to the filesystem location where the `Procfile` is stored, they can directly modify its contents. This could be due to misconfigured file permissions, compromised user accounts, or vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system. This access allows for complete control over the application's startup commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the source code repository containing the Procfile](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_source_code_repository_containing_the_procfile.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the `Procfile` is managed within a source code repository (like Git), compromising the repository allows the attacker to modify the `Procfile` and commit those changes. This could involve compromising developer accounts, exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository hosting platform, or social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application Execution via Procfile -> Inject Malicious Commands into Procfile](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_execution_via_procfile_-_inject_malicious_commands_into_procfile.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even without completely replacing the `Procfile`, an attacker can inject malicious commands into existing process definitions. This often involves leveraging shell features like backticks or command substitution within the process definitions. When Foreman executes these commands, the injected malicious code will also be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Environment Variable Expansion Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_environment_variable_expansion_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can craft specially designed environment variable values that, when expanded by the shell during process execution, result in the execution of arbitrary commands. This exploits the shell's variable expansion mechanism to inject and run malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized write access to Foreman's environment configuration files (e.g., `.env`)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_write_access_to_foreman's_environment_configuration_files__e_g_____env__.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Similar to the `Procfile`, gaining write access to Foreman's environment configuration files (often `.env` files) allows an attacker to inject or modify environment variables. This can be used to inject malicious configurations, overwrite legitimate credentials, or introduce variables that can be exploited through expansion vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman's Process Management Capabilities -> Launch Malicious Processes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman's_process_management_capabilities_-_launch_malicious_processes.md)

**Attack Vector:** If an attacker can modify the `Procfile`, they can define new processes that execute malicious code alongside the legitimate application processes. Foreman will then launch and manage these malicious processes as part of the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Foreman Itself -> Exploit Known Foreman Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_foreman_itself_-_exploit_known_foreman_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Foreman, like any software, may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can research and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Foreman's codebase if the application is running an outdated or unpatched version. Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including arbitrary code execution.
