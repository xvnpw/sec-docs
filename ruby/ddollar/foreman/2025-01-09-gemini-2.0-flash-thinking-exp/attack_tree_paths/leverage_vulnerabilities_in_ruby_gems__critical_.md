    * **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Foreman. This is often the most critical outcome.
    * **Techniques:**
        * Crafting malicious input that, when processed by the vulnerable gem, leads to code execution (e.g., through insecure deserialization, command injection, or flaws in input sanitization).
        * Leveraging vulnerabilities in web frameworks or libraries used by gems that allow for direct code injection.
    * **Success Condition:** Executing arbitrary commands on the Foreman server.
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, installation of malware, denial of service.
    * **Mitigation:** Input validation and sanitization, avoiding insecure deserialization, using secure coding practices within gems, sandboxing or containerization of the application.
* **2.2. SQL Injection:**
    * **Description:** If a vulnerable gem interacts with a database without proper input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to manipulate or extract data.
    * **Techniques:**
        * Crafting malicious input that is passed to database queries through the vulnerable gem.
        * Exploiting flaws in database abstraction layers or ORMs used by the gem.
    * **Success Condition:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Foreman database or manipulating its data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the application.
    * **Mitigation:** Using parameterized queries or prepared statements, employing ORMs with built-in protection against SQL injection, and rigorous input validation.
* **2.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Description:** While less critical for a backend application like Foreman, some gems might be involved in generating web content or APIs. Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in these gems can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application's interface, potentially targeting administrators or users interacting with it.
    * **Techniques:**
        * Injecting malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable gem outputs or APIs.
    * **Success Condition:** Executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser accessing Foreman.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    * **Mitigation:** Proper output encoding and escaping, using Content Security Policy (CSP).
* **2.4. Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability that causes the application to crash or become unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
    * **Techniques:**
        * Sending specially crafted input that triggers a resource exhaustion bug in the vulnerable gem.
        * Exploiting algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities that lead to excessive CPU or memory usage.
    * **Success Condition:** Making the Foreman application unavailable.
    * **Impact:** Disruption of service, financial losses, reputational damage.
    * **Mitigation:** Resource limits, rate limiting, input validation, and robust error handling within gems.
* **2.5. Authentication Bypass/Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Description:** Some gem vulnerabilities might allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms or escalate their privileges within the application.
    * **Techniques:**
        * Exploiting flaws in authentication or authorization logic within a gem.
        * Manipulating data structures or session information to gain elevated access.
    * **Success Condition:** Gaining unauthorized access to privileged functionalities or data within Foreman.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the application, ability to perform administrative actions.
