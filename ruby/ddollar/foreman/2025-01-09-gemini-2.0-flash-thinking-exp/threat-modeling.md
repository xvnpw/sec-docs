# Threat Model Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Exposure via Compromised `.env` File](./threats/sensitive_information_exposure_via_compromised___env__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `.env` file, potentially through a compromised development machine, insecure storage, or accidental commit to version control. Foreman's functionality of loading environment variables from this file makes it a direct target. The attacker could then extract sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
* **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of application infrastructure, financial loss, reputational damage.
* **Affected Foreman Component:** Environment Variable Loading (specifically the process of reading and parsing the `.env` file).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Never commit `.env` files to version control systems. Use `.gitignore`.
    * Implement strict access controls on development machines and file systems where `.env` files are stored.
    * Consider using more secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or environment variable injection from orchestration tools for production environments.
    * Regularly audit the storage locations of `.env` files.
    * Educate developers on the risks of exposing sensitive information.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised `Procfile`](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised__procfile_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `Procfile` and injects malicious commands or alters the execution path of processes. Foreman's core function of reading and executing commands from the `Procfile` directly facilitates this attack. Upon Foreman starting or restarting, these malicious commands will be executed with the privileges of the user running Foreman.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potential takeover of the application server, data manipulation, denial of service, installation of malware.
* **Affected Foreman Component:** `Procfile` Parsing and Process Spawning (the component responsible for reading the `Procfile` and executing the defined commands).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Restrict write access to the `Procfile` to authorized personnel and processes only.
    * Implement code review processes for changes to the `Procfile`.
    * Consider using configuration management tools to manage and deploy the `Procfile` securely.
    * Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to the `Procfile`.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Incorrect Process User Configuration](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_incorrect_process_user_configuration.md)

**Description:** The `Procfile`, a core Foreman configuration file, might be configured to run processes with unnecessarily elevated privileges (e.g., running as root). Foreman's process spawning functionality will then execute these processes with those elevated privileges. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in such a process could then gain those elevated privileges.
* **Impact:** Full system compromise, ability to access and modify any data, installation of malicious software, complete control over the server.
* **Affected Foreman Component:** Process Spawning (specifically the part that handles user specification for process execution based on the `Procfile`).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure processes are run with the minimum necessary permissions.
    * Explicitly specify the user to run each process as in the `Procfile` using user directives if available in the execution environment.
    * Regularly review the user configurations in the `Procfile`.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Uncontrolled Process Spawning](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_uncontrolled_process_spawning.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the application or manipulate the environment to cause Foreman, through its process management capabilities, to spawn an excessive number of processes, consuming system resources (CPU, memory) and leading to a denial of service.
* **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, server instability, potential financial loss due to downtime.
* **Affected Foreman Component:** Process Management and Spawning (the core functionality of Foreman responsible for starting and managing processes).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement rate limiting and resource constraints within the application to prevent excessive process creation.
    * Monitor resource usage of Foreman-managed processes.
    * Implement safeguards to prevent infinite loops or runaway processes within the application logic.
    * Configure system-level resource limits (e.g., using `ulimit`).
