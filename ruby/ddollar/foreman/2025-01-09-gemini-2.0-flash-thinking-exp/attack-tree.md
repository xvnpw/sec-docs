## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Foreman [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_foreman__critical_.md)

**Attacker's Goal:** To successfully compromise the application by leveraging weaknesses in Foreman. This is the ultimate objective and therefore critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Procfile Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_procfile_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the Procfile, which dictates the commands Foreman executes, is a direct way to influence the application's behavior. Success here often leads to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Introducing commands into the Procfile that are not intended by the application developers, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code alongside the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Procfile Directly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_procfile_directly__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining direct access to the filesystem where the Procfile resides and editing it to include malicious commands.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (if file integrity monitoring is in place)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Deployment Process Updating Procfile [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_deployment_process_updating_procfile__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the automated deployment pipeline that updates the Procfile, allowing the attacker to inject malicious content during the deployment process.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (depends on deployment logging)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Environment Variable Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_environment_variable_handling__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting how Foreman and the application handle environment variables, which can contain sensitive information or influence application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Environment Variables [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_environment_variables__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Injecting malicious code into environment variables that the application or Foreman might interpret and execute, potentially leading to command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify .env File Directly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/modify__env_file_directly__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining direct access to the `.env` file and modifying it to inject malicious code or overwrite critical variables.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (if file integrity monitoring is in place)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Deployment Pipeline Setting Env Vars [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_deployment_pipeline_setting_env_vars__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the deployment pipeline that sets environment variables, allowing the attacker to inject malicious values during deployment.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (depends on deployment logging)

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information via Environment Variables [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_via_environment_variables__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in environment variables, such as API keys or database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access .env File with Improper Permissions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access__env_file_with_improper_permissions__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigured file permissions on the `.env` file to gain unauthorized access to its contents.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (basic file permission checks)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Foreman Itself [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_foreman_itself__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities directly within the Foreman application code. Successful exploitation can compromise Foreman itself, impacting all managed processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection in Foreman's Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_in_foreman's_code__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in Foreman's code where unsanitized user input is used to construct system commands, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Foreman [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_foreman__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries (Ruby Gems) that Foreman relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in Ruby Gems [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_ruby_gems__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting known security vulnerabilities present in the Ruby Gems used by Foreman.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The specific action of finding and utilizing existing exploits for vulnerabilities in Foreman's dependencies.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (vulnerability scanning)
