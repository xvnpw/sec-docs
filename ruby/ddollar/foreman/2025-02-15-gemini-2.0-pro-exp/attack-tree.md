## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Procfile/Environment](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_procfileenvironment.md)

*   **1.1 Gain Access to Procfile/Environment [!] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker obtains unauthorized access to the `Procfile` and/or `.env` files, which define the processes and environment variables managed by Foreman. This is the prerequisite for the most dangerous attacks.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Compromised Git Repository:** Gaining access to the application's source code repository (e.g., through stolen credentials, misconfigured access controls, or a compromised developer workstation).
        *   **Insecure CI/CD Pipeline:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., weak service account credentials, exposed secrets, or insecure pipeline configurations) to access or modify these files.
        *   **Shared Configuration Files:** Accessing improperly secured shared configuration files (e.g., on a network share or in a shared development environment) that contain the `Procfile` or `.env` contents.
        *   **Server Compromise:** Gaining direct access to the server where the application is running (e.g., through a web application vulnerability, SSH brute-forcing, or other means) and accessing the files directly.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **1.2 Modify Procfile to Run Arbitrary Commands [!] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** After gaining access to the `Procfile`, the attacker modifies it to execute arbitrary commands when Foreman starts or restarts the associated process. This gives the attacker direct control over the application and potentially the host.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Replacing legitimate commands with malicious ones (e.g., changing `web: bundle exec rails server` to `web: /bin/bash -c "malicious_command"`).
        *   Adding new processes to the `Procfile` that execute malicious commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Once 1.1 is achieved)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **1.3 Inject Malicious Commands via .env [!] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the `.env` file to inject malicious commands or manipulate environment variables in a way that leads to command injection or other vulnerabilities within the application.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Adding new environment variables that are used insecurely by the application (e.g., constructing shell commands without proper sanitization).
        *   Modifying existing environment variables to contain malicious values.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Supply Malicious Input to Application (Leading to 1.2 or 1.3)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_supply_malicious_input_to_application__leading_to_1_2_or_1_3_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker provides malicious input to the web application. This input, due to a vulnerability in the application, is then used to modify the `Procfile` or `.env` file. This is an indirect attack, relying on a pre-existing application vulnerability.
    * **Methods:**
        *   Exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the application where user input is used to construct shell commands that modify the `Procfile` or `.env`.
        *   Exploiting a file inclusion vulnerability where user input can specify a file path, allowing the attacker to include a malicious `Procfile` or `.env`.
        *   Exploiting any other application vulnerability that allows the attacker to influence the content of these configuration files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
