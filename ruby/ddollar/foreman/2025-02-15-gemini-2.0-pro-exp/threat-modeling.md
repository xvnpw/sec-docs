# Threat Model Analysis for ddollar/foreman

## Threat: [Procfile Injection](./threats/procfile_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** `Procfile` Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the `Procfile` modifies it to execute arbitrary commands. The attacker adds a new process type or alters an existing one, specifying a malicious script or binary to be run by Foreman. This leverages Foreman's core functionality of executing commands defined in the `Procfile`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains code execution with the privileges of the user running Foreman. This can lead to data theft, data destruction, malware installation, or further network attacks.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:** Foreman's `Procfile` parsing and process execution logic. Specifically, the functions responsible for reading the `Procfile`, interpreting its contents, and spawning child processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Filesystem Permissions:** Enforce strict filesystem permissions on the `Procfile`. Only the application user (and *never* root) should have write access.
        *   **Version Control & Code Review:** Use version control (e.g., Git) and require code reviews for *all* changes to the `Procfile`.
        *   **Read-Only Filesystem:** If feasible, mount the application directory (including the `Procfile`) as read-only in production.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the `Procfile` for unexpected changes.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Manipulation (Leading to Indirect Code Execution via Foreman)](./threats/environment_variable_manipulation__leading_to_indirect_code_execution_via_foreman_.md)

*   **Threat:** Environment Variable Manipulation (Leading to Indirect Code Execution via Foreman)

    *   **Description:**  While environment variable manipulation *itself* isn't solely a Foreman issue, if an application uses environment variables unsafely *within commands executed by Foreman*, this becomes a Foreman-specific threat. An attacker modifies environment variables loaded by Foreman (from `.env` files or command-line arguments) to inject malicious values that are then used *within a command defined in the `Procfile`*.  For example, if the `Procfile` contains `web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT`, and the attacker can control `$PORT` to be something like `3000; malicious_command`, this becomes a Foreman-specific injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Foreman, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The impact is similar to `Procfile` injection, but the attack vector is through environment variables used *within* the `Procfile` commands.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:** Foreman's environment loading mechanism *in conjunction with* its process execution logic. The vulnerability arises from how Foreman combines environment variables with the commands defined in the `Procfile`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on how environment variables are used in `Procfile` commands)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secrets Management:** **Never store secrets in `.env` files or command-line arguments.** Use a dedicated secrets management solution.
        *   **`.env` File Protection:** If using `.env` files, ensure they are *not* committed to version control and have strict filesystem permissions.
        *   **Application-Level Sanitization:**  **Crucially, within the application code and *especially* within the `Procfile` commands, *never* directly use environment variables in shell commands or other potentially unsafe contexts without rigorous sanitization and validation.**  Treat environment variables as untrusted input.  Use parameterized commands or shell escaping functions to prevent injection.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Review both environment variables and `Procfile` commands for potential injection vulnerabilities.
