            *   **Inject Data Exfiltration Payloads (1.1.1.2.1.3):** Modifying API responses in cassettes to include code that exfiltrates sensitive data when the application processes the replayed response. This could involve modifying JSON responses to include JavaScript that sends data to an attacker-controlled server.
            *   **Inject Logic Flaws (1.1.1.2.1.4):** Manipulating responses to bypass application logic, authentication checks, or authorization mechanisms. For example, changing a response to always return "success" or "admin: true" regardless of the actual backend outcome.
            *   **Inject XSS Payloads in Responses (1.1.1.2.1.1 - Lower Risk in VCR context, but possible if application renders replayed content):** Injecting JavaScript code into response bodies that could be executed in a user's browser if the application improperly handles or renders replayed content.
            *   **Inject Malicious Redirects (1.1.1.2.1.2 - Lower Risk in VCR context, but possible if application blindly follows redirects):** Modifying responses to include redirects to attacker-controlled malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1.2 Exploit Misconfigured Storage Permissions (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_2_exploit_misconfigured_storage_permissions__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **World-Readable Cassette Directory:** Cassette storage directory is configured with world-readable permissions, allowing any user on the system (or potentially via web server misconfiguration, publicly accessible) to read and potentially modify cassettes.
    *   **Group-Readable Cassette Directory:** Cassette storage directory is readable by a group that the attacker's account belongs to (e.g., due to compromised web server user or shared hosting environment).
    *   **Overly Permissive Shared Storage Permissions:** If cassettes are stored in shared storage (e.g., network share, cloud storage), misconfigured permissions allow unauthorized access from outside the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2.1 Inject Malicious Responses (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_1_inject_malicious_responses__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Directly Editing Cassette Files:** Using a text editor or script to open cassette files (e.g., YAML files) and manually modify the response bodies, headers, or status codes.
    *   **Scripted Cassette Modification:** Writing scripts to programmatically parse and modify cassette files, allowing for automated injection of malicious payloads across multiple cassettes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2.1.3 Inject Data Exfiltration Payloads (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_1_3_inject_data_exfiltration_payloads__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Modifying API Responses to Include Exfiltration Code:** Injecting JavaScript or other client-side scripting code into replayed API responses that, when processed by the application's frontend, will send sensitive data (e.g., user tokens, application data) to an attacker-controlled endpoint.
    *   **Manipulating Response Data to Trigger Data Leakage in Application Logic:** Altering data within replayed responses in a way that causes the application's backend logic to inadvertently leak sensitive information through logs, error messages, or other channels accessible to the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2.1.4 Inject Logic Flaws (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_1_4_inject_logic_flaws__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Bypassing Authentication:** Modifying responses to simulate successful authentication even when the actual backend authentication would fail. This could involve changing status codes, response bodies containing authentication tokens, or session identifiers.
    *   **Bypassing Authorization:** Manipulating responses to grant unauthorized access to resources or functionalities. For example, changing responses to indicate that a user has administrator privileges when they should not.
    *   **Altering Application Workflow:** Modifying responses to change the expected flow of the application, potentially leading to unintended actions or states. For example, manipulating responses in a multi-step process to skip steps or force the application into an unexpected branch of logic.
    *   **Exploiting Race Conditions or Timing Issues:** Crafting responses with specific delays or content to exploit race conditions or timing vulnerabilities in the application's logic when it processes replayed responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit VCR Configuration Weaknesses (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_vcr_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Cassette Storage Location (1.2.1):**
        *   **Cassettes Stored in Publicly Accessible Web Directory (1.2.1.1):** Placing the cassette storage directory within the web server's document root, making cassettes directly accessible via HTTP requests.
    *   **Overly Permissive Match Rules (1.2.2 - Lower Risk, but can amplify other issues):** Configuring VCR to use very broad match rules that could lead to unintended cassette replays for requests that were not originally intended to be mocked.
    *   **Insecure Configuration Management (1.2.3 - Lower Risk, but can lead to configuration manipulation):** Storing VCR configuration files with overly permissive permissions or loading configuration from untrusted sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Insecure Cassette Storage Location (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_insecure_cassette_storage_location__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct HTTP Access to Cassettes:** If cassettes are stored in a publicly accessible web directory, attackers can directly download cassette files via HTTP requests, potentially revealing sensitive data or allowing for offline modification and re-upload (if write access is also possible).
    *   **Information Disclosure via Directory Listing:** If directory listing is enabled for the cassette storage directory, attackers can easily browse and identify cassette files to download.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1 Cassettes Stored in Publicly Accessible Web Directory (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_cassettes_stored_in_publicly_accessible_web_directory__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Accidental Placement in Public Directory:** Developers mistakenly placing the cassette directory within the web server's document root during development or deployment.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Web Server:** Web server configuration inadvertently exposing the cassette directory as a public directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Vulnerable YAML Deserialization (Critical Node, Potentially High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_vulnerable_yaml_deserialization__critical_node__potentially_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inject Malicious YAML Payloads in Cassettes (1.3.1.1):**
        *   **YAML Deserialization Exploits:** Crafting malicious YAML payloads within cassette files that, when deserialized by the application (if it directly deserializes cassette content), can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other deserialization vulnerabilities. This is relevant if the application directly processes or deserializes the YAML cassette files beyond just VCR's internal usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1 Inject Malicious YAML Payloads in Cassettes (Critical Node, Potentially High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1_inject_malicious_yaml_payloads_in_cassettes__critical_node__potentially_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **YAML Tags for Code Execution:** Utilizing YAML-specific tags (e.g., `!!python/object/apply:os.system`) that, when deserialized by vulnerable YAML libraries, can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
    *   **Object Instantiation Exploits:** Crafting YAML payloads that instantiate malicious objects during deserialization, leading to code execution or other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Information Disclosure via Cassettes (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_information_disclosure_via_cassettes__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Accidental Recording of Secrets:** Developers forgetting to use VCR's filtering mechanisms or not being aware of sensitive data being transmitted during recording sessions.
    *   **Lack of Awareness of PII:** Developers not recognizing certain data as PII and failing to redact it before recording cassettes.
    *   **Intentional Recording for Debugging (Bad Practice):** Developers intentionally recording sensitive data in cassettes for debugging purposes, without considering the security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1.1 API Keys, Passwords, Secrets Recorded in Cassettes (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_1_api_keys__passwords__secrets_recorded_in_cassettes__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Hardcoded Secrets in Tests:** Tests that directly use hardcoded API keys or passwords, which are then recorded into cassettes.

    *   **Secrets in Configuration Files Used During Recording:** Secrets present in configuration files that are accessed or transmitted during the recording process and captured in cassettes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1.2 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Recorded in Cassettes (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_2_personally_identifiable_information__pii__recorded_in_cassettes__critical_node__high-risk_pa_4276adce.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Recording Real User Data in Development/Staging:** Using real user data in development or staging environments for testing, which then gets recorded into cassettes.
    *   **Lack of Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Failing to properly anonymize or pseudonymize PII before recording cassettes, leading to the storage of sensitive user data in plain text.
