# Attack Surface Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Recordings](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** Critical risk of unintentionally recording and exposing highly sensitive data within VCR cassette recordings, leading to severe security breaches.
*   **How VCR Contributes:** VCR's core function of recording all HTTP interactions, including request/response bodies and headers, directly leads to this attack surface. If not configured carefully, VCR will indiscriminately capture sensitive data present in these interactions.
*   **Example:** During testing, VCR records API calls to a payment gateway. The responses contain unmasked credit card numbers or full Social Security Numbers due to a backend misconfiguration or lack of proper data masking. These recordings are then inadvertently committed to a public repository or accessible to unauthorized personnel.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** data breach, severe privacy violation, financial fraud, identity theft, significant reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and Comprehensive Data Filtering:** Implement **mandatory** and **comprehensive** `filter_sensitive_data` configurations. Go beyond basic filtering and proactively identify and redact all potentially sensitive data categories (API keys, passwords, PII, financial data, tokens, session IDs, etc.) in both requests and responses.
    *   **Secure Cassette Storage and Access Control:** Enforce strict access control to VCR cassette storage locations. Store cassettes in private repositories or secure storage systems. Regularly audit access logs. **Never commit cassettes containing potentially sensitive data to public repositories.**
    *   **Automated Sensitive Data Detection in Recordings:** Implement automated tools or scripts to scan VCR cassettes for patterns of sensitive data (e.g., regular expressions for credit card numbers, API key formats) as part of the development pipeline. Flag or reject commits containing unredacted sensitive information.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Recording Practices:** Conduct regular security audits specifically focused on VCR recording practices and configurations. Review filtering rules, storage locations, and developer workflows to ensure robust sensitive data handling.

## Attack Surface: [Cassette File Manipulation and Injection for Critical Functionality Bypass](./attack_surfaces/cassette_file_manipulation_and_injection_for_critical_functionality_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** High risk of attackers manipulating VCR cassette files to inject fabricated responses that critically bypass security controls or application logic, leading to significant security vulnerabilities.
*   **How VCR Contributes:** VCR's reliance on external, modifiable cassette files as the source of truth for HTTP interactions creates this attack surface. If these files are compromised, VCR will faithfully replay malicious responses, deceiving the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the cassette directory on a staging or pre-production server. They modify a cassette used for authentication testing to always return a successful authentication response, regardless of the actual credentials. This allows them to bypass authentication in the application when tests are run or, in a misconfigured scenario, even in a live-like environment if `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` is enabled and cassettes are relied upon.
*   **Impact:** **High** security bypass, unauthorized access to critical application features and data, potential for privilege escalation, data manipulation, and further system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File System Access Control and Isolation:** Implement the most restrictive file system permissions possible for VCR cassette directories. Isolate cassette storage from potentially compromised areas.
    *   **Read-Only Cassette Storage in Staging/Pre-production:** In staging, pre-production, or any environment resembling production, configure cassette storage to be **read-only** to prevent any modification after deployment.
    *   **Integrity Verification of Cassettes (Checksums/Signatures):** For critical applications, implement a system to verify the integrity of VCR cassettes before use. This could involve checksums or digital signatures to detect tampering.
    *   **Treat Cassettes as Untrusted Input:** Even with VCR, design application logic to **never fully trust** the data received from external services (even mocked ones). Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data processed, regardless of whether it originates from a real service or a VCR cassette. This principle of least trust is crucial.

## Attack Surface: [Critical Misconfiguration: `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` Enabled in Non-Testing Environments](./attack_surfaces/critical_misconfiguration__allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette__enabled_in_non-testing_environme_82b29c78.md)

*   **Description:** High to Critical risk arising from enabling the `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` VCR configuration option in non-testing environments (staging, pre-production, or mistakenly in production). This bypasses VCR's intended mocking behavior and can lead to severe unintended consequences.
*   **How VCR Contributes:** This specific VCR configuration setting directly controls whether real HTTP requests are allowed when a cassette is not found. Misusing this setting in the wrong environment defeats the purpose of VCR and introduces significant risks.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally enables `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` in a staging environment configuration. During automated deployments or even manual testing in staging, if cassettes are missing or incomplete, the application will make real HTTP requests to external services. This could trigger unintended actions on live external systems (e.g., real payments, sending production emails), cause data corruption in external services, or expose sensitive staging data through real network requests. In a catastrophic scenario, if mistakenly enabled in production, it could completely undermine VCR's purpose and lead to unpredictable and potentially damaging interactions with external services.
*   **Impact:** **High to Critical** - Unintended actions on external systems, data corruption, exposure of sensitive data, unpredictable application behavior in non-testing environments, potential financial loss or service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the environment and the nature of external service interactions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment-Specific Configuration Management:** Implement robust environment-specific configuration management to strictly control VCR settings. **Ensure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` is ALWAYS disabled in non-testing environments (staging, pre-production, production).**
    *   **Configuration Validation and Auditing:** Implement automated validation checks to verify that `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` is disabled in non-testing environments. Regularly audit VCR configurations across all environments.
    *   **Clear Environment Variable or Configuration Naming Conventions:** Use clear and distinct naming conventions for environment variables or configuration files to prevent accidental misconfiguration between environments (e.g., `VCR_ALLOW_HTTP_CONNECTIONS_IN_TEST_ENV_ONLY`).
    *   **Infrastructure-as-Code and Configuration Drift Detection:** Utilize Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices and configuration drift detection tools to ensure consistent and intended VCR configurations are deployed and maintained across all environments, preventing accidental or unauthorized changes.
