# Threat Model Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_cassettes.md)

*   **Description:** VCR's cassette recording functionality can inadvertently capture sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII, business data) within HTTP interactions. If these cassette files are not properly secured, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to this sensitive information. This exposure can occur through various means, such as public version control repositories, insecure storage locations, or unauthorized file system access.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Exposure of sensitive data can lead to severe consequences including account compromise, data theft, regulatory penalties, and significant reputational damage for the application and organization.
    *   **VCR Component Affected:**
        *   Cassette Recording Module
        *   Data Filtering Module
        *   Cassette Storage
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory and Robust Data Filtering:** Implement and enforce strict data filtering configurations within VCR. Utilize regular expressions and custom filters to aggressively redact sensitive headers, query parameters, and request/response bodies *before* they are written to cassettes.
        *   **Automated Cassette Content Review:** Integrate automated tools or scripts into the development workflow to regularly scan generated cassette files for potential sensitive data leaks.
        *   **Secure Cassette Storage and Access Control:** Store cassette files in dedicated, secure locations with strictly enforced access controls.  Limit access to only authorized personnel and processes. Avoid default or publicly accessible storage locations.
        *   **Prohibit Committing Sensitive Cassettes to Public Repositories:** Establish clear policies and automated checks to prevent the accidental commit of cassettes containing sensitive data to public version control systems.
        *   **Environment Variable and Secure Configuration Management for Secrets:**  Strictly avoid hardcoding sensitive data in application code that could be recorded by VCR.  Mandate the use of environment variables or dedicated secure configuration management solutions for handling API keys, passwords, and other secrets.
        *   **Consider Cassette Encryption:** For applications handling highly sensitive data, evaluate and implement encryption of cassette files at rest to provide an additional layer of security.

## Threat: [Cassette Manipulation for Malicious Replay](./threats/cassette_manipulation_for_malicious_replay.md)

*   **Description:**  If an attacker gains write access to the VCR cassette storage, they can directly manipulate cassette files. This allows them to modify recorded HTTP responses or inject entirely new, crafted cassettes. When VCR replays these tampered cassettes, it can lead to the application behaving in unintended and potentially malicious ways. This manipulation could be exploited to bypass security checks, inject malicious content into the application's processing flow, or cause application errors and instability during testing or, in severe misconfiguration scenarios, even in production if VCR is mistakenly active.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise and high potential for availability disruption. Maliciously altered cassettes can undermine the reliability of tests, introduce vulnerabilities into the application by bypassing intended security logic, and potentially lead to denial of service or other severe functional failures if exploited in a production-like setting (even accidentally during testing that mimics production).
    *   **VCR Component Affected:**
        *   Cassette Storage
        *   Cassette Replay Module
        *   Request Matching Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Write Access Control to Cassette Storage:** Implement and rigorously enforce write access controls on the cassette storage directory.  Grant write access only to essential, authorized processes and users involved in test execution and cassette management.
        *   **Cassette Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of cassette files. This could involve using checksums, digital signatures, or other integrity validation techniques to detect unauthorized modifications before cassettes are replayed.
        *   **Secure Cassette Path Handling:**  Carefully review and secure code that handles cassette file paths to prevent path traversal or injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to manipulate or inject cassettes outside of intended storage locations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for VCR Processes:** Ensure that processes interacting with VCR and cassette files operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential impact of a compromise.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of VCR Integration:** Conduct periodic security audits specifically focused on the application's VCR integration to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities related to cassette storage, access control, and replay mechanisms.
