# Attack Surface Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Cassette Files](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_cassette_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain the ability to modify the recorded HTTP interactions stored in cassette files.

**How VCR Contributes:** VCR relies on these files for replaying responses. If these files are writable by an attacker, the integrity of the replayed interactions is compromised.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a cassette file to change a "payment successful" response to a "payment failed" response, potentially disrupting financial transactions during testing or even in a poorly secured environment.

**Impact:** Bypassing security checks, injecting malicious content into responses, altering application logic based on falsified data, denial of service by corrupting essential interactions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the directory where cassette files are stored, ensuring only authorized processes can write to them.
* Store cassette files in read-only locations in production or staging environments if they are used there (though generally not recommended).
* Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of cassette files before use.
* Regularly audit the permissions of cassette file directories.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Cassette Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_cassette_files.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data) is inadvertently recorded within the HTTP requests or responses stored in cassette files.

**How VCR Contributes:** VCR records the raw HTTP interactions, including headers and bodies, which can contain sensitive data if not handled carefully during recording.

**Example:** A developer records an API call that includes an API key in the request headers. This key is then stored in the cassette file and could be exposed if the file is not properly secured.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive credentials, potential data breaches, compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement request and response filtering within VCR's configuration to exclude sensitive headers, parameters, or body content from being recorded.
* Avoid recording interactions that involve sensitive data whenever possible.
* If recording sensitive data is unavoidable, encrypt the cassette files at rest.
* Regularly review cassette files for inadvertently recorded sensitive information.
* Avoid committing cassette files containing sensitive data to version control systems.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in VCR or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_vcr_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the VCR library itself or its underlying dependencies.

**How VCR Contributes:** By including VCR as a dependency, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in VCR or its dependencies.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a YAML parsing library used by VCR could be exploited if an attacker can control the content of a cassette file that is being loaded.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update VCR and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for known vulnerabilities in VCR and its dependencies.
* Follow security best practices for managing dependencies in your project.
