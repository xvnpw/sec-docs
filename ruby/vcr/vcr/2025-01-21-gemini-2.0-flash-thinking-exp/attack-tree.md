## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State/Data via VCR Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_statedata_via_vcr_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal and a critical node because successful exploitation through VCR inherently leads to manipulation of the application's state or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cassette File Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cassette_file_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers aim to directly alter the `.yml` cassette files where HTTP interactions are stored. This path is high-risk because it provides direct control over the data the application will process during replay.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Cassette Files Directly (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_cassette_files_directly__critical_node_.md)

*   This is a critical node within the "Exploit Cassette File Manipulation" path. Directly altering the files is the core action to manipulate the recorded interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Cassette Storage (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_cassette_storage__critical_node_.md)

*   This is a critical node and a prerequisite for directly modifying cassette files. Without access, the attacker cannot proceed with this high-risk path.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Storage Location/Permissions (CRITICAL NODE):** This is a critical node and the most common way to gain access to cassette storage.
        *   Default/Weak Permissions on Storage Directory:  If the directory where cassette files are stored has default or overly permissive file system permissions, it allows unauthorized access.
        *   Exposure of Storage Path (e.g., in logs, config): If the path to the cassette storage directory is inadvertently exposed in configuration files, logs, or error messages, it makes it easier for attackers to locate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Storage Location/Permissions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_storage_locationpermissions__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node and the most common way to gain access to cassette storage.
        *   Default/Weak Permissions on Storage Directory:  If the directory where cassette files are stored has default or overly permissive file system permissions, it allows unauthorized access.
        *   Exposure of Storage Path (e.g., in logs, config): If the path to the cassette storage directory is inadvertently exposed in configuration files, logs, or error messages, it makes it easier for attackers to locate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Recorded Requests (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_recorded_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Modifying the recorded requests can trick the application into sending unintended data or triggering specific code paths during replay. This path is high-risk due to the potential for direct application compromise.
    *   **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., SQLi, XSS in replayed data) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Injecting malicious payloads into request parameters that will be replayed can exploit vulnerabilities in the application's handling of this data, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., SQLi, XSS in replayed data) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads__e_g___sqli__xss_in_replayed_data___high-risk_path_.md)

Injecting malicious payloads into request parameters that will be replayed can exploit vulnerabilities in the application's handling of this data, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Recorded Responses (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_recorded_responses__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Altering the recorded responses can manipulate the application's behavior based on the replayed data. This path is high-risk due to the potential for client-side compromise and further attacks.
    *   **Inject Malicious Content (e.g., XSS, CSRF triggers) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Injecting malicious content (e.g., XSS payloads) into the response body can compromise users interacting with the application when the tampered response is replayed. This can also involve injecting CSRF triggers to force unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content (e.g., XSS, CSRF triggers) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content__e_g___xss__csrf_triggers___high-risk_path_.md)

Injecting malicious content (e.g., XSS payloads) into the response body can compromise users interacting with the application when the tampered response is replayed. This can also involve injecting CSRF triggers to force unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure via Cassette Files (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_via_cassette_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Cassette files often contain sensitive information from recorded requests and responses. This path is high-risk because it can lead to the exposure of confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Sensitive Data from Cassette Files (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/extract_sensitive_data_from_cassette_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the core action within the "Exploit Information Disclosure via Cassette Files" path. Attackers aim to retrieve sensitive information directly from the cassette files.
    *   **Access Cassette Files (CRITICAL NODE):** This is a critical node and a prerequisite for extracting sensitive data.
        *   **Exploit Insecure Storage Location/Permissions (CRITICAL NODE):** (Repeated from above) This remains a critical node as it's the primary way to gain access to the cassette files for information extraction.
    *   **Analyze Recorded Requests (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Examining the recorded request data for sensitive information.
        *   **Extract Credentials, API Keys, Tokens in Request Headers/Body (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Recorded requests may contain sensitive authentication information like credentials, API keys, or tokens in headers or the request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Cassette Files (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_cassette_files__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node and a prerequisite for extracting sensitive data.
        *   **Exploit Insecure Storage Location/Permissions (CRITICAL NODE):** (Repeated from above) This remains a critical node as it's the primary way to gain access to the cassette files for information extraction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Analyze Recorded Requests (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/analyze_recorded_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

Examining the recorded request data for sensitive information.
        *   **Extract Credentials, API Keys, Tokens in Request Headers/Body (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Recorded requests may contain sensitive authentication information like credentials, API keys, or tokens in headers or the request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Credentials, API Keys, Tokens in Request Headers/Body (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/extract_credentials__api_keys__tokens_in_request_headersbody__high-risk_path_.md)

Recorded requests may contain sensitive authentication information like credentials, API keys, or tokens in headers or the request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Recording Process Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_recording_process_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   The recording process itself can inadvertently capture sensitive information, leading to its presence in the cassette files. This path is high-risk because it can unintentionally expose sensitive data.
    *   **Capture Sensitive Data During Recording (HIGH-RISK PATH):** This is the core action within this high-risk path.
        *   **Accidental Recording of Production Credentials/Data in Development/Test (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Developers might accidentally record interactions with production systems using real credentials or sensitive data while testing or developing, leading to this sensitive information being stored in the cassettes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Capture Sensitive Data During Recording (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/capture_sensitive_data_during_recording__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the core action within this high-risk path.
