# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Filter Sensitive Data (VCR Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/filter_sensitive_data__vcr_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  List all sensitive data points potentially in HTTP interactions (headers, bodies, URLs).
2.  **Configure `filter_sensitive_data`:** In your VCR configuration (e.g., `spec_helper.rb`), use `filter_sensitive_data`. For each data point:
    *   Define a placeholder string (e.g., `<API_KEY>`).
    *   Provide a block/lambda returning the *actual* value (usually from `ENV` or a secure method).
    *   Optionally, use regular expressions for complex patterns.
3.  **Test Filters:** Write tests that *intentionally* include sensitive data and verify that cassettes contain placeholders, *not* real values. Inspect cassettes manually initially.
4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update filter configurations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage in Cassettes (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being written to cassette files.
*   **Malicious Cassette Injection (Severity: High):** Reduces the *impact* by limiting injectable sensitive information.

**Impact:**
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: Very High (primary defense).
*   **Malicious Cassette Injection:** Risk reduction: Moderate.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `spec/support/vcr.rb` has `filter_sensitive_data` for `API_KEY` and `AUTH_TOKEN` (using environment variables). Tests in `spec/vcr_filters_spec.rb` verify.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Missing filters for PII (email, phone) in response bodies (need regex filters).
*   No regular review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable VCR for Security Tests (`VCR.turned_off`)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_vcr_for_security_tests___vcr_turned_off__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Security-Critical Tests:** Find tests verifying security mechanisms (rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, token expiration, etc.).
2.  **Use `VCR.turned_off`:** Wrap the code in these tests with `VCR.turned_off` to force interaction with the *real* API.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Deterministic Replay Leading to Security Bypass (Severity: High):** Ensures security mechanisms are tested against the real API.

**Impact:**
*   **Deterministic Replay:** Risk reduction: Very High (primary defense).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `spec/requests/rate_limiting_spec.rb` uses `VCR.turned_off`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Tests for CAPTCHA and token expiration need updating to use `VCR.turned_off`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Re-record Cassettes (VCR Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_re-record_cassettes__vcr_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish a Policy:** Define when to re-record (time-based, event-based).
2.  **Use `re_record_interval` (Optional):** Configure `re_record_interval` to auto-re-record after a time. Be mindful of flakiness.
3.  **`record: :new_episodes` (For API Changes):** Use `record: :new_episodes` to record new interactions while replaying existing ones.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Outdated Cassettes Leading to False Positives/Negatives (Severity: Medium):** Keeps cassettes up-to-date.

**Impact:**
*   **Outdated Cassettes:** Risk reduction: High.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `re_record_interval` is set to 14 days.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No formal policy for event-based re-recording.
*   No mechanism for manual re-recording (outside of deleting cassettes).
*   No API change log monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Scrubbing (Advanced VCR Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/request_scrubbing__advanced_vcr_usage_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Identify Deeply Sensitive Data:** Determine if any data is so sensitive that even `filter_sensitive_data` is insufficient (e.g., data that shouldn't even *reach* VCR).
2. **Create Custom Request Scrubbers:** Write custom Ruby code that intercepts and modifies the request *before* VCR records it. This can involve:
   *  Modifying request headers.
   *  Altering the request body (e.g., removing specific fields, encrypting data).
   *  Changing the request URL.
3. **Integrate with VCR:** Use VCR's `before_record` hook to register your custom request scrubber. This hook is called *before* VCR records any interaction.
   ```ruby
   VCR.configure do |c|
     c.before_record do |i|
       # i is the interaction object (request and response)
       i.request.body = scrub_sensitive_data(i.request.body) # Example
     end
   end
   ```
4. **Thorough Testing:**  Extensively test your request scrubbers to ensure they correctly modify requests without introducing unintended side effects.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Sensitive Data Leakage in Cassettes (Severity: High):** Provides an even stronger guarantee than `filter_sensitive_data` by preventing sensitive data from ever reaching VCR.
* **Malicious Cassette Injection (Severity: High):** Further reduces the impact by limiting what an attacker could inject.

**Impact:**
* **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: Very High (strongest defense).
* **Malicious Cassette Injection:** Risk reduction: Moderate.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
* This entire strategy is missing. It requires careful design and implementation.
