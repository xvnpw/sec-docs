# Attack Surface Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_cassettes.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or malicious exposure of sensitive information (API keys, tokens, PII, etc.) stored within VCR cassette files.
    *   **How VCR Contributes:** VCR records *all* HTTP request and response data, including sensitive information, unless explicitly filtered. This is the core mechanism of VCR, making it a direct contributor.
    *   **Example:** A developer forgets to filter an `Authorization` header containing a bearer token, and the cassette file is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of API accounts.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Data breaches and regulatory violations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Filtering:** Use VCR's `filter_headers`, `filter_query_parameters`, `filter_post_data_parameters`, and custom `before_record` hooks to *proactively* redact or replace sensitive data with placeholders *before* it's written to the cassette. This is the *primary* defense and is directly related to VCR's functionality.
        *   **.gitignore:** Add cassette files to `.gitignore` (or equivalent) to prevent accidental commits to version control.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store cassettes in a secure location with restricted access.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review cassette files.
        *   **Ephemeral Cassettes:** Use temporary directories for cassettes.
        *   **Encryption:** Encrypt cassettes at rest.

## Attack Surface: [Cassette Tampering (Poisoning)](./attack_surfaces/cassette_tampering__poisoning_.md)

*   **Description:** Modification of cassette files by an attacker to alter the application's behavior during testing or, if misused, in production-like environments.
    *   **How VCR Contributes:** VCR replays the *exact* content of the cassette file. This is a fundamental aspect of VCR's operation. If the file is altered, the application receives manipulated data, directly due to VCR's replay mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to a cassette file and modifies the response to simulate a successful login, bypassing authentication checks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassing security controls (authentication, authorization).
        *   Triggering unexpected code paths and vulnerabilities.
        *   Data corruption or manipulation.
        *   Introduction of malicious code execution (if the manipulated response triggers a vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Critical if cassettes are used in production-like environments)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Read-Only Cassettes:** Ensure cassettes are read-only.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums or digital signatures to verify cassette integrity before use, directly interacting with how VCR loads and uses the cassette.
        *   **Restricted Access:** Limit write access to cassette files.
        *   **Avoid Production Use:** *Strongly* discourage VCR in production.
