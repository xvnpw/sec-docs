## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Cassette Data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_cassette_data.md)

*   **Modify Existing Cassette**

    *   **Gain Access to Cassette Files [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** The attacker obtains unauthorized access to the files where VCR stores recorded HTTP interactions (cassettes).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Implement strict file system permissions.
            *   Store cassettes outside of the webroot.
            *   Use the principle of least privilege.
            *   Regularly audit file system permissions.

    *   **Tamper with Serialization [CRITICAL]**
        *   **YAML Deserialization Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**:
            *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious YAML code into a cassette file, which is then executed when VCR loads the cassette, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   Use `YAML.safe_load` or a safer serialization format (e.g., JSON).
                *   Implement input validation for deserialized data.
                *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

        *   **Insecure Deserialization of Untrusted Data [CRITICAL]**:
            *   **Description:** Similar to the YAML vulnerability, but applies to other serialization formats.  The attacker exploits a lack of input validation during deserialization to execute arbitrary code.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   Use secure deserialization libraries and practices.
                *   Implement strict input validation for all deserialized data.
                *   Regularly update dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data__critical_.md)

*   **Accidentally Recorded Data [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens, PII) is inadvertently recorded in VCR cassettes during normal application operation or testing.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement comprehensive data filtering using VCR's `filter_sensitive_data`, `before_record`, and `before_playback` hooks.
        *   Regularly audit cassette files for sensitive data.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of recording sensitive data.
        *   Use automated tools to scan for potential secrets in code and configuration files.

*   **Secrets Stored in Repo [HIGH RISK]**:
    *   **Description:** Cassette files containing sensitive data are accidentally committed to the source code repository (e.g., Git), making them publicly accessible or accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Add cassette directories to `.gitignore`.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of committing sensitive data.
        *   Use pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets before committing.
        *   Use automated tools to scan the repository for sensitive data.
        *   Implement a secrets management solution.
