# Threat Model Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_cassettes.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to VCR cassette files that were accidentally committed to a public or improperly secured repository, shared via insecure channels (e.g., email, unencrypted storage), or left accessible on a compromised development machine. The attacker then extracts sensitive information like API keys, passwords, session tokens, PII, or internal system details from the recorded HTTP requests and responses.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of accounts and services accessed via the exposed credentials.
        *   Data breaches and potential legal/regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   Reputational damage to the organization.
        *   Financial losses due to fraud or service disruption.
    *   **VCR Component Affected:**
        *   `VCR::Cassette`: The core class responsible for storing and retrieving recorded interactions.
        *   File system: Where the cassette files (typically YAML or JSON) are stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Record Filtering (Essential):** Use VCR's `before_record` hook and `filter_sensitive_data` configuration to *proactively* replace sensitive data with placeholders *before* it's written to the cassette.  This should be the *primary* defense.  Use regular expressions and custom logic to handle various data formats.
        *   **`.gitignore` (Essential):**  Ensure the cassette directory is *always* listed in `.gitignore` (or equivalent) to prevent accidental commits to version control.
        *   **Automated Secret Scanning (Essential):** Integrate tools like `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`, or GitHub's secret scanning into pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines to detect and block commits containing potential secrets.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store cassettes in a dedicated, access-controlled directory, separate from source code.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews should specifically check for proper filtering and `.gitignore` configuration.
        *   **Ephemeral Credentials/Mock Services (Ideal):** Design tests to use temporary, dynamically generated credentials or mock services, eliminating the need to record real sensitive data.
        *   **Regular Cassette Audits:** Periodically review existing cassettes for any missed sensitive data and scrub them.

## Threat: [Cassette Tampering for Malicious Input](./threats/cassette_tampering_for_malicious_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Cassette Tampering for Malicious Input

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the VCR cassette files (e.g., through a compromised development machine or a misconfigured shared storage). They modify the recorded responses to inject malicious payloads, alter expected data, or bypass security checks that rely on external service responses. This could lead to the application behaving unexpectedly during testing, potentially masking vulnerabilities or creating false positives.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Tests may pass even when the application has vulnerabilities, leading to insecure code being deployed.
        *   The application may behave unpredictably during testing, making debugging difficult.
        *   Security controls that rely on external services may be bypassed during testing.
    *   **VCR Component Affected:**
        *   `VCR::Cassette`: The class responsible for loading and playing back recorded interactions.
        *   File system: Where the cassette files are stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Read-Only Mode (Primary):** Configure VCR to use cassettes in read-only mode (`:once` or `:none` record modes) whenever possible. This prevents VCR from overwriting existing cassettes.
        *   **Cassette Integrity Checks (Strong):** Implement a custom solution to generate and verify checksums (e.g., SHA-256) of cassette files before loading them. This would detect any unauthorized modifications.  This is *not* a built-in VCR feature.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict write access to the cassette directory to only authorized developers and build systems.
        *   **Version Control (with Extreme Caution):**  *Only if* cassettes are thoroughly sanitized and contain *no* sensitive data, consider version control as a way to track changes and revert to previous versions. This is a *last resort* and requires extreme care.
