## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using VCR Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_vcr_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Directly alter the content of VCR cassette files to inject malicious responses.
*   **Directly Modify Cassette File:**
    *   **Gain unauthorized access to the filesystem [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's deployment environment (e.g., exposed file shares, compromised servers), or through compromised developer machines.
        *   **Impact:** The application will replay the modified responses, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
*   **Replace Cassette File:**
    *   **Gain unauthorized access to the filesystem [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **How:** Same as "Directly Modify Cassette File."
        *   **Impact:** Same as "Directly Modify Cassette File."
*   **Inject Malicious Cassette File:**
    *   **Exploit file upload vulnerabilities or insecure file storage:**
        *   **How:** Exploiting file upload vulnerabilities in the application itself (if it allows file uploads to the cassette directory), or through insecure file storage mechanisms.
        *   **Impact:** If the application can be tricked into loading these malicious cassettes, it will replay their contents.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trick Application into Using Malicious Cassettes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/trick_application_into_using_malicious_cassettes__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Force the application to load and replay malicious cassette files instead of legitimate ones.
*   **Path Traversal [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exploit insufficient input validation on cassette path:**
        *   **How:** Manipulating API parameters, environment variables, or configuration settings that influence cassette loading.
        *   **Impact:** The application might load a pre-crafted malicious cassette, leading to predictable and exploitable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit VCR Logic Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vcr_logic_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Leverage inherent weaknesses in VCR's core functionality to manipulate replayed interactions.
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable):**
    *   **Inject malicious payloads within cassette data:**
        *   **How:** Crafting malicious YAML or JSON payloads within the cassette files.
        *   **Impact:** Potentially allows for remote code execution on the application server.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Application trusts cassette content without verification:**
        *   **How:** Directly modifying cassette files as described earlier.
        *   **Impact:** The application operates on potentially compromised data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of VCR [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_vcr__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Target vulnerabilities in the libraries that VCR itself relies upon.
*   **Vulnerabilities in libraries used by VCR (e.g., YAML parsing):**
    *   **Trigger vulnerabilities in underlying libraries through crafted cassette content:**
        *   **How:** Creating cassette files that exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries like PyYAML (for Python VCR).
        *   **Impact:** Potentially leads to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
