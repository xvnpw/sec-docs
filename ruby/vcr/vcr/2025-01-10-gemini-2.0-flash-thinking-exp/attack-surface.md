# Attack Surface Analysis for vcr/vcr

## Attack Surface: [Cassette File Tampering](./attack_surfaces/cassette_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the cassette files and modifies their content.
*   **How VCR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** VCR stores recorded HTTP interactions in these files, making them a target for manipulation to influence application behavior.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a cassette file to change the response from an authentication server, allowing them to bypass login checks in subsequent test runs or, if improperly used in production, live scenarios.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, bypassing security controls, introducing vulnerabilities through crafted responses, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict write access to cassette directories and files to only necessary users/processes.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   Store cassettes in secure locations with appropriate permissions.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data in cassettes if possible, or redact it properly.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Cassette Files](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_cassette_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information present in HTTP requests and responses stored in cassette files is exposed to unauthorized individuals.
*   **How VCR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** VCR captures the raw HTTP traffic, including headers and bodies, which can contain sensitive data.
*   **Example:** Cassette files contain API keys, authentication tokens, or PII within request headers or response bodies, which are then accessible if the files are stored in a public repository or insecure location.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, personal data, or internal system details, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust filtering and redaction of sensitive data before storing cassettes.
    *   Store cassette files in secure locations with restricted access.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive data in cassettes to version control systems.
    *   Regularly review cassette files for inadvertently stored sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing VCR in Production (Accidental or Intentional)](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_vcr_in_production__accidental_or_intentional_.md)

*   **Description:** VCR, intended for testing, is inadvertently or intentionally used in a production environment.
*   **How VCR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** VCR's purpose is to mock external interactions. Using it in production means real external calls might be replaced with recorded responses, leading to incorrect behavior or security issues.
*   **Example:**  A configuration error or malicious intent leads to VCR being active in production, causing the application to use outdated or incorrect responses instead of making live API calls, potentially leading to data inconsistencies or failed transactions.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, data corruption, bypassing of critical external checks, potential security vulnerabilities due to reliance on mocked data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Clearly separate testing and production environments and configurations.
    *   Implement checks to ensure VCR is disabled in production deployments.
    *   Use environment variables or configuration flags to control VCR activation.
    *   Educate developers about the intended use of VCR and the risks of using it in production.
