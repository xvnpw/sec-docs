## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Route Hijacking/Spoofing**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Send crafted request to an unintended endpoint due to ambiguous or poorly defined routes.
    *   **Explanation:** Ambiguous route definitions can lead to a request being routed to a different handler than intended. For example, if two routes have overlapping patterns, a carefully crafted request might match the less secure one.
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Path Traversal via Route Parameters**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulate route parameters to access unauthorized resources or actions.
    *   **Explanation:** If route parameters are not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Parameter Handling Issues](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_parameter_handling_issues.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Mass Assignment Vulnerability**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inject unexpected parameters to modify internal application state or data.
    *   **Explanation:** If the application directly uses request parameters to update internal objects without proper filtering, attackers can inject unexpected parameters to modify unintended attributes.
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious code (e.g., XSS) through unvalidated parameters.
    *   **Explanation:** If parameters are not validated and sanitized before being used, attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for XSS) that gets executed in the context of other users' browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (Grape Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__grape_specific_.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Authentication Middleware**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Find weaknesses in custom authentication middleware implementations within Grape.
    *   **Explanation:** If the application uses custom authentication middleware within Grape, vulnerabilities in its implementation can allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Authorization Bypass via Route-Specific Configuration**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit misconfigurations in `requires_scope` or similar authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Explanation:** Grape allows configuring authorization rules at the route level (e.g., using `requires_scope`). Misconfigurations in these rules can lead to attackers accessing resources or actions they are not authorized to perform.
