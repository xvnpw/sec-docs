# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Threat: [Ambiguous Route Definitions](./threats/ambiguous_route_definitions.md)

*   **Threat:** Ambiguous Route Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft specific URLs that match multiple defined routes due to overlapping or poorly constrained route definitions within **Grape's routing mechanism**. This might lead to unintended handlers being executed, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing sensitive functionality meant for a different endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended code paths, potential data manipulation or disclosure.
    *   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::API` routing mechanism, specifically the `route` and related methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with clear and non-overlapping patterns using **Grape's routing DSL**.
        *   Use specific constraints on route parameters (e.g., data types, regular expressions) within **Grape's route definitions** to disambiguate routes.
        *   Carefully review route definitions for potential ambiguities during development and code reviews.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_internal_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Internal Endpoints
    *   **Description:** An attacker could discover and access internal or administrative endpoints that were unintentionally exposed through **Grape's routing**. This could grant them access to sensitive functionality or data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform administrative actions, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::API` routing mechanism, specifically the definition and mounting of API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document the intended public API surface when defining **Grape APIs**.
        *   Use separate **Grape APIs** or namespaces for internal and external endpoints.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all endpoints, especially internal ones, within **Grape handlers or middleware**.
        *   Regularly review the mounted API structure to identify any unintended exposures.

## Threat: [Parameter Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/parameter_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Parameter Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or commands through request parameters if the application fails to properly sanitize and validate input received through **Grape's parameter handling**. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server or within the database.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
