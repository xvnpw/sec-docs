# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/parameter_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the libraries Grape uses to parse request parameters (e.g., JSON, XML). Maliciously crafted input can trigger errors, denial-of-service, or even code execution in the parsing library.
    *   **How Grape Contributes:** Grape automatically handles parameter parsing based on the `Content-Type` header, making the application reliant on the security of these underlying parsing libraries. Developers might not be directly interacting with the parsing logic, potentially overlooking vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Sending a deeply nested JSON payload that exploits a vulnerability in the JSON parsing library, leading to excessive resource consumption and a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution (depending on the parser vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the underlying parsing libraries (e.g., `json`, `nokogiri`) updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using alternative, more secure parsing libraries if available and suitable.
        *   Implement input size limits to prevent excessively large payloads.
        *   Sanitize and validate parsed data before further processing, even if the parser itself is considered secure.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing the validation rules defined in Grape's `params` block, allowing invalid or malicious data to be processed by the application logic.
    *   **How Grape Contributes:** Grape provides a convenient way to define validation rules, but developers might make mistakes in defining these rules, leading to gaps or logic errors that can be exploited. Insufficient or incorrect validation logic is a direct consequence of how Grape encourages input handling.
    *   **Example:**  A validation rule for an email address that can be bypassed by including specific characters or exceeding length limits not properly checked. This could lead to the creation of accounts with invalid email addresses.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, business logic errors, potential security vulnerabilities depending on how the invalid data is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation using Grape's `params` block with type constraints, regular expressions, and custom validation logic.
        *   Thoroughly test validation rules with various valid and invalid inputs, including boundary cases and edge cases.
        *   Consider using schema validation libraries (e.g., `dry-validation`) for more complex validation scenarios.
        *   Apply validation at multiple layers if necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication Schemes](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_schemes.md)

*   **Description:** Implementing weak or flawed authentication mechanisms within Grape endpoints, allowing unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **How Grape Contributes:** While Grape doesn't enforce a specific authentication method, it provides the flexibility to implement custom authentication logic within endpoints or through middleware. Developers might implement insecure methods if not careful.
    *   **Example:** Implementing basic authentication over HTTP without HTTPS, exposing credentials in transit. Or using a weak token generation algorithm that can be easily cracked.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of HTTPS for all API endpoints to protect credentials in transit.
        *   Utilize established and secure authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
        *   Store passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
        *   Implement proper session management and token revocation mechanisms.
        *   Avoid implementing custom authentication logic unless absolutely necessary and with thorough security review.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing the authorization checks implemented within Grape endpoints, allowing users to access resources or perform actions they are not permitted to.
    *   **How Grape Contributes:** Authorization logic is often implemented within Grape endpoints or through middleware. Errors in this logic, or missing checks, can lead to vulnerabilities. The flexibility of Grape allows for various authorization implementations, increasing the potential for mistakes.
    *   **Example:**  A user with a "viewer" role being able to access endpoints intended only for "admin" users due to a missing or incorrect authorization check in the Grape endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or execution of privileged actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in Grape endpoints or through dedicated authorization middleware.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) for managing permissions.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization logic with different user roles and permissions.
        *   Ensure that authorization checks are performed consistently across all relevant endpoints.
