# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization using Grape Validators](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_using_grape_validators.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization using Grape Validators
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define expected parameters for each Grape endpoint using the `params` block.**  Within your Grape resource or endpoint definition, use the `params do ... end` block to declare all expected input parameters.
    2.  **Utilize Grape's built-in validators within the `params` block.** For each parameter, apply relevant validators such as `requires`, `optional`, `types`, `values`, `length`, and `format`.  For example:
        ```ruby
        params do
          requires :id, type: Integer, desc: 'User ID'
          optional :name, type: String, length: { maximum: 100 }, desc: 'User Name'
          optional :status, type: String, values: ['active', 'inactive'], desc: 'User Status'
        end
        ```
    3.  **Implement custom validators for complex or application-specific validation logic.** If Grape's built-in validators are insufficient, create custom validator classes that inherit from `Grape::Validations::Validators::Base` and use them within your `params` block.
    4.  **Ensure all API endpoints have comprehensive `params` blocks with appropriate validators.** Review your Grape API code to confirm that every endpoint that accepts user input has a well-defined `params` block with thorough validation rules.
    5.  **Test your Grape API endpoints with various valid and invalid inputs to verify validator effectiveness.** Write unit tests that specifically target input validation to ensure that validators are working as expected and rejecting invalid data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.)** - Severity: High. Grape validators help prevent malicious input from reaching backend systems.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Severity: Medium to High (depending on context).  Validation can prevent some forms of XSS by restricting input formats.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via oversized inputs** - Severity: Medium. `length` validators can limit input size.
    *   **Application Logic Errors** - Severity: Medium. Validators ensure data conforms to expected types and formats, reducing logic errors.

*   **Impact:** High. Significantly reduces risks associated with invalid or malicious input by leveraging Grape's validation framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Project Specific*. Look for `params do ... end` blocks within your Grape API resource files (`app/api` or similar). Check if validators are used extensively within these blocks.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Project Specific*. Areas to check:
    *   Endpoints lacking `params` blocks or with minimal validation.
    *   Complex parameters without custom validators where needed.
    *   Inconsistent validation across different endpoints.
    *   Lack of unit tests specifically for input validation in Grape endpoints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication and Authorization using Grape Helpers and Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication_and_authorization_using_grape_helpers_and_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Authentication and Authorization using Grape Helpers and Middleware
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement authentication logic within Grape helpers.** Create reusable helper methods in your Grape API (using `helpers do ... end`) to encapsulate authentication logic (e.g., verifying JWT tokens, checking API keys, session validation).
    2.  **Use Grape's `before` filters to apply authentication checks to endpoints.**  Utilize `before` filters in your Grape resources or endpoints to execute authentication helpers before processing requests. This ensures authentication is enforced for protected endpoints. Example:
        ```ruby
        before do
          authenticate! # Your authentication helper
        end
        ```
    3.  **Implement authorization logic within Grape helpers or directly in endpoints.** Create helpers or use inline code within endpoints to perform authorization checks based on user roles, permissions, or resource ownership.
    4.  **Apply authorization checks after successful authentication in your Grape endpoints.** After verifying user identity through authentication, ensure that authorization checks are performed to control access to specific resources and actions.
    5.  **Leverage Grape's middleware for broader authentication or authorization concerns (if applicable).** For more complex or cross-cutting authentication/authorization requirements, consider using Rack middleware within your Grape application to handle these aspects before requests reach your Grape endpoints.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access** - Severity: High. Grape helpers and filters enforce authentication and authorization, preventing unauthorized access to API endpoints.
    *   **Data Breaches** - Severity: High. By controlling access, these mechanisms reduce the risk of data breaches.
    *   **Privilege Escalation** - Severity: High. Authorization logic within Grape prevents users from performing actions they are not permitted to.
    *   **Data Manipulation** - Severity: High. Authorization ensures only authorized users can modify or delete data through the API.

*   **Impact:** High. Grape's helpers and filters provide a structured way to implement and enforce authentication and authorization within your API.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Project Specific*. Look for `helpers do ... end` blocks and `before` filters in your Grape API files. Check for authentication-related helper methods and how they are used in `before` filters.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Project Specific*. Areas to check:
    *   Endpoints lacking `before` filters for authentication.
    *   Insufficient or missing authorization checks within endpoints or helpers.
    *   Inconsistent authentication/authorization implementation across different parts of the API.
    *   Authentication logic not encapsulated in reusable Grape helpers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Versioning using Grape's Versioning Feature](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_versioning_using_grape's_versioning_feature.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure API Versioning using Grape's Versioning Feature
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Grape's `version` option to manage API versions.**  Define API versions at the API class level or resource level using the `version` option. Grape supports path-based, header-based, and parameter-based versioning. Example:
        ```ruby
        module API
          class Users < Grape::API
            version 'v1', using: :path # or :header, :param
            format :json
            # ... endpoints for v1 ...
          end

          class UsersV2 < Grape::API
            version 'v2', using: :path
            format :json
            # ... endpoints for v2 ...
          end
        end
        ```
    2.  **Apply security patches to all supported Grape API versions.** When security vulnerabilities are found, ensure patches are applied to all actively maintained versions defined using Grape's `version` feature.
    3.  **Deprecate and remove older Grape API versions according to a defined policy.** Use your versioning policy to deprecate and eventually remove older versions managed by Grape's versioning, reducing the maintenance burden and security risks of outdated code.
    4.  **Clearly document versioning in API documentation generated by `grape-swagger` (if used).** Ensure your API documentation, especially if generated by `grape-swagger`, clearly indicates the available API versions and how to access them, reflecting the versioning scheme defined in Grape.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation in Outdated Versions** - Severity: High. Grape's versioning helps manage different versions, allowing for patching of older versions and eventual deprecation to reduce vulnerability risks.
    *   **Security Debt Accumulation** - Severity: Medium.  By managing versions and deprecating old ones, Grape's versioning helps control security debt.

*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Grape's built-in versioning provides a framework for managing API versions securely and mitigating risks associated with outdated API code.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Project Specific*. Check your Grape API class and resource definitions for the `version` option. See how versioning is configured (path, header, param).

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Project Specific*. Areas to check:
    *   Lack of versioning in Grape API definitions.
    *   Inconsistent versioning across different API resources.
    *   Not applying security patches to older Grape API versions.
    *   No clear deprecation policy for older Grape API versions.
    *   API documentation not reflecting Grape's versioning scheme.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Error Handling using Grape's `rescue_from`](./mitigation_strategies/proper_error_handling_using_grape's__rescue_from_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Proper Error Handling using Grape's `rescue_from`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Grape's `rescue_from` to handle exceptions within your API.** In your Grape API class, use `rescue_from` blocks to catch specific exceptions that might occur during API processing.
    2.  **Customize error responses within `rescue_from` blocks to prevent information disclosure.**  Within `rescue_from` handlers, return generic, user-friendly error messages instead of exposing detailed exception information or stack traces. Example:
        ```ruby
        rescue_from :all do |e|
          error!({ message: "Internal server error" }, 500) # Generic error
          Rails.logger.error("Unhandled exception: #{e.class} - #{e.message}\n#{e.backtrace.join("\n")}") # Log details
        end
        ```
    3.  **Log detailed error information within `rescue_from` handlers for debugging purposes.**  Inside `rescue_from` blocks, log detailed error information (exception class, message, backtrace) to server-side logs for debugging and monitoring, but ensure this information is not sent in the API response.
    4.  **Define specific `rescue_from` handlers for different exception types.**  Create handlers for common exceptions your API might encounter (e.g., `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`, validation errors) to provide more tailored error responses while still avoiding information leakage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure** - Severity: Medium to High. Grape's `rescue_from` helps prevent exposing sensitive error details in API responses.
    *   **Path Disclosure** - Severity: Low to Medium. Generic error responses avoid revealing server paths.
    *   **Database Information Leakage** - Severity: Medium.  `rescue_from` can prevent database error details from being exposed.

*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Grape's `rescue_from` mechanism is crucial for controlling error responses and preventing information leakage in API error scenarios.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Project Specific*. Look for `rescue_from` blocks in your main Grape API class definition. Check how error responses are customized within these blocks.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Project Specific*. Areas to check:
    *   Lack of `rescue_from` handlers in your Grape API.
    *   Default Grape error responses being used in production.
    *   `rescue_from` handlers not customizing error messages to be generic.
    *   Detailed error information being sent in API responses instead of being logged server-side.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Documentation Exposure with `grape-swagger` Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_documentation_exposure_with__grape-swagger__configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure API Documentation Exposure with `grape-swagger` Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Control access to `grape-swagger` documentation endpoints.** Implement authentication and authorization for accessing the `/swagger_doc` endpoint (or whichever endpoint `grape-swagger` exposes documentation on). This can be done using Grape's `before` filters or other authentication mechanisms.
    2.  **Configure `grape-swagger` to exclude sensitive endpoints or parameters from documentation.** Use `grape-swagger`'s configuration options (e.g., `hidden: true` for endpoints, or parameter-level options) to prevent sensitive API details from being included in the generated documentation.
    3.  **Review generated `grape-swagger` documentation for unintended information disclosure.** After generating documentation with `grape-swagger`, carefully review it to ensure no sensitive internal details, vulnerabilities, or confidential data structures are exposed.
    4.  **Consider hosting `grape-swagger` documentation on internal networks or behind authentication.**  For sensitive APIs, restrict access to the `grape-swagger` documentation to internal networks or require authentication even to view the documentation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Documentation** - Severity: Medium. Secure `grape-swagger` configuration prevents unintentional exposure of sensitive API details in documentation.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Documentation** - Severity: Low to Medium. Access control on `grape-swagger` endpoints prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing API documentation.

*   **Impact:** Medium. Secure configuration of `grape-swagger` helps control access to and content of API documentation, reducing information disclosure risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Project Specific*. Check your Grape API initialization or configuration for `grape-swagger` setup. See if access control is implemented for `/swagger_doc` and if any configuration options are used to control documentation content.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Project Specific*. Areas to check:
    *   Publicly accessible `/swagger_doc` endpoint without authentication.
    *   Sensitive endpoints or parameters included in `grape-swagger` documentation.
    *   Lack of configuration options used to control `grape-swagger` output.
    *   No review process for generated `grape-swagger` documentation to identify potential information leaks.
