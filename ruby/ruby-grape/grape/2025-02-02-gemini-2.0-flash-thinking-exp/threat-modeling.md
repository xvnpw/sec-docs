# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Threat: [Insufficient Parameter Validation](./threats/insufficient_parameter_validation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sends malicious or unexpected input through API parameters. This can be achieved by crafting requests with invalid data types, exceeding length limits, or injecting malicious code within parameter values. For example, an attacker might inject SQL code into a parameter intended for a database query or shell commands into a parameter used in system calls.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized access, command execution on the server, denial of service, application crashes.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `params` block, `requires`, `optional`, validators (`type`, `length`, `regexp`, `values`, custom validators).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly define parameter types and validations using Grape's DSL.
        *   Utilize all relevant validators provided by Grape (`type`, `length`, `regexp`, `values`).
        *   Implement custom validators for complex validation logic.
        *   Sanitize and escape parameter values before using them in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations.
        *   Consider using a schema validation library in conjunction with Grape for more robust input validation.

## Threat: [Type Coercion Exploitation](./threats/type_coercion_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker leverages Grape's automatic type coercion to bypass validation or cause unexpected behavior. For example, an attacker might send a string that, when coerced to an integer, results in a value that bypasses intended checks or leads to logic errors.
    *   **Impact:** Logic errors, unexpected application behavior, potential bypass of security checks, data manipulation.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Type coercion mechanism within `params` block and validators.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand Grape's type coercion rules.
        *   Be explicit about required types and validate the *coerced* values, not just the initial input type.
        *   Avoid relying solely on type coercion for security-critical validation.
        *   Use specific validators to enforce the desired data format after coercion if necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom Authentication](./threats/insecure_custom_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Developers implement custom authentication logic within Grape endpoints that is flawed or weak. This could involve using weak hashing algorithms, storing credentials insecurely, or having logical errors in the authentication process. An attacker could exploit these weaknesses to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the API.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to API resources, data breaches, account takeover.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `before` filters, helper methods used for authentication within Grape API classes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize established and secure authentication libraries and patterns (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
        *   Avoid implementing custom cryptographic functions unless absolutely necessary and with expert guidance.
        *   Use Grape's `before` filters or helper methods to centralize and enforce authentication logic consistently.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test custom authentication implementations.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Checks](./threats/insufficient_authorization_checks.md)

*   **Description:** After successful authentication, the API fails to properly authorize access to specific resources or actions. An attacker, even if authenticated, might be able to access resources they are not permitted to, such as accessing data belonging to other users or performing administrative actions without authorization. This can happen if authorization logic is missing or incorrectly implemented in Grape endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Endpoint logic within Grape API classes, authorization logic implemented in `before` filters or helper methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks in every endpoint that requires access control.
        *   Use dedicated authorization libraries or frameworks to manage roles and permissions.
        *   Define clear roles and permissions for API users.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization logic for Broken Access Control (BAC) vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Inconsistent Version Security Policies](./threats/inconsistent_version_security_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Different API versions have inconsistent security policies, such as weaker authentication or validation in older versions. An attacker might target older API versions to exploit known vulnerabilities or bypass stronger security measures implemented in newer versions, especially if older versions are still accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in older versions, bypass of security measures in newer versions, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** API versioning mechanism (`version` method in Grape), overall API configuration and security setup across versions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain consistent security policies across all supported API versions whenever possible.
        *   If security policies must differ, clearly document the differences and the reasons.
        *   Deprecate and eventually remove older, less secure API versions.
        *   Implement version validation to prevent access to unsupported or deprecated versions.
