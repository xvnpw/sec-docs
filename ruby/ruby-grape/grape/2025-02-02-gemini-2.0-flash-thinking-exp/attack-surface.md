# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious input within API parameters, processed by Grape, is injected into backend systems without proper sanitization, leading to unintended actions. Grape's parameter handling, if not paired with developer-implemented sanitization, facilitates this vulnerability.
*   **Grape Contribution:** Grape parses and makes request parameters readily available to endpoint logic. This direct access, without enforced sanitization by Grape itself, places the responsibility for injection prevention squarely on the developer.  If developers fail to sanitize parameters *after* Grape parses them, injection vulnerabilities are likely.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint defined in Grape takes a `query` parameter and uses it directly in a database query string. An attacker injects SQL code within the `query` parameter, exploiting the lack of sanitization *after* Grape's parameter parsing to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Developer Responsibility):** Developers must implement robust input sanitization and validation *within their Grape endpoint logic* after parameters are parsed by Grape. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
    *   **Output Encoding (Developer Responsibility):**  Developers must encode output data appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) if API responses are rendered in web browsers. Grape does not handle output encoding automatically.
    *   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common injection attack patterns at the network level, providing an additional layer of defense *outside* of Grape itself.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify object attributes they should not by providing unexpected parameters in API requests. Grape's simplified parameter handling and entity exposure features, if misused, can directly contribute to this vulnerability.
*   **Grape Contribution:** Grape's entity exposure and parameter binding features streamline data handling. However, if developers rely solely on Grape's default behavior without explicit parameter filtering, the framework can inadvertently facilitate mass assignment by binding request parameters to model attributes without proper access control.
*   **Example:** A Grape API endpoint uses an entity to expose and update user data. If the endpoint code doesn't explicitly define allowed parameters within the Grape `params` block, an attacker could send a request with parameters like `is_admin=true`, and Grape might bind this parameter to the `is_admin` attribute of the User model if it exists and is accessible, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Parameter Filtering (Developer Responsibility):** Developers must explicitly define and whitelist allowed parameters within the Grape `params` block for each endpoint. Use `requires` and `optional` with specific types to control accepted parameters.
    *   **Use Strong Parameter Gems (Developer Responsibility):** Integrate gems like `strong_parameters` (if not already used by the underlying framework) to enforce parameter whitelisting at the model level, adding a layer of defense *beyond* Grape's basic parameter handling.
    *   **Review Entity Exposure (Developer Responsibility):** Developers must carefully review Grape entities to ensure they only expose necessary attributes and do not inadvertently expose sensitive or modifiable attributes that should be protected from mass assignment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) via API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__via_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** API endpoints defined using Grape's routing expose direct references to internal objects (e.g., database IDs) in URLs without sufficient authorization checks *implemented by the developer*, allowing attackers to access resources they shouldn't. Grape's routing structure can make IDOR vulnerabilities easier to introduce if authorization is not a primary development focus.
*   **Grape Contribution:** Grape's routing system simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, often leading to endpoints that directly incorporate object identifiers in URLs (e.g., `/resources/:id`). While Grape provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization, it does not enforce authorization by default.  If developers fail to implement proper authorization *within their Grape endpoints*, the framework's routing structure can inadvertently expose IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A Grape endpoint is defined as `/api/items/:item_id` to retrieve item details. If the developer does not implement authorization logic *within this Grape endpoint* to verify if the requesting user is permitted to access the item with the given `item_id`, an attacker could potentially access any item by simply changing the `item_id` in the URL.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authorization Checks within Endpoints (Developer Responsibility):** Developers must implement robust authorization checks *within each relevant Grape endpoint*. Use Grape's `before` filters or dedicated authorization libraries to verify user permissions before granting access to resources based on object IDs.
    *   **Indirect Object References (Developer Consideration):** Consider using indirect object references (e.g., UUIDs, opaque tokens) instead of predictable database IDs in API URLs. While not a Grape-specific mitigation, this design choice can reduce the attack surface for IDOR vulnerabilities in APIs built with Grape.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs) (Developer Responsibility):** Implement ACLs to define granular permissions for accessing resources based on user roles and object ownership, and enforce these ACLs within Grape endpoints.
