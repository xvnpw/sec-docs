# BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business priority for adopting Grape is to efficiently and effectively develop and maintain robust RESTful APIs. This framework aims to streamline API creation in Ruby, promoting developer productivity and API consistency. Businesses choose Grape to quickly deliver API-driven products and services, enabling integration with other systems and providing interfaces for clients (web, mobile, partners).

Key business goals include:
- Rapid API development and deployment.
- Consistent and well-structured API design.
- Simplified API maintenance and evolution.
- Integration with existing Ruby-based systems.
- Support for various API functionalities (versioning, documentation, authentication, etc.).

Most important business risks to address:
- Security vulnerabilities in APIs leading to data breaches or service disruption.
- Performance bottlenecks in APIs affecting user experience and system scalability.
- API design flaws causing integration issues and developer friction.
- Lack of API documentation hindering adoption and external integration.
- Dependency on the Grape framework and its community support.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Rack middleware for handling common web application security tasks (e.g., request forgery protection, session management). Implemented via Rack ecosystem and potentially custom middleware in Grape applications.
- security control: Ruby on Rails security features if Grape is used within a Rails application (e.g., parameter sanitization, content security policy). Implemented by Rails framework.
- security control: HTTPS for transport layer security. Typically configured at the web server or load balancer level.
- security control: Input validation within application logic. Implemented by developers in Grape API endpoints.
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented within Grape applications using gems like Warden, Devise, or custom solutions. Implemented by developers in Grape API endpoints and potentially Rack middleware.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on developer expertise for secure coding practices within Grape applications.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in Grape framework or its dependencies.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of underlying infrastructure (web servers, databases) leading to security weaknesses.
- accepted risk: Incomplete or inconsistent implementation of security controls across different APIs built with Grape.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Grape applications.
- security control: Introduce API gateway for centralized security controls (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, threat detection).
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies in Grape APIs.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Grape-based APIs.
- security control: Enforce secure coding guidelines and training for developers working with Grape.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: APIs must authenticate all incoming requests to verify the identity of the caller.
    - requirement: Support for industry-standard authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
    - requirement: Secure storage of API keys or credentials if used.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: APIs must authorize access to resources based on the authenticated user's roles and permissions.
    - requirement: Implement fine-grained access control to restrict access to specific API endpoints and data.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to API access.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: APIs must validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    - requirement: Use input validation libraries and frameworks to sanitize and validate user inputs.
    - requirement: Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs without revealing sensitive information.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
    - requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and key management practices.
    - requirement: Protect cryptographic keys from unauthorized access.
    - requirement: Enforce HTTPS for all API communication.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code for the Grape API and commit changes to a code repository.
2. Code Repository (e.g., GitHub): Source code is stored and version controlled in a repository like GitHub.
3. CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions): Automated CI/CD pipeline is triggered on code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Build Application: The pipeline starts by building the Grape application, resolving dependencies, and compiling code if necessary.
5. Run Tests (Unit, Integration): Automated tests (unit and integration tests) are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
6. SAST Scanning: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
7. Build Container Image: A Docker container image is built, packaging the Grape application, web server, and necessary dependencies.
8. Container Image Scanning: The container image is scanned for vulnerabilities using container image scanning tools.
9. Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry): The built and scanned container image is pushed to an artifact repository (like Docker Registry or a cloud provider's container registry).
10. Deployment System: The deployment system pulls the container image from the artifact repository and deploys it to the target environment (e.g., container orchestration service).

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Code Repository Access Control: Restrict access to the code repository to authorized developers.
- security control: Code Reviews: Implement mandatory code reviews to identify potential security flaws before code is merged.

- security control: CI/CD Pipeline Security: Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and access controls.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- API Availability: Ensuring the API is available to consumers for business operations.
- Data Integrity: Protecting the integrity of data accessed and manipulated through the API.
- Data Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access through the API.
- Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring only authorized users and applications can access specific API resources and functionalities.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User Data: Personally identifiable information (PII), user credentials. Sensitivity: High. Requires strong confidentiality and integrity protection due to privacy regulations and potential harm from breaches.
- Transaction Data: Financial transactions, order details, payment information. Sensitivity: High. Requires strong confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to financial and legal implications.
- Application Data: Business-specific data managed by the API. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the nature of the data). Requires confidentiality and integrity protection to maintain business operations and competitive advantage.
- API Keys/Secrets: Credentials used for authentication and authorization. Sensitivity: Critical. Requires extreme confidentiality protection as compromise can lead to unauthorized access to the entire API.
- Logs: Application and security logs. Sensitivity: Medium. Requires integrity and confidentiality protection to ensure auditability and prevent tampering.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of data will be handled by APIs built with Grape? (e.g., PII, financial data, application-specific data).
- What are the specific authentication and authorization requirements for these APIs?
- Are there any compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that need to be considered?
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the APIs?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards within the organization that need to be followed?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to build and deploy APIs quickly and efficiently to support business needs. Security is important but should not significantly hinder development speed.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls like HTTPS and input validation are expected to be in place. However, more advanced security measures like API gateways, automated security scanning, and centralized logging might be lacking and are recommended.
- DESIGN: APIs will be deployed in a cloud environment using containers for scalability and resilience. A managed database service and authentication service will be utilized to reduce operational overhead. The build process will be automated using CI/CD pipelines with basic security checks.
