## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Routing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_routing__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Identify vulnerable route definition [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker analyzes Grape route definitions, looking for routes that:
        *   Accept user-controlled input as part of file paths.
        *   Construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation.
        *   Use user input to directly access files or directories on the server.
*   **Crafted malicious path bypasses intended directory restrictions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Once a vulnerable route is identified, the attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..%2F`) in the route parameters.
    *   These sequences are designed to bypass intended directory restrictions and access files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially leading to:
        *   Reading sensitive configuration files.
        *   Accessing application source code.
        *   Reading arbitrary files on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Versioning on Sensitive Endpoints [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/missing_versioning_on_sensitive_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Identify sensitive endpoints lacking versioning [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker enumerates API endpoints, checking for versioning schemes (e.g., path-based, header-based).
    *   Focus is on identifying sensitive endpoints (e.g., user management, administrative functions, data modification) that are exposed without versioning.
*   **Exploit vulnerabilities in the unversioned endpoint that are fixed in later versions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Once unversioned sensitive endpoints are found, the attacker investigates known vulnerabilities in older versions of the application or the Grape framework itself.
    *   If vulnerabilities are found that are fixed in later versions but are present in the unversioned endpoint, the attacker exploits them. This can lead to:
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Privilege escalation.
        *   Remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Identify endpoints accepting user input without validation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker analyzes API endpoints and their parameters, looking for inputs that are directly used in application logic without proper validation. This includes:
        *   Route parameters.
        *   Query parameters.
        *   Request headers.
        *   Request body (JSON, XML, etc.).
*   **Inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS) through unvalidated input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Once unvalidated input points are identified, the attacker crafts malicious payloads tailored to the context of the input. Common injection types include:
        *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL queries into database interactions to bypass authentication, extract data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
        *   **Command Injection:** Injecting operating system commands into system calls to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages to be executed by other users' browsers, allowing session hijacking, defacement, or information theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inadequate Input Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inadequate_input_sanitization__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Identify endpoints with insufficient sanitization logic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker analyzes application code or observes application behavior to understand the input sanitization mechanisms in place.
    *   Focus is on identifying weaknesses or gaps in the sanitization logic, such as:
        *   Blacklisting instead of whitelisting.
        *   Incomplete or context-insensitive sanitization.
        *   Vulnerabilities in sanitization libraries or custom sanitization functions.
*   **Bypass sanitization filters with crafted payloads [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Once weaknesses in sanitization are identified, the attacker crafts payloads designed to bypass the filters. This often involves:
        *   Using encoding techniques (e.g., URL encoding, HTML encoding).
        *   Using case variations.
        *   Using alternative syntax or command structures.
        *   Exploiting logical flaws in the sanitization logic.
    *   Successful bypass leads to the same injection vulnerabilities as in "Lack of Input Validation" (SQL injection, command injection, XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Misconfigured Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_misconfigured_authentication__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Application implements custom authentication logic within Grape [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application uses custom authentication logic, which is often more prone to vulnerabilities than established, well-tested libraries.
*   **Identify weaknesses in custom authentication (e.g., insecure token generation, flawed session management) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker analyzes the custom authentication implementation, looking for common weaknesses such as:
        *   **Insecure Token Generation:** Weak or predictable token generation algorithms, insufficient entropy in tokens, or tokens that are easily guessable or brute-forceable.
        *   **Flawed Session Management:** Session fixation vulnerabilities, session hijacking vulnerabilities due to weak session IDs or insecure transmission, lack of session timeout or renewal mechanisms.
        *   **Password Storage Issues:** Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms.
        *   **Bypassable Authentication Checks:** Logical flaws in the authentication flow that allow bypassing authentication checks.
    *   Exploiting these weaknesses can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts or the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass due to Grape Middleware Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass_due_to_grape_middleware_misconfiguration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Application uses Grape middleware for authorization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application uses Grape middleware for authorization, which relies on correct configuration and order of middleware.
*   **Identify misconfigurations in middleware order or logic that allow bypassing authorization checks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker analyzes the middleware configuration and order, looking for misconfigurations that can lead to authorization bypass, such as:
        *   **Incorrect Middleware Order:** Authorization middleware placed after routing or other middleware that might bypass authorization checks.
        *   **Logical Flaws in Middleware Logic:** Errors in the authorization logic within the middleware itself, allowing unauthorized requests to pass through.
        *   **Missing Middleware on Sensitive Routes:** Authorization middleware not applied to all sensitive API endpoints, leaving them unprotected.
    *   Bypassing authorization allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to, potentially leading to data breaches or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Management (if Grape application manages sessions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_management__if_grape_application_manages_sessions___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Application manages sessions directly or through Grape extensions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application manages sessions, either directly or using Grape extensions, which introduces potential session-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploit vulnerabilities in session management (e.g., session fixation, session hijacking, weak session IDs) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attacker attempts to exploit common session management vulnerabilities:
        *   **Session Fixation:** Forcing a user to use a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session after the user authenticates.
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing a valid session ID through various means (e.g., network sniffing, XSS, malware) to impersonate the user.
        *   **Weak Session IDs:** Predictable or easily brute-forceable session IDs, allowing attackers to guess valid session IDs.
        *   **Insecure Session Storage:** Storing session data insecurely (e.g., in client-side cookies without proper protection).
        *   **Lack of Session Timeout or Renewal:** Sessions that persist indefinitely, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers to hijack them.
    *   Successful exploitation of session vulnerabilities allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
