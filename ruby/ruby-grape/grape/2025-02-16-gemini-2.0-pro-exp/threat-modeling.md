# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Threat: [Unexpected Type Coercion Leading to Logic Bypass](./threats/unexpected_type_coercion_leading_to_logic_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Unexpected Type Coercion Leading to Logic Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a string value for a parameter expected to be an integer (e.g., `"1abc"` instead of `1`).  Grape's coercion might convert this to `1`, bypassing subsequent validation checks that rely on the full input being numeric (e.g., a check for a specific range or a database query that expects a valid integer ID). The attacker might also send extremely large numbers or other unexpected types.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, unexpected application behavior, potential bypass of security checks, denial of service (if large values cause resource exhaustion).
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Type coercion mechanisms (e.g., `Integer`, `Float`, `Date`, etc. type declarations in `params` blocks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strict type declarations and `allow_blank: false` with `requires`.
        *   Implement *additional* validation *after* coercion (e.g., range checks, format checks using regular expressions).
        *   Sanitize input after coercion and validation.
        *   Use whitelisting (`values`) whenever possible.
        *   Robust error handling for coercion failures.

## Threat: [`requires` Bypass with Empty Values](./threats/_requires__bypass_with_empty_values.md)

*   **Threat:** `requires` Bypass with Empty Values

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an empty string (`""`), an empty array (`[]`), or `null` for a parameter declared with `requires`.  Without `allow_blank: false`, Grape might treat this as a valid submission, leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the application logic that assumes the parameter is present and non-empty.
    *   **Impact:** Null pointer exceptions, application crashes, data corruption, bypass of intended logic.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `requires` parameter validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use `allow_blank: false` in conjunction with `requires`.
        *   Add custom validation to explicitly check for emptiness if `allow_blank: false` is insufficient.
        *   Thorough testing with empty values for required parameters.

## Threat: [Nested Parameter Validation Bypass](./threats/nested_parameter_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Nested Parameter Validation Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request with nested parameters (e.g., a hash containing another hash).  Validation is implemented for the top-level parameters but is missing or incomplete for the nested parameters. The attacker injects malicious data into the unvalidated nested parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, injection attacks (if nested data is used in database queries or other sensitive operations), bypass of security controls.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** Nested parameter handling using `Hash` and `Array` types within `params` blocks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement recursive validation using nested `requires` and `optional` blocks within `Hash` and `Array` definitions.
        *   Create reusable helper methods or custom validators for complex nested structures.
        *   Extensive testing with various valid and invalid nested inputs.

## Threat: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass via Flawed `before` Filter](./threats/authenticationauthorization_bypass_via_flawed__before__filter.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication/Authorization Bypass via Flawed `before` Filter

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends requests to protected endpoints, exploiting weaknesses in the `before` filter logic used for authentication and authorization.  This could be due to incorrect conditional logic, failure to handle edge cases, or improper use of `route_param` for context-specific authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `before` filters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a well-established authentication library (e.g., Devise, Warden).
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege in `before` filters.
        *   Implement fine-grained, route-specific authorization using `route_param` or other context.
        *   Comprehensive testing, including negative test cases for unauthorized access.
        *   Avoid global `before` filters when possible; use more specific filters.

## Threat: [`before` Filter Override in Descendant Classes](./threats/_before__filter_override_in_descendant_classes.md)

*   **Threat:** `before` Filter Override in Descendant Classes

    *   **Description:** A base Grape API class defines `before` filters for security.  A descendant class overrides these filters, either intentionally or accidentally, weakening or removing the security checks.  An attacker exploits the weakened security in the descendant class.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to endpoints protected in the base class but not in the descendant class.
    *   **Grape Component Affected:** `before` filters and class inheritance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when overriding `before` filters in descendant classes.
        *   Understand the execution order of `before` blocks in the inheritance hierarchy.
        *   Use `super` to call parent class `before` blocks when appropriate.
        *   Thorough testing of descendant classes to ensure inherited security is maintained.
