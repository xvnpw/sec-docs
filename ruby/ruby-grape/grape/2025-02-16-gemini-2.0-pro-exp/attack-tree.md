## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Parameter Handling -> 1.1 Type Juggling [HIGH RISK] -> (If leads to SQL Injection) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_parameter_handling_-_1_1_type_juggling__high_risk__-__if_leads_to_sql_injection__{critica_cf41e01e.md)

*   **Description:** Grape's parameter coercion can be manipulated if type enforcement isn't strict. An attacker might send a data type different from what's expected (e.g., a string instead of an integer).  While Grape itself might handle the coercion, the *application logic* might not perform sufficient validation *after* Grape's processing. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the coerced value is used in security-sensitive operations like database queries, file system access, or command execution. The "critical" aspect is conditional: it becomes critical *if* the type juggling enables a vulnerability like SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An endpoint expects an integer `id` parameter: `/users/:id`.
        *   Grape is configured to coerce to an integer (`type: Integer`).
        *   An attacker sends `/users/1+OR+1=1`.
        *   Grape might coerce this to the integer `1`.
        *   If the application then uses this value directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{params[:id]}`), it results in SQL injection. The attacker effectively executes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1`, retrieving all user data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Type Validation (Beyond Grape):** Use Grape's `type` option, but *also* implement robust validation *within your application code* to check the data's format and range *after* Grape's coercion.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input, even after type coercion, before using it in any security-sensitive context.  Use parameterized queries for databases, escaping for shell commands, etc.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user has only the necessary permissions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on application logic)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Ranges from minor logic errors to complete data compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Format Parsers [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_format_parsers__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 XXE via XML {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_xxe_via_xml_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:**  If the Grape API processes XML input and the XML parser is misconfigured, it can be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.  Attackers can craft malicious XML payloads that include external entity references. These references can point to local files, internal network resources, or external URLs.  The parser, if not properly secured, will resolve these entities, potentially leading to information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service (DoS).
        *   **Example:**
            *   An attacker sends an XML payload like this:
                ```xml
                <!DOCTYPE foo [
                  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
                ]>
                <root>&xxe;</root>
                ```
            *   If the parser resolves the `xxe` entity, it will read the contents of `/etc/passwd` and potentially include it in the response, exposing sensitive system information.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Disable External Entities:** The primary mitigation is to configure the XML parser to *completely disable* the resolution of external entities and DTDs (Document Type Definitions).  For Nokogiri (Grape's default XML parser), ensure it's configured securely.  Recent versions *should* be secure by default, but *verify*.
            *   **Use a Safe XML Parser:** Ensure you are using a known-secure XML parser and that it's up-to-date.
            *   **Prefer JSON:** If possible, use JSON instead of XML for data exchange. JSON parsers are generally less susceptible to XXE-like vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If using a properly configured Nokogiri; higher if using a custom or older parser)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (File disclosure, SSRF, DoS)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 RCE via Custom Parser {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_rce_via_custom_parser_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** If the Grape API uses a *custom* parser (for a custom content type or a non-standard format), and that parser contains vulnerabilities, it could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is one of the most severe vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Example:**
            *   A custom parser uses the `eval()` function (or similar in other languages) to process user-supplied input without proper sanitization.  An attacker could inject code into the input that would be executed by `eval()`.
            *   Another example: a custom parser that uses a vulnerable library or insecurely handles system calls.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Avoid `eval()` and `system()`:** Absolutely avoid using `eval()`, `system()`, or similar functions with untrusted input.
            *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles rigorously when developing custom parsers.  Use well-vetted libraries and avoid any potentially dangerous functions.
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input *before* it reaches the custom parser.
            *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, run the custom parser in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
            *   **Extensive Testing:** Perform extensive security testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing, on any custom parser.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires a vulnerable custom parser to be present)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Deserialization Vulnerabilities {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_deserialization_vulnerabilities_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** If the Grape API uses a format that involves deserialization (e.g., YAML, Marshal, or custom serialization formats), and the deserialization process is not secure, an attacker can inject malicious objects.  When these objects are deserialized, they can trigger unintended code execution or other harmful behavior.
        *   **Example:**
            *   An API uses YAML for input and uses `YAML.load` (which is unsafe) instead of `YAML.safe_load`. An attacker could craft a YAML payload containing a malicious Ruby object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Safe Deserialization:** Use safe deserialization methods that restrict the types of objects that can be created.  For YAML, *always* use `YAML.safe_load` in Ruby.  For Marshal, avoid using it with untrusted data entirely.
            *   **Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization):** Validate the input *before* deserialization to ensure it conforms to the expected structure and doesn't contain any unexpected or potentially malicious elements.
            *   **Prefer Simpler Formats:** If possible, use simpler formats like JSON, which do not involve complex object deserialization and are therefore less prone to these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If using safe deserialization practices; higher if using unsafe methods)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4 Format String Vulnerabilities in Custom Parsers {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_4_format_string_vulnerabilities_in_custom_parsers_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to RCE via custom parsers, if a custom parser uses format string functions (like `sprintf` in C, or similar constructs in other languages) and the *format string itself* is derived from user input, it can lead to vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to read arbitrary memory locations, write to arbitrary memory locations, or potentially execute code.
        *   **Example:**
            *   A custom parser uses a function similar to `sprintf` where the format string argument is constructed based on user input. An attacker could provide a crafted format string that reads from or writes to unintended memory locations.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never Use User-Controlled Format Strings:** The format string argument to functions like `sprintf` should *never* be directly or indirectly controlled by user input.
            *   **Use Parameterized Inputs:** Use safe methods for incorporating user data into strings, such as parameterized inputs or escaping mechanisms.
            *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles when developing custom parsers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires a vulnerable custom parser)
        *   **Impact:** High (Information disclosure, potential RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
