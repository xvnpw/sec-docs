# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Attack Surface: [1. Parameter Validation Bypass (Grape-Specific Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/1__parameter_validation_bypass__grape-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumvent input validation to inject malicious data, exploiting Grape's parameter handling features.
    *   **Grape's Contribution:** Grape's DSL, automatic type coercion, nested parameter handling, and array handling create opportunities for bypass if not meticulously managed.  The ease of defining parameters *can* lead to developers overlooking crucial validations.
    *   **Example:** An endpoint expects an `Array[Integer]` for `product_ids`, but the developer only validates `type: Array` and forgets to validate the *elements* within the array. An attacker sends `["1", "2; DROP TABLE products"]`, potentially leading to SQL injection if those elements are used unsafely.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, denial of service, remote code execution (depending on how the invalid input is used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (context-dependent).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Mandatory, explicit, and granular validation:  Enforce a policy of *always* defining *complete* validation rules (`requires`, `optional`, `type`, `values`, custom validators) for *every* parameter, including *each element* within nested parameters and arrays.  Don't rely on implicit behavior.
            *   Strict type checking: Use precise type declarations (e.g., `Integer`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Array[Integer]`) and avoid relying solely on Grape's default coercion.  Validate *types* and *values*.
            *   Input sanitization: Sanitize input *after* validation, especially for strings, to remove potentially harmful characters. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
            *   `values` restriction: Use the `values` option to restrict parameters to a predefined, whitelisted set of allowed values whenever possible.
            *   Regular code reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on parameter validation completeness and correctness.
            *   Automated testing: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests that cover a wide range of input types, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and *especially* edge cases related to Grape's coercion and nested parameter handling.
            *   Schema validation (for complex cases): Consider using libraries like `dry-validation` for more robust and complex validation scenarios, particularly for deeply nested structures.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unintended Endpoint Exposure (Grape-Specific Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/2__unintended_endpoint_exposure__grape-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** Endpoints intended for internal use or specific roles are accidentally exposed due to misconfigurations in Grape's routing or versioning.
    *   **Grape's Contribution:** Grape's routing DSL and `version` feature, while powerful, require careful configuration to avoid exposing unintended endpoints.  The way Grape APIs are mounted within other frameworks (e.g., Rails) adds another layer of potential misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:** An older version of an API (`/v1/users`) is still accessible after `/v2/users` is deployed.  `/v1/users` contains a known vulnerability that was fixed in `/v2/users`.  An attacker exploits the vulnerability in `/v1/users`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Route review and auditing: Regularly and *thoroughly* review *all* defined routes (including those generated by Grape's mounting and versioning features) to ensure they are intended to be public or have the correct access controls.  Automate this process if possible.
            *   Strict authentication and authorization: Implement robust authentication and authorization *at the route level* using `before` filters or Grape's built-in authentication mechanisms.  Do *not* rely solely on application-level authentication.  Enforce a consistent authorization strategy (e.g., role-based access control).
            *   Explicit versioning strategy: Have a *clear and documented* versioning strategy.  *Explicitly* disable or remove old API versions when they are no longer supported.  Ensure that any remaining older versions are *fully* patched and secured.  Automate the decommissioning process.
            *   API documentation and inventory: Maintain accurate, up-to-date, and *easily accessible* API documentation, clearly marking which endpoints are public, private, or require specific roles.  This aids in identifying potential exposure.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Deserialization (Grape-Related Risk)](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_deserialization__grape-related_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit unsafe deserialization of data provided through Grape parameters.
    *   **Grape's Contribution:** While Grape doesn't *force* unsafe deserialization, it *facilitates* it if developers choose to deserialize data from parameters using unsafe methods (e.g., `Marshal.load` in Ruby) *without proper safeguards*. The risk arises from how developers *use* Grape, not Grape itself, but the framework's parameter handling is the entry point.
    *   **Example:** An endpoint accepts a `data` parameter and, within the endpoint's logic, the developer uses `Marshal.load(params[:data])` to deserialize the provided data. An attacker sends a crafted serialized Ruby object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Absolute avoidance of unsafe deserialization: *Never* use unsafe deserialization methods like `Marshal.load` with *any* data received from Grape parameters (or any untrusted source). This is the most important mitigation.
            *   Prefer safe serialization formats: Use safe and well-established serialization formats like JSON or YAML for data exchange. These formats are generally much less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities.
            *   Whitelisting (last resort): If, and *only* if, you absolutely *must* use a potentially unsafe deserialization method (which should be avoided), implement *extremely strict* whitelisting of the classes that are allowed to be deserialized. This is a highly complex and error-prone approach and should be considered a last resort, requiring expert security review.
