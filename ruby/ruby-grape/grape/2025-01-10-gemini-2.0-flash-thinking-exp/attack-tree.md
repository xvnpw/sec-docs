## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Grape](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_grape.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at any of the child nodes contributes to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Parameter Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_parameter_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting how the application receives and processes user input. Weaknesses here are fundamental and can lead to various exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

* Attack Vector: Send unexpected parameters in the request.
    * Description: The attacker crafts a request containing parameters that are not intended to be set by the user.
    * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on application's parameter handling).
    * Impact: High (Modify sensitive data, escalate privileges).
    * Mitigation: Use strong parameter filtering (e.g., `params do ... requires ... permit ... end`), define explicit permitted parameters, and avoid directly assigning request parameters to model attributes.
* Attack Vector: Grape's `params` object allows writing to unintended attributes.
    * Description: The `params` object in Grape, if not handled carefully, might allow writing to model attributes that should be protected.
    * Likelihood: Medium (If not explicitly prevented).
    * Impact: High (Modify sensitive data, escalate privileges).
    * Mitigation:  Use strong parameter filtering and avoid directly using the `params` object to update model attributes without proper validation and whitelisting.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inadequate Parameter Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inadequate_parameter_validation.md)

* Attack Vector: Grape's built-in validation is not used or incorrectly configured.
    * Description: Developers fail to utilize Grape's built-in validation features to enforce data integrity and security.
    * Likelihood: High (Common developer oversight).
    * Impact: High (Allows injection attacks (SQLi, XSS), data corruption, business logic bypass).
    * Mitigation:  Utilize Grape's validation DSL (`requires`, `optional`, `exactly_one_of`, etc.) to define expected data types, formats, and constraints.
* Attack Vector: Application-level validation is missing or insufficient.
    * Description: Even if Grape's validation is used, application-specific validation logic might be missing or inadequate.
    * Likelihood: High (Common developer oversight).
    * Impact: High (Allows injection attacks (SQLi, XSS), data corruption, business logic bypass).
    * Mitigation: Implement comprehensive validation logic within the application layer, beyond Grape's basic validation, to enforce business rules and data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure via Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_via_error_messages.md)

* Attack Vector: Trigger application errors that expose sensitive information in the response.
    * Description: Attackers intentionally trigger errors to elicit responses containing sensitive information like stack traces, internal paths, or database details.
    * Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration).
    * Impact: Medium (Leak sensitive data, aid in further attacks).
    * Mitigation: Implement custom error handling that logs detailed errors securely on the server-side but returns generic, non-revealing error messages to the client in production environments.
* Attack Vector: Grape's default error handling reveals internal details.
    * Description: Grape's default error handling might expose sensitive information if not overridden.
    * Likelihood: Medium.
    * Impact: Medium (Leak sensitive data, aid in further attacks).
    * Mitigation: Configure Grape to use a custom error formatter that prevents the disclosure of sensitive information in error responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Internal Logic or Extensions (Middleware, Formatters)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_internal_logic_or_extensions__middleware__formatters_.md)

* This node represents risks associated with custom code integrated into the Grape application, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not developed securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

* Attack Vector: Application uses custom middleware with security flaws.
    * Description: Custom middleware, responsible for tasks like authentication, authorization, or request modification, contains security vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on middleware complexity and review).
    * Impact: High (Varies depending on the middleware's function, e.g., authentication bypass, data manipulation, code execution).
    * Mitigation:  Thoroughly review and test custom middleware code for security vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices, perform static and dynamic analysis, and consider security audits.
* Attack Vector: Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the middleware's logic.
    * Description: Attackers craft requests to specifically target and exploit flaws in the custom middleware.
    * Likelihood: Medium.
    * Impact: High (Varies depending on the middleware's function).
    * Mitigation: Implement robust security measures within the middleware, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling. Ensure the middleware correctly enforces security policies.
