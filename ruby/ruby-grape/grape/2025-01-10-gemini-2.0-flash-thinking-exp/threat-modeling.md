# Threat Model Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities Through Permissive Parameter Whitelisting](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_through_permissive_parameter_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially modify internal application attributes by including them in the API request if the parameter whitelisting, managed by Grape's `requires` and `optional` directives, is too broad. This allows manipulation of data that should not be directly accessible through the API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of application data, potential privilege escalation if internal roles or permissions are modifiable through the API.
*   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::Request#params` (how parameters are filtered based on `requires` and `optional`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Practice the principle of least privilege when defining allowed parameters within `requires` and `optional` blocks. Only allow the necessary attributes to be modified through the API.
    *   Regularly review and update parameter whitelists defined in your Grape API definitions to ensure they remain secure as the application evolves.
    *   Consider using separate data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models to explicitly define the data accepted by the API, further isolating internal application models from direct manipulation through Grape parameters.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Endpoints or Functionality Through Incorrect Routing](./threats/exposure_of_internal_endpoints_or_functionality_through_incorrect_routing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might discover and access internal or administrative endpoints if the routing configuration within Grape is not properly secured. This happens when routes are defined in a way that unintentionally exposes functionality intended for internal use to external users.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, potential for system compromise or data breaches depending on the exposed functionality.
*   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::API#route`, `Grape::Namespace`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Organize your API endpoints logically using Grape's `namespace` feature to clearly separate public and internal APIs.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using Grape's `before` filters or integrated libraries to restrict access to sensitive endpoints defined within specific namespaces or routes.
    *   Carefully review your routing configuration within your Grape API definitions to identify and remove any unintentionally exposed endpoints.
    *   Consider mounting internal APIs under specific paths with stricter access controls, potentially even in separate Grape applications.

## Threat: [Improper Authentication and Authorization Handling within Grape Filters](./threats/improper_authentication_and_authorization_handling_within_grape_filters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could bypass authentication or authorization checks if the `before` filters or custom authentication/authorization logic within your Grape API are implemented incorrectly or have vulnerabilities. This could involve flaws in how Grape's `before` filters are used to validate tokens, sessions, or user roles.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, potential data breaches, ability to perform actions as other users.
*   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::API#before`, custom authentication/authorization helpers or middleware integrated with Grape.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use established and well-vetted authentication and authorization libraries or patterns within your Grape application, leveraging Grape's integration points.
    *   Ensure authentication and authorization logic is applied consistently across all protected API endpoints using `before` filters or similar mechanisms within your Grape API definitions.
    *   Thoroughly test your authentication and authorization implementation within your Grape application for bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid implementing custom authentication schemes directly within Grape filters unless absolutely necessary and with thorough security review. Securely handle authentication tokens and credentials within the context of your Grape application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities Introduced by Malicious or Poorly Implemented Custom Middleware](./threats/vulnerabilities_introduced_by_malicious_or_poorly_implemented_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom middleware added to the Grape request pipeline using `use`. If this middleware, which interacts directly with Grape's request handling, has security flaws, it can compromise the entire API.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Grape Component:** `Grape::API#use`, custom middleware classes integrated into the Grape application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware integrated into your Grape application for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware that interacts with Grape's request lifecycle.
    *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to middleware functionality, ensuring it only has the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks within the Grape application.
