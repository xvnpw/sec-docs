# Attack Surface Analysis for ruby-grape/grape

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify object attributes they shouldn't have access to by including unexpected parameters in the request.

**How Grape Contributes:** Grape's `params` hash provides direct access to all submitted parameters. If this hash is directly used to update model attributes without proper filtering or whitelisting, it becomes vulnerable to mass assignment.

**Example:** A user updating their profile sends a request with `admin=true` along with their name and email. If the backend directly uses `User.update(params)` without checking, the user's admin status could be elevated.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized access to administrative functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Strong Parameters: Implement mechanisms like `strong_parameters` (from Rails or similar libraries) to explicitly define and whitelist allowed parameters within the Grape endpoint logic.
*   Sanitize Input:  Carefully filter and sanitize the `params` hash before using it to update model attributes.
*   Use Dedicated Update Methods:  Create specific methods in your models that only accept the necessary attributes for updates.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure or Overly Permissive Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_or_overly_permissive_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** Poorly defined route patterns can lead to unintended route matching, exposing functionality or data that should be restricted.

**How Grape Contributes:** Grape's DSL for defining routes, while powerful, requires careful attention to detail. Ambiguous or overly broad route patterns can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Defining a route like `/users/:id` without proper constraints on `:id` could allow access to resources beyond numerical user IDs if the application doesn't strictly validate the input.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, information disclosure, potential for unintended actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Specific Route Constraints: Utilize Grape's route constraints (e.g., `requires :id, type: Integer`) to restrict the types of values accepted in route parameters.
*   Avoid Overlapping Routes: Carefully design your routes to avoid ambiguity and ensure that each endpoint serves a specific purpose.
*   Review Route Definitions Regularly: Periodically review your Grape API definitions to identify and correct any overly permissive or insecure route patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Checks within Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_checks_within_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Failing to properly authorize requests within Grape endpoints can allow users to perform actions they are not permitted to.

**How Grape Contributes:** While Grape provides mechanisms for authentication, the responsibility for implementing and enforcing authorization logic within the endpoints lies with the developer using Grape's structure.

**Example:** An API endpoint for deleting user accounts doesn't check if the requesting user has the necessary administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, access to sensitive functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Authorization Middleware: Use Grape's middleware capabilities to implement authorization checks before the main endpoint logic is executed.
*   Leverage Authorization Libraries: Integrate with established authorization libraries like Pundit or CanCanCan to manage permissions.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended actions.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage through Serialization](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_through_serialization.md)

**Description:** Serializers might inadvertently expose sensitive data in API responses that should not be public.

**How Grape Contributes:** Grape's built-in support for different representation formats (e.g., JSON, XML) relies on serializers. If these serializers are not configured carefully, they can expose internal attributes or relationships.

**Example:** A user serializer might include the user's password hash or internal database IDs in the API response.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for account compromise or further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly Define Serializer Attributes:  Carefully define the attributes to be included in the serialized output.
*   Use Different Serializers for Different Contexts: Create different serializers for different API endpoints or user roles to control the level of detail exposed.
*   Regularly Review Serializer Configurations: Periodically review your serializer definitions to ensure they are not inadvertently exposing sensitive information.
