## Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in `simple_form` Application

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced or facilitated by the `simple_form` gem.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via simple_form
    * HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities
        * Bypass Client-Side Validations
            * Manipulate HTML attributes
        * HIGH-RISK PATH: CRITICAL Inject Malicious Input
            * HIGH-RISK PATH: CRITICAL Inject Scripting Code (XSS)
            * HIGH-RISK PATH: CRITICAL Inject SQL Injection payloads
            * CRITICAL Inject Command Injection payloads
        * HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
            * Submit unexpected or protected attributes

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**

* **Attack Vector:** This path represents the attacker targeting weaknesses in how the application processes user input received through forms generated by `simple_form`.
* **Steps:**
    * **Bypass Client-Side Validations:**
        * **Attack:** The attacker manipulates HTML attributes (e.g., `required`, `pattern`) in the browser's developer tools to circumvent client-side validation rules.
        * **Likelihood:** High
        * **Impact:** Low (Directly, but enables further attacks)
        * **Effort:** Low
        * **Skill Level:** Low
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
    * **CRITICAL Inject Malicious Input:** This node represents the core of several high-risk scenarios where the attacker successfully injects malicious code or commands.

**High-Risk Path: CRITICAL Inject Malicious Input -> CRITICAL Inject Scripting Code (XSS)**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into form fields. When this data is displayed by the application (e.g., in labels, error messages, or other parts of the UI), the script executes in the victim's browser.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**High-Risk Path: CRITICAL Inject Malicious Input -> CRITICAL Inject SQL Injection payloads**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL code within form fields. If the application uses this input directly in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, the attacker can manipulate the database.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

**CRITICAL Node: Inject Malicious Input -> CRITICAL Inject Command Injection payloads**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious operating system commands into form fields. If the application uses this input in system calls without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Medium to High
    * **Skill Level:** High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker submits unexpected or protected model attributes through the form data. If the application's models are not properly protected against mass assignment, the attacker can modify sensitive data or escalate privileges.
* **Steps:**
    * **Submit unexpected or protected attributes:**
        * **Attack:** The attacker includes additional or protected attribute names and values in the form submission.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium to High
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Medium
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
