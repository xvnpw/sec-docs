# Threat Model Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Provider Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_provider_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to the application's server or codebase and retrieve stored API keys, secrets, or other credentials used to communicate with authentication providers. This is directly related to how the application configures OmniAuth using the `provider` method.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can impersonate the application with the provider, potentially accessing user data associated with the application on the provider's side, or performing actions on behalf of the application. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:** Configuration (specifically how the `provider` method is used in `OmniAuth::Builder` or initializer blocks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) *instead of directly in OmniAuth configuration files*.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or configuration files that are directly used by OmniAuth.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Callback URLs leading to Authorization Code Theft](./threats/misconfigured_callback_urls_leading_to_authorization_code_theft.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the authentication flow by tricking the user into initiating the login process through a malicious link. If the application's callback URL, as configured within OmniAuth, is not strictly validated, the attacker can redirect the authorization code to their own server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can use the intercepted authorization code to obtain an access token for the legitimate user's account on the provider, allowing them to impersonate the user and access their data or perform actions on their behalf within the application.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:** `OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2` (and similar strategies), specifically the callback URL configuration within the strategy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly define and validate callback URLs in the OmniAuth provider configuration.
        *   Avoid using wildcard subdomains or overly broad patterns in callback URL configurations within OmniAuth.

## Threat: [Open Redirect Vulnerability in OmniAuth or Provider Strategy](./threats/open_redirect_vulnerability_in_omniauth_or_provider_strategy.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked, initiates an authentication flow but redirects the user to an attacker-controlled website after the authentication process (or even before). This could be due to vulnerabilities in how OmniAuth handles redirection URLs or within the specific provider strategy implementation.
    *   **Impact:**  Users can be tricked into visiting phishing sites or downloading malware, as the redirection appears to originate from the legitimate application. This can lead to credential theft, malware infection, or other security compromises.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:** `OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2` (and similar strategies), specifically the redirection logic within the strategy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep OmniAuth and all provider strategies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully review any custom OmniAuth strategies or modifications for potential redirection issues.

## Threat: [Authorization Code Interception via Unsecured HTTP](./threats/authorization_code_interception_via_unsecured_http.md)

*   **Description:** If the callback URL, as configured for OmniAuth, is served over HTTP instead of HTTPS, an attacker on the same network could intercept the authorization code exchanged between the provider and the application.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can use the intercepted authorization code to obtain an access token and impersonate the user within the application.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:**  The entire authentication flow initiated and managed by OmniAuth, particularly the callback handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving the authentication flow, including the callback URL configured in OmniAuth.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Provider Strategies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_specific_provider_strategies.md)

*   **Description:**  Individual OmniAuth strategies for specific providers might contain implementation flaws or be outdated, leading to security vulnerabilities specific to that provider's authentication flow.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access, or potentially compromise user data. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability and the provider.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:**  Specific `OmniAuth::Strategies::[Provider]` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-maintained and actively developed OmniAuth strategies.
        *   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in specific provider implementations and their corresponding OmniAuth strategies.
        *   Consider contributing to or forking strategies if necessary to address security concerns.
        *   Regularly update OmniAuth and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Using Outdated OmniAuth Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_omniauth_version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Using an older version of the OmniAuth gem that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application is running the outdated version.
    *   **Impact:**  The application becomes susceptible to known exploits, potentially leading to authentication bypass, data breaches, or other security compromises depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected OmniAuth Component:** The entire OmniAuth gem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the OmniAuth gem and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly review security advisories for OmniAuth and its dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.
