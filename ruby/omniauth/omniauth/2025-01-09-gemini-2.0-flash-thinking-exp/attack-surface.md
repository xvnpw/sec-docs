# Attack Surface Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Attack Surface: [OAuth Misconfiguration (Redirect URI)](./attack_surfaces/oauth_misconfiguration__redirect_uri_.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured or insufficiently validated `redirect_uri` values during the OAuth flow.

**How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth relies on the developer to configure and handle the redirection process after authentication. Improper validation allows attackers to manipulate this.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `redirect_uri` parameter in the initial authentication request to point to their own malicious site. After successful authentication at the provider, the authorization code is sent to the attacker's site.

**Impact:** Authorization code theft, potentially leading to account takeover on the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a predefined whitelist on the server-side.
*   Avoid using wildcards in `redirect_uri` configurations.
*   Implement robust state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks in conjunction with redirect URI manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [OAuth Misconfiguration (Client Credentials)](./attack_surfaces/oauth_misconfiguration__client_credentials_.md)

**Description:** Exposure or insecure handling of the `client_id` and `client_secret` used to communicate with the OAuth provider.

**How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth requires these credentials to be configured for each provider. If these are compromised, the application's integration is at risk.

**Example:** `client_secret` is hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in a publicly accessible configuration file. An attacker obtains these credentials.

**Impact:**  Attacker can impersonate the application to the OAuth provider, potentially gaining access to user data or performing actions on their behalf.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store `client_id` and `client_secret` securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   Never commit secrets directly to version control.
*   Regularly rotate client secrets if the provider supports it.

## Attack Surface: [State Parameter Manipulation (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/state_parameter_manipulation__csrf_.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper implementation or validation of the `state` parameter in the OAuth flow, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**How OmniAuth Contributes:** While OmniAuth provides mechanisms for state parameter handling, developers need to correctly implement and validate it.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that initiates an OAuth flow with a manipulated `state` parameter. If the application doesn't verify the returned `state`, the attacker can potentially link their account to the victim's application account.

**Impact:** Account linking to an attacker's controlled account, potentially leading to data access or modification within the victim's application account.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `state` parameter is randomly generated and cryptographically secure.
*   Strictly validate the returned `state` parameter against the one initiated by the application.
*   Use the built-in state parameter handling features provided by OmniAuth strategies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Token Handling and Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_token_handling_and_storage.md)

**Description:**  Improper storage or handling of access tokens or refresh tokens received from the OAuth provider.

**How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth facilitates the retrieval of these tokens, but the application is responsible for their secure management after the callback.

**Example:** Access tokens are stored in browser local storage or cookies without proper encryption or HttpOnly/Secure flags. An attacker using XSS can steal these tokens.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data or resources on the provider's side.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store access and refresh tokens securely on the server-side.
*   If client-side storage is necessary, use encrypted cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags.
*   Implement proper session management and token revocation mechanisms.
*   Avoid storing sensitive tokens in logs or other easily accessible locations.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Provider Response](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_provider_response.md)

**Description:**  Failing to properly sanitize or validate user data received from the authentication provider during the callback phase.

**How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth provides the user information hash from the provider. If the application doesn't sanitize this data, it can be exploited.

**Example:** The provider returns a user's name containing malicious JavaScript code. The application renders this unsanitized name on a profile page, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data received from the OmniAuth callback before using it in the application.
*   Employ context-aware output encoding when displaying user-provided data.
