# Threat Model Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Provider Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_provider_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's configuration where sensitive provider credentials (API keys, client secrets) are stored in plain text or weakly encrypted within the OmniAuth configuration. The attacker can then use these credentials to impersonate the application with the provider.

**Impact:** The attacker can make API calls to the provider as the application, potentially accessing or modifying user data, or performing actions on behalf of the application. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and reputational damage.

**Affected OmniAuth Component:** `OmniAuth.config`, specific provider strategy configurations (e.g., within the configuration block where strategies are defined).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Store credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions *outside* of the main OmniAuth configuration files.
*   Ensure that the configuration loading mechanism for OmniAuth is secure and doesn't expose credentials.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Callback URL](./threats/misconfigured_callback_url.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the OAuth flow by providing a malicious callback URL during the initial authentication request. If the OmniAuth middleware or the application's callback handling doesn't properly validate the redirect URI, the attacker can intercept the authorization code or access token.

**Impact:** The attacker can obtain the authorization code intended for the application and exchange it for an access token, effectively hijacking the authentication process and gaining unauthorized access to the user's account within the application.

**Affected OmniAuth Component:** `OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2` (or similar strategies) within the OmniAuth middleware, specifically how it handles and validates redirect URIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure allowed callback URLs explicitly within the OmniAuth provider strategy options.
*   Ensure the application's callback route performs strict validation of the `redirect_uri` parameter if passed by the provider.

## Threat: [Missing or Improperly Validated State Parameter](./threats/missing_or_improperly_validated_state_parameter.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious authentication request to the provider and tricks a legitimate user into initiating the flow. If the OmniAuth strategy does not enforce or the application doesn't validate the `state` parameter upon the callback, the attacker can bypass CSRF protection and potentially link their account on the provider to the victim's account on the application.

**Impact:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's application account by successfully linking their provider account. This can lead to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, and account takeover.

**Affected OmniAuth Component:** `OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2` (or similar strategies), specifically the parts responsible for generating and verifying the `state` parameter.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure that the OmniAuth strategy being used automatically generates and validates the `state` parameter (most OAuth 2.0 strategies do).
*   If using a custom strategy or an older version, implement `state` parameter generation and validation.

## Threat: [Authorization Code Interception](./threats/authorization_code_interception.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the authorization code during the callback from the authentication provider to the application. While HTTPS mitigates this, vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS implementation or network can still pose a risk.

**Impact:** The attacker can use the intercepted authorization code to directly request an access token from the provider, bypassing the application's intended authentication flow and gaining unauthorized access to the user's resources.

**Affected OmniAuth Component:** Network communication handled by the underlying Ruby HTTP libraries used by `OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2` (or similar strategies) during the callback phase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure the application environment has up-to-date TLS libraries and configurations.
*   Enforce HTTPS at the infrastructure level (e.g., using HSTS headers).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OmniAuth Gem or Provider Strategies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_omniauth_gem_or_provider_strategies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the core `omniauth` gem or in specific provider strategies (e.g., `omniauth-facebook`, `omniauth-google-oauth2`). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious actions *within the OmniAuth flow*.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from authentication bypass to remote code execution within the context of the authentication process.

**Affected OmniAuth Component:** The specific version of the `omniauth` gem and the affected provider strategy gem.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update the `omniauth` gem and all provider strategy gems to the latest versions.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues related to OmniAuth.
*   Implement a process for quickly patching or mitigating discovered vulnerabilities in OmniAuth.
