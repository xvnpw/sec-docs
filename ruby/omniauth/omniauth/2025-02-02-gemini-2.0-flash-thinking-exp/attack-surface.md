# Attack Surface Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Provider Credentials Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_provider_credentials_storage.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive API keys and secrets for OAuth providers in a way that is easily accessible to attackers.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth requires configuration with provider credentials. Insecure storage directly exposes vulnerabilities related to Omniauth setup.
*   **Example:** Hardcoding provider secrets in application code or storing them in plain text configuration files within the codebase.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover at the provider level, data breaches, unauthorized actions on behalf of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize environment variables for credential storage.
        *   Employ secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Encrypt configuration files and manage decryption keys securely.
        *   Never commit secrets to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Provider Strategies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_provider_strategies.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly setting up Omniauth provider strategies, leading to unintended access or insecure authentication flows.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth's configuration directly dictates the authentication flow and requested permissions. Misconfiguration is a direct Omniauth vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Using development provider credentials in production or requesting overly broad scopes granting unnecessary data access.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data from the provider, potential for unauthorized actions due to excessive permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test provider configurations in all environments.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for OAuth scopes.
        *   Use separate provider applications and credentials for different environments.
        *   Regularly audit configured scopes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Callback URLs](./attack_surfaces/insecure_callback_urls.md)

**Description:** Using overly permissive or insecure callback URLs in provider configurations, allowing attackers to redirect the authentication flow.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth relies on callback URLs. Misconfiguration of these URLs is a direct vulnerability in the Omniauth setup.
*   **Example:** Using wildcard callback URLs or broadly defined URLs not specific to the application's callback path.
*   **Impact:** Authorization code interception, redirection attacks, potential account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly define and validate callback URLs in provider configurations.
        *   Use specific, non-wildcard URLs matching the application's callback endpoint.
        *   Implement server-side validation of the `redirect_uri` parameter.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of HTTPS for Callback URLs](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_https_for_callback_urls.md)

**Description:** Using `http://` instead of `https://` for callback URLs, exposing sensitive data in transit.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** While Omniauth doesn't enforce HTTPS, its secure use *requires* HTTPS for callbacks. HTTP callbacks are a direct misconfiguration in the context of Omniauth security.
*   **Example:** Configuring callback URLs as `http://example.com/auth/provider/callback`.
*   **Impact:** Interception of authorization codes or tokens via man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always** use `https://` for callback URLs in production.
        *   Ensure the entire application and authentication flow are over HTTPS.
        *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

## Attack Surface: [State Parameter Manipulation (CSRF and Replay Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/state_parameter_manipulation__csrf_and_replay_attacks_.md)

**Description:** Insufficient or missing validation of the `state` parameter in OAuth 2.0 flows, allowing CSRF and replay attacks.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth strategies often utilize the `state` parameter. Improper handling directly leads to vulnerabilities in the Omniauth authentication flow.
*   **Example:** Not generating or validating the `state` parameter, or using predictable state values.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, replay attacks reusing intercepted authentication responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Always implement and rigorously validate the `state` parameter.
        *   Generate cryptographically random, unpredictable `state` values.
        *   Store and verify `state` server-side upon callback.
        *   Ensure `state` uniqueness and limited lifespan.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Code Interception in Callback](./attack_surfaces/authorization_code_interception_in_callback.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in callback handling logic exposing the authorization code received from the provider.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth provides access to the authorization code in the callback. Insecure handling of this code is a direct consequence of Omniauth integration.
*   **Example:** Logging the entire callback URL (including the code) or passing the code insecurely to client-side JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Theft of the authorization code, allowing attackers to exchange it for an access token and impersonate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Handle authorization codes securely server-side only.
        *   Avoid logging callback URLs or authorization codes.
        *   Exchange the authorization code for an access token immediately.
        *   Do not expose authorization codes to client-side scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Token Theft and Session Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/token_theft_and_session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** Insecure handling and storage of access tokens or refresh tokens obtained through Omniauth.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Omniauth facilitates obtaining tokens. The application's responsibility to secure these tokens is directly tied to Omniauth's output.
*   **Example:** Storing tokens in insecure browser local storage or cookies without `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application resources, persistent access if refresh tokens are compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Store tokens securely (server-side sessions or HTTP-only, secure cookies).
        *   Use `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies storing tokens.
        *   Always transmit tokens over HTTPS.
        *   Implement token rotation and short-lived access tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Gem and Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/gem_and_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the `omniauth` gem itself or its provider strategy dependencies.
*   **Omniauth Contribution:** Using Omniauth introduces dependencies on the `omniauth` gem and strategy gems, making the application vulnerable to their flaws.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an outdated Omniauth gem or strategy gem allowing authentication bypass.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, authentication bypass, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep `omniauth` and all dependencies (strategy gems) up-to-date with security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories for `omniauth` and its ecosystem.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities.
