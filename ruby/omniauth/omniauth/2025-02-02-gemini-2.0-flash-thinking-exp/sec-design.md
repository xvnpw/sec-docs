# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository `omniauth/omniauth`, aims to provide a flexible and standardized authentication library for Ruby applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify the integration of various authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, OAuth 2.0, SAML) into Ruby web applications.
  - Provide a consistent and easy-to-use API for developers to handle authentication flows.
  - Support a wide range of authentication strategies and protocols.
  - Maintain a secure and reliable authentication process.
  - Foster a community-driven approach to expand and maintain authentication strategies.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the core library or individual authentication strategies could compromise applications using Omniauth.
  - Incompatibility with new authentication protocols or changes in provider APIs could require ongoing maintenance and updates.
  - Poorly implemented or outdated authentication strategies could introduce security weaknesses.
  - Complexity in configuration or usage could lead to developer errors and misconfigurations, resulting in security vulnerabilities.
  - Dependency on external authentication providers introduces risks related to provider availability, security, and policy changes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Ruby on Rails Security Practices - Omniauth is often used within Ruby on Rails applications, leveraging Rails' built-in security features. (Implemented within integrating applications)
  - security control: Gem Security Scanning - RubyGems ecosystem and platforms like GitHub may perform automated security scans on published gems. (Potentially implemented by RubyGems and GitHub)
  - security control: Community Review - As an open-source project, the code is subject to community review and scrutiny, which can help identify potential security issues. (Implemented by the open-source community)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Providers - Omniauth depends on external authentication providers, inheriting risks associated with their security and availability.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by Users - Developers integrating Omniauth might misconfigure it, leading to security vulnerabilities in their applications.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - Omniauth and its strategies may depend on other gems, which could have their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the Omniauth core and popular strategies by security professionals.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in Omniauth's dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
  - security control: Clear Security Documentation - Provide comprehensive security documentation for developers, including best practices for configuration and usage, and guidance on handling sensitive data.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report issues responsibly.
  - security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Maintainers - Enforce 2FA for maintainers of the repository and RubyGems package to protect against account compromise.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Securely handle authentication flows with various providers (OAuth 1.0a, OAuth 2.0, SAML, OpenID Connect, etc.).
    - requirement: Support different authentication strategies and allow developers to easily add new ones.
    - requirement: Protect against common authentication attacks such as replay attacks, session fixation, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Facilitate the retrieval of user authorization and permissions from authentication providers.
    - requirement: Allow applications to control access based on user roles or permissions obtained from providers.
    - requirement: Ensure that authorization tokens and credentials are handled securely and not exposed.

  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all inputs received from authentication providers to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - requirement: Sanitize and encode user data appropriately before storing or displaying it.
    - requirement: Handle error responses from providers gracefully and securely, avoiding information leakage.

  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use strong cryptography for handling sensitive data such as API keys, secrets, and tokens.
    - requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys and secrets.
    - requirement: Implement HTTPS for all communication involving sensitive data and authentication flows.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure authentication of users for Ruby applications.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Omniauth library.
  - Protecting the reputation and trust associated with the Omniauth project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Indirectly handles user credentials during authentication flows, although Omniauth itself does not typically store them persistently.
  - API keys and secrets for authentication providers, which are highly sensitive and must be protected from unauthorized access.
  - User data retrieved from authentication providers (e.g., email addresses, names), which may have varying levels of sensitivity depending on the provider and application context. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
  - Source code of the Omniauth library, which if compromised could lead to widespread security vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: High.
