# Threat Model Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Threat: [Authorization Code Interception/Manipulation](./threats/authorization_code_interceptionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the authorization code during the OAuth flow, potentially by eavesdropping on network traffic (if HTTPS is not enforced or compromised) or through client-side vulnerabilities. They might also attempt to manipulate the code before it reaches the application's callback endpoint to gain unauthorized access or redirect the flow.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, impersonation, potentially gaining control over the user's account within the application.
*   **OmniAuth Component Affected:** OAuth Flow, Callback Handling, potentially `omniauth-strategies` gems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication, especially the callback URL.
    *   Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` parameter in OmniAuth configuration and on the provider side if possible.
    *   Implement and validate the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF and ensure flow integrity.

## Threat: [Redirect URI Vulnerabilities (Open Redirect)](./threats/redirect_uri_vulnerabilities__open_redirect_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages insufficient validation of the `redirect_uri` parameter. They can craft a malicious authorization request with a `redirect_uri` pointing to an attacker-controlled domain. After successful (or seemingly successful) authentication, the user is redirected to the malicious site, potentially leading to phishing or malware attacks.
*   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, credential theft on the malicious site, malware distribution, account takeover if the attacker can further manipulate the flow after redirection.
*   **OmniAuth Component Affected:** OAuth Flow, `omniauth-core` (redirect URI handling), Application Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly whitelist allowed redirect URIs in OmniAuth configuration.
    *   Avoid dynamically constructing redirect URIs based on user input.
    *   If dynamic redirect URIs are necessary, implement robust validation and sanitization to prevent open redirects.

## Threat: [Token Theft or Leakage](./threats/token_theft_or_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to OAuth access tokens or refresh tokens. This could happen through insecure storage (e.g., plain text in databases or logs), logging sensitive information, client-side vulnerabilities (XSS), server-side vulnerabilities, or compromised infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and resources, data breaches, impersonation, potentially long-term access if refresh tokens are compromised, privacy violations.
*   **OmniAuth Component Affected:** Token Handling (within application code, related to data obtained via OmniAuth).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store access and refresh tokens securely. Use encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
    *   Minimize logging of sensitive information like tokens. Redact or mask tokens in logs if necessary.
    *   Implement robust token handling practices within the application.
    *   Protect against client-side vulnerabilities (XSS) that could lead to token theft.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OmniAuth Core Gem](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_omniauth_core_gem.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the core OmniAuth gem itself. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability, including authentication bypass, information disclosure, remote code execution, denial of service.
*   **OmniAuth Component Affected:** `omniauth-core` gem.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OmniAuth gem updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Ruby and OmniAuth.
    *   Regularly review and audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OmniAuth Strategy Gems](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_omniauth_strategy_gems.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in specific OmniAuth strategy gems (e.g., `omniauth-google-oauth2`, `omniauth-facebook`). These vulnerabilities could be provider-specific and exploited to compromise the authentication flow for that provider.
*   **Impact:** Provider-specific vulnerabilities, potentially leading to authentication bypass, information disclosure, or other provider-related security issues, account takeover.
*   **OmniAuth Component Affected:** `omniauth-strategies` gems, specific strategy gems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability and provider).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OmniAuth strategy gems updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   Choose well-maintained and reputable strategy gems.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to specific strategy gems.
