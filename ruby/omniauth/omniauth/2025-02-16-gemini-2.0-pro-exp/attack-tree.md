```

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing -> Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_-_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker tricks the user into visiting a fake provider login page (e.g., through a phishing email) that mimics a legitimate provider. The user enters their credentials, which are captured by the attacker. The attacker then uses these credentials to authenticate to the real provider and, subsequently, to the target application via OmniAuth.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Attacker creates a fake login page resembling a legitimate provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
        2.  Attacker sends a phishing email or creates a malicious website that links to the fake login page.
        3.  User clicks the link and is redirected to the fake login page.
        4.  User enters their credentials on the fake page.
        5.  Attacker captures the credentials.
        6.  Attacker uses the captured credentials to log in to the legitimate provider.
        7.  Attacker initiates the OmniAuth flow with the target application, using the compromised provider account.
        8.  If the application does not have additional security measures (like account linking verification), the attacker gains access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   User education about phishing attacks.
        *   Strong email security measures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
        *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the provider side (if supported).
        *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the application side.
        *   Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [DNS Spoofing -> Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/dns_spoofing_-_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker compromises a DNS server or uses other techniques (e.g., ARP poisoning) to redirect the user's request for the legitimate provider's domain to a fake server controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to present a fake login page and capture the user's credentials.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Attacker compromises a DNS server or uses network manipulation techniques.
        2.  User attempts to access the legitimate provider's website.
        3.  The attacker's DNS server (or network manipulation) redirects the user to a fake server.
        4.  The fake server presents a fake login page.
        5.  User enters their credentials on the fake page.
        6.  Attacker captures the credentials.
        7.  Attacker uses the captured credentials to log in to the legitimate provider.
        8.  Attacker initiates the OmniAuth flow with the target application, using the compromised provider account.
        9.  If the application does not have additional security measures, the attacker gains access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use DNSSEC to ensure DNS record integrity.
        *   Monitor DNS records for unauthorized changes.
        *   Use HTTPS for all provider interactions, even redirects.
        *   Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).

## Attack Tree Path: [2a1/3a1. Missing `state` Parameter in Callback (CSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/2a13a1__missing__state__parameter_in_callback__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** The `state` parameter is used for CSRF protection in the OmniAuth flow. If it's missing, incorrectly generated, or not validated, an attacker can forge a request to the application's callback URL, bypassing the authentication process with the provider.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker crafts a malicious URL that points to the application's OmniAuth callback endpoint. This URL includes manipulated parameters but omits the `state` parameter or includes an invalid one.
        2.  Attacker tricks the user into clicking the malicious URL (e.g., through social engineering or a hidden iframe).
        3.  The user's browser sends the request to the application's callback URL.
        4.  Because the `state` parameter is missing or invalid, the application does not properly verify the request's origin.
        5.  The application processes the request as if it were a legitimate response from the provider, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure the `state` parameter is *always* generated securely (using a cryptographically secure random number generator) and stored in the user's session *before* initiating the OmniAuth flow.
        *   In the callback handler, *always* verify that the `state` parameter is present in the request and that it matches the value stored in the user's session.
        *   Use a robust CSRF protection library for the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3a2. Replay Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/3a2__replay_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker captures a legitimate, successful OmniAuth callback request and replays it to the application. If the application doesn't have replay protection, it might process the request again, potentially granting the attacker access or allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker intercepts a valid OmniAuth callback request (e.g., through network sniffing or a compromised proxy).
        2.  Attacker saves the request data.
        3.  Attacker sends the saved request to the application's callback URL at a later time.
        4.  If the application does not have replay protection, it processes the request as if it were a new, legitimate response from the provider.
        5.  The attacker may gain unauthorized access or be able to perform actions associated with the original request.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement nonce (number used once) validation. Generate a unique nonce for each OmniAuth request, store it in the user's session, and include it in the request to the provider. In the callback handler, verify that the nonce is present and matches the stored value.  Invalidate the nonce after it's used.
        *   Implement timestamp validation. Include a timestamp in the request to the provider. In the callback handler, check that the timestamp is within an acceptable time window (e.g., a few minutes).

## Attack Tree Path: [3b1. Trusting Provider Data Implicitly (e.g., email)](./attack_tree_paths/3b1__trusting_provider_data_implicitly__e_g___email_.md)

*   **Description:** The application automatically links a user's account to an existing account based solely on information provided by the OmniAuth provider (e.g., email address) without additional verification. This is a major security flaw.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker creates an account on the provider (e.g., Google, Facebook) using the same email address as a legitimate user of the target application.
        2.  Attacker initiates the OmniAuth flow with the target application, using the attacker-controlled provider account.
        3.  The application receives the user information from the provider, including the email address.
        4.  The application *incorrectly* assumes that because the email address matches an existing user, it's the same person.
        5.  The application grants the attacker access to the existing user's account.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* automatically link accounts based solely on email address or any other single piece of information from the provider.
        *   Implement a secure account linking process that requires the user to prove ownership of *both* accounts. This could involve:
            *   Sending a verification code to the email address associated with the existing account.
            *   Requiring the user to enter a password for the existing account.
            *   Using a multi-factor authentication challenge.
        *   Clearly communicate to the user that they are linking accounts and the implications of doing so.
