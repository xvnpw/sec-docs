# Attack Surface Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Attack Surface: [1. Authentication Bypass via Strategy Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/1__authentication_bypass_via_strategy_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in individual OmniAuth strategies (e.g., `omniauth-facebook`) allow attackers to bypass authentication and impersonate users.
    *   **How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth *relies entirely* on external strategies to handle provider interactions.  The security of the authentication process is directly tied to the strategy's security.
    *   **Example:** A strategy fails to properly validate a JWT signature from the provider, allowing an attacker to forge a token.  An outdated strategy with a known vulnerability against the provider's API is exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover; unauthorized access to user data and application functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use only well-maintained and actively developed strategies.
            *   Keep all strategies updated to the latest versions.
            *   Thoroughly audit chosen strategies for security vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement robust input validation and error handling for all data from strategies.
            *   Monitor for security advisories related to the strategies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Callback Manipulation (CSRF/Open Redirect)](./attack_surfaces/2__callback_manipulation__csrfopen_redirect_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the callback URL or parameters after provider authentication, leading to CSRF or open redirects.
    *   **How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth *defines* the callback mechanism as a core part of its flow.  Improper handling of this *OmniAuth-defined* callback is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link with a manipulated `state` parameter or injects parameters into the callback URL.  The callback handler has an open redirect vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user; redirection to malicious sites; phishing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly validate the `state` parameter (if used) to prevent CSRF.
            *   Validate *all* parameters received in the OmniAuth callback.
            *   Use a whitelist of allowed callback URLs.
            *   Ensure the callback handler is not vulnerable to open redirects.

## Attack Surface: [3. Access/Refresh Token Leakage](./attack_surfaces/3__accessrefresh_token_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive access/refresh tokens obtained *through* OmniAuth are exposed, allowing user impersonation.
    *   **How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth is the *mechanism* by which these tokens are obtained and (potentially) handled by the application.  Improper handling *after* OmniAuth's process is the issue, but OmniAuth is the source.
    *   **Example:** Tokens are stored in unencrypted logs, exposed in client-side JavaScript, or accessible due to a database breach (where OmniAuth stored them).
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover on the provider's platform; access to user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Store tokens securely using encryption (at rest and in transit).
            *   Never expose tokens in client-side code, logs, or error messages.
            *   Implement robust access controls to protect stored tokens.
            *   Use short-lived tokens when possible.
            *   Implement token revocation.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Data from Provider](./attack_surfaces/4__insufficient_validation_of_user-provided_data_from_provider.md)

*   **Description:** User data received from the provider *via OmniAuth* is not properly validated, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS.
    *   **How OmniAuth Contributes:** OmniAuth is the *conduit* through which this potentially malicious data flows into the application. The application's failure to validate is the core issue, but the data *originates* from OmniAuth's interaction.
    *   **Example:** A user's display name on the provider contains a JavaScript payload. The application, receiving this via OmniAuth, displays it unsanitized.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, SQL injection, or other injection attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Treat *all* data from OmniAuth strategies as untrusted.
            * Validate and sanitize all user data before use, especially before display.
            * Use appropriate output encoding to prevent XSS.
            * Implement input validation.

## Attack Surface: [5. Misconfiguration (Hardcoded Secrets, Incorrect `provider_ignores_state`)](./attack_surfaces/5__misconfiguration__hardcoded_secrets__incorrect__provider_ignores_state__.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of *OmniAuth itself* or its strategies.
    *   **How OmniAuth Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability of misusing the OmniAuth library or its configuration options.
    *   **Example:** Client IDs/secrets are hardcoded. `provider_ignores_state` is set to `true` unnecessarily, disabling CSRF protection *within OmniAuth's flow*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can range from information disclosure to authentication bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or secure configuration.
            *   Only set `provider_ignores_state` to `true` if absolutely necessary and with full understanding of the implications.
            *   Follow official OmniAuth documentation and best practices.
