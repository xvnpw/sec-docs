# Threat Model Analysis for omniauth/omniauth

## Threat: [Forged Provider Response (Authentication Bypass)](./threats/forged_provider_response__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Forged Provider Response (Authentication Bypass)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious response, mimicking a successful authentication from a legitimate provider (e.g., Google, Facebook). They modify the `uid`, `email`, or other attributes in the response to impersonate an existing user or create a new account with elevated privileges. The attacker doesn't need to compromise the provider; they manipulate the data returned to the application.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the targeted user's account, potentially accessing sensitive data, performing actions on their behalf, or gaining administrative privileges.
    *   **Component Affected:**  The OmniAuth callback handler (e.g., a controller action in Rails) that processes the response from the provider. Specifically, the code that extracts user information from the `request.env['omniauth.auth']` hash (or equivalent) and creates/updates user records.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict `uid` and `provider` Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of the `uid` and `provider` fields. Ensure they conform to expected formats and haven't been tampered with. Do *not* rely solely on email or other easily spoofed data.
        *   **`state` Parameter Verification:** Ensure the `state` parameter is used and correctly verified to prevent CSRF. OmniAuth strategies should handle this, but verify it's enabled.
        *   **Provider-Specific Validation:** If the provider offers additional verification (e.g., signed responses, ID tokens), use them. For OpenID Connect, validate the ID token's signature and claims.
        *   **Don't Trust `email_verified` Blindly:** If relying on `email_verified`, understand its limitations. Some providers might not rigorously verify emails. Consider your own email verification if email is critical.

## Threat: [Strategy Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/strategy_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Strategy Vulnerability Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a specific OmniAuth strategy gem (e.g., `omniauth-github`, `omniauth-google-oauth2`). These vulnerabilities could allow for various attacks, including authentication bypass, information disclosure, or denial of service. The attacker leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability in the strategy's code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure (leaking user data) to complete authentication bypass and account takeover.
    *   **Component Affected:** The specific OmniAuth strategy gem (e.g., `omniauth-github-1.4.0`). The vulnerability could be in any part of the strategy's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Strategies Updated:** Regularly update all OmniAuth strategy gems to the latest versions. Use dependency management tools (e.g., Bundler).
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   **Use Reputable Strategies:** Choose well-maintained and actively developed strategies. Check the gem's repository for activity.

## Threat: [Callback URL Manipulation (Redirection Attack)](./threats/callback_url_manipulation__redirection_attack_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Callback URL Manipulation (Redirection Attack)

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the callback URL to which the provider redirects the user after authentication. They might inject a malicious URL, causing redirection to a phishing site or a site that exploits browser vulnerabilities. The attacker might modify query parameters or use open redirect vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** The user could be tricked into revealing credentials or other sensitive information on a phishing site. They might also be exposed to malware.
    *   **Component Affected:** The OmniAuth configuration and the callback handler. Specifically, the code that determines the callback URL and handles the redirect.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Static Callback URL:** Use a static, pre-defined callback URL in your OmniAuth configuration. Do *not* allow the callback URL to be specified dynamically.
        *   **Whitelist Validation:** If dynamic callback URLs are absolutely necessary (strongly discouraged), implement strict whitelist validation.
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Use HTTPS for all callback URLs.

## Threat: [Session Fixation after OmniAuth](./threats/session_fixation_after_omniauth.md)

* **Threat:** Session Fixation after OmniAuth

    * **Description:** An attacker sets a user's session ID *before* the user authenticates via OmniAuth. After successful authentication, the application fails to regenerate the session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the authenticated session.
    * **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's account after they have successfully authenticated.
    * **Component Affected:** The session management logic *after* the OmniAuth callback. This is typically handled by the web framework (e.g., Rails), but the integration with OmniAuth needs to ensure proper session regeneration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Session Regeneration:** Ensure that the session ID is *always* regenerated after successful OmniAuth authentication. Most frameworks provide a method for this (e.g., `reset_session` in Rails). This should be done *before* setting any user-related data in the session.
