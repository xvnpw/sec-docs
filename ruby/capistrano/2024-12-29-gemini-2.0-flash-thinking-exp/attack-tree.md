## Capistrano Threat Model - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application servers managed by Capistrano by exploiting weaknesses within the Capistrano deployment process.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Servers via Capistrano Exploitation **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Compromise Deployment Process (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * **Compromise SSH Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * Phishing for SSH Keys/Passwords **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
            * Exploiting Weak SSH Key Passphrases **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
            * Stealing SSH Keys from Developer Machines **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
        * **Modify Deployment Scripts (Rake Tasks) (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * **Compromise Source Code Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
                * Compromise Developer Account **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
        * **Exploit Capistrano Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (e.g., API Keys, Database Credentials) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK STEP)**
        * **Compromise the Control Machine Running Capistrano (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * Compromise User Account on the Control Machine **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
            * Malware Infection on the Control Machine **(HIGH-RISK STEP)**
    * **Exploit Capistrano's Interaction with Servers (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * **Abuse Privileged Commands Executed by Capistrano (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * **Inject Malicious Commands via Configuration or Hooks (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK STEP)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Servers via Capistrano Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access and control over the application servers managed by Capistrano, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other significant damage.

* **Compromise Deployment Process (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on subverting the deployment process itself. By gaining control over how code is deployed, an attacker can introduce malicious changes or gain access to the servers.

* **Compromise SSH Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is a critical entry point. If an attacker obtains the SSH credentials used by Capistrano to connect to the target servers, they can directly access and control those servers, bypassing many other security measures.
        * **Phishing for SSH Keys/Passwords (HIGH-RISK STEP):** Attackers use deceptive emails or websites to trick developers or operators into revealing their SSH keys or passwords.
        * **Exploiting Weak SSH Key Passphrases (HIGH-RISK STEP):** If SSH keys are protected with weak or easily guessable passphrases, attackers can crack them and gain access.
        * **Stealing SSH Keys from Developer Machines (HIGH-RISK STEP):** Attackers compromise developer workstations through malware or other means to steal stored SSH keys.

* **Modify Deployment Scripts (Rake Tasks) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * By altering the scripts that Capistrano executes during deployment, attackers can inject malicious code that will be run on the target servers with the privileges of the deployment user.
        * **Compromise Source Code Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** Gaining control of the source code repository allows attackers to modify deployment scripts and other application code persistently.
            * **Compromise Developer Account (HIGH-RISK STEP):** Attackers compromise developer accounts on the code repository platform to push malicious changes.

* **Exploit Capistrano Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Insecure configuration of Capistrano can directly expose sensitive information or create opportunities for exploitation.
        * **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (e.g., API Keys, Database Credentials) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK STEP):** If sensitive credentials are stored in plain text or easily accessible configuration files, attackers can directly retrieve them.

* **Compromise the Control Machine Running Capistrano (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * If the machine from which Capistrano deployments are initiated is compromised, the attacker gains control over the entire deployment process and can manipulate deployments at will.
        * **Compromise User Account on the Control Machine (HIGH-RISK STEP):** Attackers compromise user accounts on the control machine to gain access to Capistrano and its configurations.
        * **Malware Infection on the Control Machine (HIGH-RISK STEP):** Malware on the control machine can intercept credentials, modify deployment commands, or directly access target servers.

* **Exploit Capistrano's Interaction with Servers (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on abusing Capistrano's ability to execute commands on the target servers.
        * **Abuse Privileged Commands Executed by Capistrano (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Capistrano often executes commands with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`).
            * **Inject Malicious Commands via Configuration or Hooks (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK STEP):** Attackers can inject malicious commands into Capistrano configuration or hooks, which will then be executed on the target servers with the privileges of the deployment user, potentially including root access.
