## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes can lead to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Capistrano Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_capistrano_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in the Capistrano configuration files to inject malicious code or manipulate the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Malicious Code in `deploy.rb`](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__malicious_code_in__deploy_rb_.md)

Injecting malicious code directly into the `deploy.rb` file or included configuration files allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target servers during deployment with the privileges of the deployment user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Developer Machine](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_developer_machine.md)

Gaining control of a developer's machine provides access to source code, credentials, and the ability to directly influence the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Phishing Attack](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__phishing_attack.md)

Tricking developers into revealing credentials or installing malware through deceptive emails or websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Malware Infection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__malware_infection.md)

Infecting developer machines with malware (e.g., keyloggers, remote access trojans) to steal credentials or gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Version Control System](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_version_control_system.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to the VCS repository allows attackers to modify the codebase, including the `deploy.rb` file, ensuring malicious code is deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Account Takeover](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__account_takeover.md)

Compromising developer accounts on the VCS platform through methods like password cracking, credential stuffing, or phishing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Repository Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__direct_repository_manipulation.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in the VCS platform itself to directly modify the repository without proper authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure SSH Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_ssh_key_management.md)

Exploiting weaknesses in how SSH keys are stored and managed, such as storing private keys without strong passphrases or in insecure locations on developer machines. This allows attackers to impersonate authorized users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SSH Access Used by Capistrano](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_ssh_access_used_by_capistrano.md)

Attackers focus on compromising the SSH connection used by Capistrano to execute commands on the target servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Deployment User Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_deployment_user_credentials.md)

Obtaining the username and password of the user Capistrano uses to connect to the servers allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/credential_stuffing.md)

Using lists of known username/password combinations from previous data breaches to attempt to log in to the deployment user account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Keylogger on Developer/Deployment Machine](./attack_tree_paths/keylogger_on_developerdeployment_machine.md)

Installing a keylogger on a developer's machine or the machine initiating the deployment to capture the deployment user's credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise SSH Keys](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_ssh_keys.md)

Gaining access to the SSH private keys used by Capistrano for authentication provides passwordless access to the target servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Stored Private Keys on Developer Machine](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_stored_private_keys_on_developer_machine.md)

Directly accessing the files where SSH private keys are stored on a compromised developer machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Passphrase on Key](./attack_tree_paths/weak_passphrase_on_key.md)

Brute-forcing the passphrase protecting an SSH private key if it is weak.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Implicit Trust in Deployment Environment](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_implicit_trust_in_deployment_environment.md)

Attackers target components within the deployment pipeline that are trusted by the final deployment stage, allowing them to inject malicious code or artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Intermediate Servers](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_intermediate_servers.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in build or staging servers to inject malicious code or artifacts that will be deployed to production.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Artifact Storage](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_artifact_storage.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to the repository where deployment artifacts (e.g., compiled code, container images) are stored.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Gain Access to Artifact Repository](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__gain_access_to_artifact_repository.md)

Compromising credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in the artifact repository to gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Replace Valid Artifacts with Malicious Ones](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__replace_valid_artifacts_with_malicious_ones.md)

Once access to the artifact repository is gained, replacing legitimate deployment artifacts with compromised versions.
