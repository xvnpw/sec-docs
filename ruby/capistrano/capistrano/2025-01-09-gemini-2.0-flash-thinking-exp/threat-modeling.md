# Threat Model Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the `deploy.rb` file or included configuration files (e.g., through a compromised developer machine or repository access) and reads hardcoded credentials like database passwords, API keys, or other secrets. The attacker might then use these credentials to access backend systems or external services.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to critical resources, compromise of external services.

**Affected Capistrano Component:** Configuration loading and management within `Capistrano::Configuration`, specifically how `deploy.rb` and included files are processed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in `deploy.rb` or included files.
* Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and inject sensitive information.
* Ensure `deploy.rb` and related files have appropriate access controls in the version control system.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Capistrano Hooks](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_capistrano_hooks.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the `deploy.rb` file or related deployment scripts injects malicious code into Capistrano hooks (e.g., `before_deploy`, `after_deploy`). This code will be executed on the deployment server and potentially on the target servers during the deployment process, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands or compromise the application.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on deployment and target servers, deployment of compromised application code, data breaches.

**Affected Capistrano Component:** The hook system within Capistrano, specifically the execution of tasks defined within the `deploy.rb` file and its included files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the `deploy.rb` file and related deployment scripts.
* Conduct thorough code reviews of all Capistrano hooks and custom tasks.
* Use version control for deployment scripts and track changes.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Unsafe Variable Interpolation in Tasks](./threats/command_injection_through_unsafe_variable_interpolation_in_tasks.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates input that is used in Capistrano tasks involving remote command execution without proper sanitization. This could happen if variables derived from external sources or user input are directly interpolated into shell commands executed on the target servers. The attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed with the privileges of the deployment user.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on target servers, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Capistrano Component:** Task execution mechanism within Capistrano, particularly when using methods like `execute` or `sudo` with dynamically generated command strings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly interpolating untrusted input into shell commands.
* Use parameterized commands or escape shell arguments properly to prevent command injection.
* Validate and sanitize any external input used in Capistrano tasks.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Capistrano or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_capistrano_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Capistrano or its underlying dependencies (e.g., `net-ssh`) contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities on the deployment server if they are not patched. This could lead to remote code execution or other security breaches.

**Impact:** Potential compromise of the deployment server, leading to further attacks on target servers.

**Affected Capistrano Component:** The core Capistrano gem and its dependencies managed through Bundler or similar package managers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Capistrano and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for Capistrano and its dependencies.
