# Attack Surface Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Deployment Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_deployment_keys.md)

**Attack Surface: Compromised Deployment Keys**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to the SSH private keys used by Capistrano to connect to target servers.
    * **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano *directly* relies on SSH key-based authentication for automated deployments. The security of these keys is paramount to Capistrano's functionality.
    * **Example:** A developer's laptop containing the deployment key is stolen, or the key is inadvertently committed to a public repository.
    * **Impact:** Full administrative access to the target servers, allowing for data breaches, application disruption, malware installation, and complete system takeover.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Passphrases:** Protect private keys with strong, unique passphrases.
        * **Secure Key Storage:** Store private keys securely with appropriate file permissions, ideally using dedicated key management tools or hardware security modules (HSMs) where feasible.
        * **Limited Key Distribution:** Restrict access to deployment keys to only necessary personnel and systems.
        * **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate deployment keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
        * **Agent Forwarding with Caution:** If using SSH agent forwarding, understand the risks and ensure the client machine is secure. Consider using jump hosts or bastion servers.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Information in Capistrano Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_information_in_capistrano_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Surface: Sensitive Information in Capistrano Configuration Files**
    * **Description:** Sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets are stored directly within Capistrano configuration files (e.g., `deploy.rb`, `secrets.yml`).
    * **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano uses these configuration files to define deployment settings and often requires access to application secrets *that are configured within these files*.
    * **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded in `deploy.rb` and the repository is compromised, exposing these credentials.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and potential compromise of external services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Environment Variables:** Utilize environment variables to store sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
        * **Secrets Management Tools:** Integrate with dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely manage and inject secrets during deployment.
        * **Avoid Committing Secrets:** Never commit sensitive information directly to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude files containing secrets.
        * **Encryption at Rest:** If storing secrets in files, encrypt them at rest and ensure secure decryption during deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Capistrano Tasks or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_capistrano_tasks_or_plugins.md)

**Attack Surface: Malicious Capistrano Tasks or Plugins**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to inject or modify Capistrano tasks or utilizes vulnerable third-party Capistrano plugins to execute malicious code on the target servers.
    * **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano's task-based architecture *directly* allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on remote servers. Compromised tasks or vulnerable plugins *extend this execution capability*.
    * **Example:** An attacker with access to the codebase modifies a Capistrano task to create a backdoor user on the production server during deployment. Or, a vulnerable plugin is used that allows for remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on target servers, leading to system compromise, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Review for Custom Tasks:** Thoroughly review all custom Capistrano tasks for potential vulnerabilities and ensure proper input sanitization.
        * **Secure Plugin Selection:** Carefully evaluate and select Capistrano plugins from trusted sources. Keep plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user under which Capistrano tasks are executed has the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Input Validation:** If tasks accept external input, implement robust input validation to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Deployment Machine](./attack_surfaces/compromised_deployment_machine.md)

**Attack Surface: Compromised Deployment Machine**
    * **Description:** The machine used to run Capistrano deployments is compromised, allowing attackers to manipulate the deployment process.
    * **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano deployments are *initiated from* a specific machine, making its security crucial for the integrity of the deployment *orchestrated by Capistrano*.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the deployment server and modifies the `deploy.rb` file or injects malicious code into the deployment workflow *managed by Capistrano*.
    * **Impact:** Ability to deploy malicious code, alter server configurations, and potentially gain access to target servers.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Harden Deployment Machine:** Secure the deployment machine with strong passwords, regular security updates, and restrict unnecessary services.
        * **Access Control:** Implement strict access control to the deployment machine, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the deployment machine and its configuration.
        * **Dedicated Deployment Environment:** Isolate the deployment environment from other development or production systems.
