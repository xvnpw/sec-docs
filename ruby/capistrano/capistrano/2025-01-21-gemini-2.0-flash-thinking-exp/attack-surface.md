# Attack Surface Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Attack Surface: [Compromised SSH Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_ssh_keys.md)

**Attack Surface: Compromised SSH Keys**
    *   **Description:**  The private SSH keys used by Capistrano to authenticate with target servers are compromised.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano relies on SSH key-based authentication for automated deployments. If these keys fall into the wrong hands, attackers gain the same access as Capistrano.
    *   **Example:** A developer's laptop containing the deployment SSH key is stolen or infected with malware.
    *   **Impact:** Full unauthorized access to the target servers, allowing attackers to deploy malicious code, modify data, or disrupt services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Key Rotation: Regularly rotate SSH keys used for deployment.
        *   Passphrase Protection: Protect private keys with strong passphrases.
        *   Agent Forwarding (with caution): Use SSH agent forwarding securely, ensuring the agent is protected.
        *   Restricted Permissions: Ensure private keys have restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`).
        *   Hardware Security Modules (HSMs): For highly sensitive environments, consider storing keys in HSMs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of SSH Keys](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_ssh_keys.md)

**Attack Surface: Insecure Storage of SSH Keys**
    *   **Description:** SSH keys used by Capistrano are stored insecurely on the deployment machine.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano needs access to the private key to connect to target servers. If the storage location is not properly secured, it becomes an easy target.
    *   **Example:** The private key is stored in a world-readable directory or within the project repository.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the private key, leading to potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict File Permissions: Ensure private keys have restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`).
        *   Avoid Storing in Repositories: Never commit private keys to version control systems.
        *   Encrypt at Rest: Consider encrypting the deployment machine's filesystem or using dedicated secrets management tools.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Capistrano Gem or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_capistrano_gem_or_dependencies.md)

**Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Capistrano Gem or Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Capistrano gem itself or its dependencies.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** By using Capistrano, the application becomes reliant on its code and the code of its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of the `net-ssh` gem (a Capistrano dependency) allows for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the deployment machine or even the target servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Capistrano Updated: Regularly update Capistrano to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Dependency Auditing: Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `rails_best_practices` to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories related to Capistrano and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Deployment Credentials in Capistrano Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_deployment_credentials_in_capistrano_configuration.md)

**Attack Surface: Exposure of Deployment Credentials in Capistrano Configuration**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys) required for deployment tasks are stored directly in Capistrano configuration files.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano configuration files (like `deploy.rb`) can contain instructions and credentials needed for deployment.
    *   **Example:** A database password is hardcoded in the `database.yml.erb` file that is processed by Capistrano during deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources if the configuration files are exposed (e.g., through a compromised repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Environment Variables: Store sensitive credentials as environment variables and access them within Capistrano tasks.
        *   Secrets Management Tools: Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage credentials.
        *   Avoid Committing Secrets: Never commit sensitive information directly to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Deployment Scripts](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_deployment_scripts.md)

**Attack Surface: Malicious Code Injection via Deployment Scripts**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into Capistrano deployment scripts or custom tasks.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano executes the defined deployment scripts on the target servers. If these scripts are compromised, malicious code will be executed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the codebase and adds a command to a Capistrano task that creates a backdoor user on the target servers.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on target servers, allowing for complete compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Code Reviews: Thoroughly review all Capistrano deployment scripts and custom tasks for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Access Control: Restrict access to modify deployment scripts to authorized personnel only.
        *   Immutable Infrastructure: Consider using immutable infrastructure principles to reduce the attack surface for script modification.
        *   CI/CD Pipeline Security: Secure the entire CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications to deployment scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation on Target Servers](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_on_target_servers.md)

**Attack Surface: Privilege Escalation on Target Servers**
    *   **Description:** The user account used by Capistrano on the target servers has excessive privileges.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano executes commands on the target servers using the configured user account. If this account has too many permissions, it can be abused.
    *   **Example:** The Capistrano deployment user has `sudo` access without a password, allowing an attacker who compromises the deployment process to gain root privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the target servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant the Capistrano deployment user only the necessary permissions to perform deployment tasks.
        *   Avoid Sudo Access: Minimize or eliminate the need for `sudo` access for the deployment user. If necessary, use fine-grained `sudoers` configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Release Directories](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_release_directories.md)

**Attack Surface: Manipulation of Release Directories**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the target servers and manipulates the release directories managed by Capistrano.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano creates and manages release directories on the target servers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious code into a previous release directory, and then triggers a rollback to that compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Access: Limit access to the release directories on the target servers to authorized personnel and processes.
        *   File Integrity Monitoring: Implement tools to monitor the integrity of files within the release directories.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deployment Machine](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deployment_machine.md)

**Attack Surface: Insecure Deployment Machine**
    *   **Description:** The machine running Capistrano is compromised.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** The deployment machine is the source of the deployment process and holds sensitive information like SSH keys used by Capistrano.
    *   **Example:** The deployment server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to gain access and potentially steal SSH keys or modify Capistrano configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the deployment process, potential compromise of target servers through stolen credentials or injected code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Security Hardening: Implement security best practices for the deployment machine, including regular patching, strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   Restrict Access: Limit access to the deployment machine to authorized personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation in Custom Capistrano Tasks](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_in_custom_capistrano_tasks.md)

**Attack Surface: Lack of Input Validation in Custom Capistrano Tasks**
    *   **Description:** Custom Capistrano tasks accept user-provided input without proper validation, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano allows for the creation of custom tasks that can interact with user input or external data.
    *   **Example:** A custom task takes a filename as input and uses it in a shell command without sanitization, leading to command injection that Capistrano then executes on the target server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the target servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided input in custom Capistrano tasks.
        *   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities in custom tasks.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure custom tasks run with the minimum necessary privileges.
