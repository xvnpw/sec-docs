# Threat Model Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Threat: [Compromised SSH Keys](./threats/compromised_ssh_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the SSH private keys used *by Capistrano* to connect to target servers. This allows them to directly leverage Capistrano's authentication mechanism. They might obtain these keys from the deployment machine, a compromised CI/CD environment, or insecure storage. Once obtained, the attacker can impersonate the Capistrano user *through Capistrano*.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target servers *via Capistrano*, deploy malicious code *using Capistrano's deployment process*, modify application configurations, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. This can lead to a full compromise of the deployed application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Capistrano Component Affected:** `SSHKit` (the underlying SSH execution library used by Capistrano), the user account running Capistrano on the deployment machine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store SSH private keys securely, ideally using encrypted storage or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) accessible to the Capistrano deployment process.
*   Implement strong access controls on the deployment machine to restrict access to the Capistrano user's home directory and SSH keys.
*   Regularly rotate SSH keys used *for Capistrano deployments*.
*   Consider using SSH agent forwarding with extreme caution and understand its security implications within the Capistrano context.
*   Prefer certificate-based authentication over password-based authentication for SSH connections *used by Capistrano*.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the user account running Capistrano on the deployment machine.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Deployment Scripts](./threats/malicious_code_in_deployment_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the Capistrano configuration files (e.g., `deploy.rb`, custom tasks) injects malicious code. This directly manipulates *Capistrano's deployment logic*. This could happen through a compromised developer account, a vulnerability in the version control system hosting the Capistrano configuration, or a supply chain attack targeting deployment dependencies. The malicious code will be executed on the target servers *as part of the Capistrano deployment process*.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the deployment user *through Capistrano*, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, installation of backdoors, or denial of service.

**Capistrano Component Affected:** `Capistrano::DSL` (for defining tasks), custom task definitions, `deploy.rb` configuration file.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls for the repository containing Capistrano configuration files.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of all deployment scripts and custom tasks before they are committed.
*   Utilize version control and track changes to deployment configurations.
*   Employ static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in deployment scripts.
*   Implement a code review process that includes security considerations for Capistrano configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets, is hardcoded or stored insecurely within *Capistrano configuration files* (e.g., `deploy.rb`, `.env` files directly referenced by Capistrano). An attacker gaining access to these files can directly retrieve this sensitive information intended for use by Capistrano.

**Impact:** The attacker can use the exposed credentials to access databases, external services, or other protected resources, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or financial loss. This is a direct consequence of insecurely managing secrets within the Capistrano setup.

**Capistrano Component Affected:** `Capistrano::Configuration`, `deploy.rb`, any files directly included or sourced by Capistrano configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Capistrano configuration files.
*   Utilize environment variables to manage sensitive configuration data *accessed by Capistrano*.
*   Consider using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Capistrano to securely retrieve secrets during deployment.
*   Ensure that `.env` files or similar containing secrets are not committed to the version control repository and are not directly accessible by Capistrano without proper security measures.
*   Implement proper file permissions on Capistrano configuration files to restrict access.

## Threat: [Insufficient Permissions on Target Servers](./threats/insufficient_permissions_on_target_servers.md)

**Description:** The user account used *by Capistrano* on the target servers has overly broad permissions. If this account is compromised (e.g., through compromised SSH keys used by Capistrano), the attacker can perform actions beyond the intended deployment tasks *via Capistrano*.

**Impact:** The attacker can potentially escalate privileges, modify system configurations, access sensitive data outside the application's scope, or disrupt other services running on the server, all initiated through the compromised Capistrano user.

**Capistrano Component Affected:** The user account configured for `user` in `deploy.rb` or through other Capistrano settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply the principle of least privilege. Grant the Capistrano user only the necessary permissions for deployment tasks.
*   Utilize `sudo` with specific command restrictions for tasks requiring elevated privileges *executed by Capistrano*.
*   Implement proper user and group management on the target servers, specifically considering the permissions of the Capistrano deployment user.
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions of the Capistrano user.
