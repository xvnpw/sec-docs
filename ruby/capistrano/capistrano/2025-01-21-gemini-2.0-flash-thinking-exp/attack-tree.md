## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Weaknesses in Capistrano Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_weaknesses_in_capistrano_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecurely configured Capistrano deployments. Attackers target configuration files to gain sensitive information or manipulate the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Expose Sensitive Information in Configuration Files (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__expose_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files__high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node involves attackers gaining access to configuration files (like `deploy.rb`) that contain sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Access Plaintext Credentials in `deploy.rb` (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__access_plaintext_credentials_in__deploy_rb___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers directly access the `deploy.rb` file (e.g., through a compromised developer machine, exposed repository, or insecure server) and find plaintext credentials (passwords, API keys) used for deployment or application services.
**Impact:** Critical. Direct access to application infrastructure, databases, or external services.
**Mitigation:** Never store credentials in plaintext in configuration files. Use environment variables, secure vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted secrets management. Implement strict access controls on configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Tamper with Deployment Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__tamper_with_deployment_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node involves attackers modifying the deployment configuration to inject malicious code or alter the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Modify `deploy.rb` to Execute Malicious Tasks (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__modify__deploy_rb__to_execute_malicious_tasks__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers with write access to the `deploy.rb` file (e.g., through a compromised developer machine or repository) inject malicious Ruby code that will be executed on the target servers during the deployment process. This could involve creating backdoors, installing malware, or manipulating application data.
**Impact:** Critical. Full control over the deployment servers, potential for data breaches, and system compromise.
**Mitigation:** Implement strict access controls on `deploy.rb` and other deployment configuration files. Use code reviews for all changes to deployment scripts. Implement version control and audit trails for configuration changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Deployment Server Access via Capistrano (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_deployment_server_access_via_capistrano__high_risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on attackers gaining unauthorized access to the deployment servers by exploiting weaknesses in SSH key management.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Weak SSH Key Management (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_weak_ssh_key_management__high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node involves attackers targeting the SSH private keys used by Capistrano for authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Steal or Guess SSH Private Keys Used by Capistrano (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__steal_or_guess_ssh_private_keys_used_by_capistrano__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers obtain the SSH private keys used by Capistrano. This could happen through various means: stealing them from a developer's machine, finding them in insecure storage, or through social engineering. Weak passphrases on the keys could also allow attackers to brute-force them.
**Impact:** Critical. Complete unauthorized access to the deployment servers, allowing for arbitrary command execution, data manipulation, and system compromise.
**Mitigation:** Use strong, unique passphrases for SSH private keys. Store SSH keys securely and restrict access. Consider using SSH certificates for authentication. Implement regular key rotation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Developer's Local Machine Running Capistrano (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_developer's_local_machine_running_capistrano__high_risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path highlights the risk of attackers compromising the developer's machine, which can then be used to attack the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Steal Deployment Credentials from Developer's Machine (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__steal_deployment_credentials_from_developer's_machine__high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node involves attackers extracting deployment credentials from the developer's compromised machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Access Stored SSH Keys (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__access_stored_ssh_keys__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the developer's local machine (e.g., through malware, phishing, or physical access) and steal the SSH private keys stored there, which are used by Capistrano.
**Impact:** Critical. Ability to impersonate the developer and execute deployments, leading to potential system compromise.
**Mitigation:** Enforce strong security practices on developer machines, including endpoint security software, regular patching, and security awareness training. Encrypt SSH keys with strong passphrases. Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly on developer machines if possible (use SSH agent with caution or dedicated credential management tools).
