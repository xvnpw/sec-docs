### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: Over-permissive Deploy User Permissions

#### 4.1. Detailed Threat Description

The "Over-permissive Deploy User Permissions" threat arises when the user account designated for Capistrano deployments on target servers is granted privileges beyond what is strictly necessary for performing deployment tasks. This is a violation of the **Principle of Least Privilege**, a fundamental security principle that dictates users and processes should only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their designated functions.

In the context of Capistrano, this typically manifests as:

*   **Unrestricted `sudo` Access:** The deploy user is allowed to execute any command with `sudo` without password prompts, effectively granting them root-level privileges on demand. This is often configured by adding the deploy user to the `sudoers` file with `ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`.
*   **Direct Root Access:** In extreme cases, the deploy user account might even be configured as the root user itself, or granted direct login access as root via SSH (though less common, it's a critical misconfiguration).
*   **Excessive Group Memberships:** The deploy user might be added to groups that grant broad system-level permissions, such as `wheel`, `adm`, or other administrative groups, without careful consideration of the implications.
*   **Unnecessary File System Permissions:** The deploy user might have write access to critical system directories or files beyond the deployment target directory, allowing for system-wide modifications.

The core problem is that if the deploy user account is compromised, the attacker inherits these excessive privileges. This dramatically escalates the severity of the compromise, turning a potentially contained incident into a full-scale system takeover.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

The primary attack vector for exploiting over-permissive deploy user permissions is **deploy user account compromise**. This can occur through various means:

*   **SSH Key Compromise:**  The most common scenario. If the private SSH key used for Capistrano deployments is compromised (e.g., stolen from a developer's machine, leaked through insecure storage, or obtained through phishing), an attacker can authenticate as the deploy user.
*   **Credential Theft:**  Less common in modern setups relying on SSH keys, but if password-based authentication is enabled for the deploy user (which is strongly discouraged), password cracking or phishing could lead to credential theft.
*   **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with access to deployment credentials or server configurations could intentionally exploit over-permissive permissions.
*   **Software Vulnerabilities (Less Direct):** While less direct, vulnerabilities in software used by the deploy user or running on the deployment server could be exploited to gain initial access, which could then be escalated due to over-permissive deploy user permissions.

Once an attacker gains access as the deploy user, the excessive permissions become immediately exploitable.

#### 4.3. Capistrano Component Affected: SSHKit User Switching

Capistrano leverages the `sshkit` gem for executing commands on remote servers via SSH.  `sshkit` provides mechanisms for user switching, allowing Capistrano to execute tasks under different user contexts.

*   **`:remote_user` Configuration:** Capistrano's `deploy.rb` configuration often includes the `:remote_user` setting, which specifies the user account used for SSH connections and initial command execution. This is typically the deploy user.
*   **`as user: 'some_user'` Block:**  Within Capistrano tasks, the `as user: 'some_user'` block in `sshkit` allows for switching the user context for specific commands. This is often used to perform tasks as `root` or another privileged user when necessary.

The threat arises when the `:remote_user` itself is granted excessive permissions. While `sshkit` provides the *ability* to switch users, it doesn't inherently enforce least privilege. If the initial `:remote_user` (the deploy user) is already over-privileged, the problem exists regardless of user switching within tasks. In fact, over-permissive deploy user permissions often *remove* the need for careful user switching, as the deploy user can already perform most actions directly.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

The impact of compromised over-permissive deploy user permissions is **High** and can be catastrophic:

*   **Immediate Root Access:** If the deploy user has unrestricted `sudo` access or is directly root, an attacker gains immediate root-level control upon account compromise. This allows them to perform any action on the server.
*   **Complete Server Takeover:** With root access, an attacker can completely take over the server. This includes:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data, application code, databases, configuration files, etc.
    *   **Malware Installation:** Installing backdoors, rootkits, and other malware for persistent access and further malicious activities.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Modifying system configurations, deleting critical files, or launching denial-of-service attacks to disrupt application availability.
    *   **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying application data, databases, or system logs to cover their tracks or cause further damage.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised servers with excessive permissions can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the infrastructure. If the compromised server has network access to other servers (databases, internal services, etc.), the attacker can leverage this access for lateral movement, potentially compromising the entire infrastructure.
*   **Actions Beyond Deployment Tasks:**  An attacker can perform actions far beyond the scope of deployment tasks. They can install arbitrary software, modify system configurations unrelated to the application, create new user accounts, and essentially treat the server as their own.
*   **Reputational Damage and Financial Loss:**  A successful attack can lead to significant reputational damage, financial losses due to service disruption, data breaches, regulatory fines, and recovery costs.

#### 4.5. Real-World Scenario Example

Imagine a scenario where a development team uses Capistrano to deploy a web application. They configure the `deploy` user on their servers with unrestricted `sudo` access for convenience during initial setup and testing, intending to restrict it later but forgetting to do so.

A developer's laptop, containing the private SSH key for the `deploy` user, is stolen. The attacker extracts the SSH key and uses it to connect to the deployment servers as the `deploy` user.

Because the `deploy` user has unrestricted `sudo` access, the attacker immediately gains root privileges. They can then:

1.  **Install a backdoor:**  Establish persistent access even if the initial vulnerability is patched.
2.  **Exfiltrate the application database:** Steal sensitive customer data.
3.  **Modify the web application:** Inject malicious code to deface the website or steal user credentials.
4.  **Pivot to other servers:** If the deployment server is in the same network as other internal systems, use it as a launchpad for further attacks.

This scenario highlights how over-permissive deploy user permissions can transform a relatively common incident (laptop theft) into a major security breach with severe consequences.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Deep Dive)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for addressing the "Over-permissive Deploy User Permissions" threat:

#### 5.1. Adhere Strictly to the Principle of Least Privilege

This is the foundational principle.  **Never grant the deploy user more permissions than absolutely necessary.**  This requires careful planning and understanding of the deployment process.

*   **Identify Minimum Required Permissions:**  Thoroughly analyze each step of your Capistrano deployment process and identify the specific actions the deploy user *must* perform. This might include:
    *   Reading and writing files within the deployment directory (`/var/www/your_app` or similar).
    *   Restarting application services (e.g., web server, application server).
    *   Running specific deployment-related commands (e.g., database migrations, asset compilation).
*   **Avoid Blanket `sudo` Access:**  Resist the temptation to grant unrestricted `sudo` access for convenience. It is a significant security risk.
*   **Regularly Review Permissions:**  Periodically review the permissions granted to the deploy user and ensure they are still aligned with the principle of least privilege. As deployment processes evolve, permissions might need to be adjusted, but always err on the side of restriction.

#### 5.2. Grant Minimum Permissions for Deployment Tasks

Focus on granting only the essential permissions identified in the previous step. This involves:

*   **File System Permissions:**
    *   **Deployment Directory Ownership:**  The deploy user should typically be the owner (or part of a group that owns) the deployment directory and its subdirectories. This allows them to create, modify, and delete files within the application deployment path.
    *   **Restrict Write Access Outside Deployment Directory:**  The deploy user should generally *not* have write access to system-wide directories like `/etc`, `/usr/bin`, `/var/log`, etc., unless absolutely necessary for a specific deployment task (which should be carefully scrutinized).
    *   **Use Group Permissions:**  Utilize group permissions effectively. For example, if the web server user needs read access to deployed files, add both the deploy user and the web server user to a common group and grant group read permissions to the deployment directory.
*   **Service Management Permissions:**
    *   **Specific Service Restart:**  Instead of granting general `sudo` access, configure `sudoers` to allow the deploy user to restart *only* the specific services required for the application (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart nginx.service`, `sudo systemctl restart puma.service`).
    *   **Avoid `sudo systemctl *` or `sudo service *`:**  Do not grant wildcard `sudo` access to service management commands. Be precise and list only the necessary services.
*   **Database Migrations and Other Commands:**
    *   **Specific Command Whitelisting:**  If deployment tasks require running specific commands that need elevated privileges (e.g., database migrations), configure `sudoers` to allow only those specific commands with necessary arguments.

#### 5.3. Restrict `sudo` Access with a Carefully Configured `sudoers` File

The `sudoers` file (`/etc/sudoers` or files in `/etc/sudoers.d/`) is critical for controlling `sudo` access.  **Never edit `/etc/sudoers` directly using `vi`**. Always use `visudo` to edit it, as `visudo` performs syntax checking and prevents accidental corruption.

*   **Targeted `sudo` Rules:**  Instead of `deploy_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`, create specific rules that allow only the necessary commands:

    ```
    deploy_user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx.service, /usr/bin/systemctl restart puma.service, /usr/bin/rake db:migrate
    ```

    *   **Specify Full Paths:** Use full paths to commands (e.g., `/usr/bin/systemctl`) to avoid ambiguity and potential path hijacking vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limit to Specific Services/Commands:**  Clearly define the services or commands the deploy user is allowed to `sudo`.
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of wildcards in `sudoers` rules. Be as specific as possible.
    *   **`NOPASSWD` with Caution:**  Use `NOPASSWD` only for commands that are frequently executed and where password prompts would disrupt automation. Carefully consider the security implications of `NOPASSWD` and minimize its use.
    *   **User and Group Context:**  You can also specify `sudo` rules based on user or group context if needed for more complex scenarios.

*   **Testing `sudoers` Configuration:**  After modifying `sudoers`, thoroughly test the configuration to ensure it works as expected and doesn't inadvertently grant excessive permissions or block necessary commands. Use `sudo -l -U deploy_user` to list the commands the `deploy_user` is allowed to run via `sudo`.

#### 5.4. Consider Dedicated, Highly Restricted Deployment Users

For enhanced security, consider using dedicated deployment users with minimal system-level privileges, isolated from other system functionalities.

*   **Separate User Accounts:** Create a dedicated user account specifically for Capistrano deployments. Do not reuse existing user accounts that might have broader permissions or be used for other purposes.
*   **System User vs. Regular User:**  Consider creating a system user (e.g., with `adduser --system`) for deployment. System users typically have restricted shell access and are designed for automated processes.
*   **Minimal Shell Access:**  Restrict the deploy user's shell access. Consider using `nologin` or `rssh` to further limit what the user can do if they gain interactive shell access (though this is less relevant for automated deployments).
*   **Chroot Environment (Advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, you could explore using a chroot environment or containers to further isolate the deployment process and limit the deploy user's access to the underlying system.

#### 5.5. SSH Key Security Best Practices (Related Mitigation)

While not directly about user permissions, securing SSH keys is paramount to preventing deploy user compromise.

*   **Key Rotation:** Implement regular SSH key rotation for the deploy user.
*   **Key Storage Security:** Store private SSH keys securely. Avoid storing them in plain text or in easily accessible locations. Use SSH agents or password-protected key storage.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Keys:**  Ensure only authorized individuals have access to the private SSH keys used for deployment.
*   **Audit Key Usage:**  Monitor and audit the usage of deploy user SSH keys to detect any suspicious activity.
*   **Consider Short-Lived Keys:** Explore using short-lived SSH keys or certificate-based authentication for enhanced security and reduced risk of long-term key compromise.
