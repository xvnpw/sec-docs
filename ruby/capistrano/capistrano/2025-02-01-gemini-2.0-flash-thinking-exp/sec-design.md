```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to the Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
  - A webhook or trigger in the Version Control System initiates a build process in the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
  - The CI/CD system checks out the latest code from the Version Control System.
  - The CI/CD system builds the application, compiles code, packages dependencies, and creates build artifacts (e.g., deployable packages, containers).
  - Security scanners (SAST, linters, dependency vulnerability scanners) are run as part of the build process to identify potential security issues in the code and dependencies.
  - Build artifacts are published to an artifact repository (e.g., package registry, container registry).
  - The deployment process (using Capistrano) retrieves build artifacts from the artifact repository and deploys them to the target servers.

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated build process using CI/CD system to ensure consistency and repeatability.
  - security control: Version control of build scripts and configurations.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanners integrated into the build pipeline to detect code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Code linters and formatters to enforce code quality and security best practices.
  - security control: Secure artifact repository with access controls to protect build artifacts.
  - security control: Supply chain security measures to verify the integrity and authenticity of build tools and dependencies.
  - security control: Audit logging of build activities in the CI/CD system.
