# Threat Model Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Threat: [Compromised SSH Private Key](./threats/compromised_ssh_private_key.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the SSH private key used by Capistrano to connect to deployment servers. This could happen through various means like phishing, malware, or insecure storage of the key. Once compromised, the attacker can authenticate as the Capistrano user and execute arbitrary commands on the servers, including deploying malicious code or accessing sensitive data.
- **Impact:** Full server compromise, deployment of malicious application versions, data breaches, significant service disruption, and potential reputational damage.
- **Capistrano Component Affected:** SSH Key Authentication mechanism, `sshkit` gem (underlying SSH library).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Employ robust secrets management solutions to securely store and access SSH private keys.
    - Implement strict access control to the private key file using file system permissions and access control lists.
    - Regularly rotate SSH keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
    - Enforce the use of passphrase-protected SSH private keys with strong, complex passphrases.
    - Avoid storing private keys directly in version control systems or easily accessible locations.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing SSH Private Key Passphrase](./threats/weak_or_missing_ssh_private_key_passphrase.md)

- **Description:** SSH private keys used by Capistrano are not protected by a strong passphrase, or worse, have no passphrase at all. If an attacker gains access to the key file (even without root access initially), they can immediately use it to access deployment servers without needing to crack a passphrase.
- **Impact:** Significantly easier compromise of SSH private keys, leading to unauthorized server access, potential full server compromise, and deployment of malicious code.
- **Capistrano Component Affected:** SSH Key Authentication mechanism, `sshkit` gem.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Mandate and enforce the use of strong passphrases for all SSH private keys used with Capistrano.
    - Provide training and awareness to developers regarding the importance of strong SSH key passphrases.
    - Consider using SSH agent forwarding with caution and proper security considerations, or explore alternative secure key management methods that minimize passphrase entry frequency.

## Threat: [Insecure Capistrano Configuration Files](./threats/insecure_capistrano_configuration_files.md)

- **Description:** Capistrano configuration files (`deploy.rb`, stage files, etc.) are misconfigured and contain sensitive information hardcoded in plain text. This includes database credentials, API keys, or other secrets necessary for the application to function. An attacker gaining access to the codebase repository or the deployment server itself can easily extract these secrets.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to databases and external services, potential for lateral movement and further attacks using exposed credentials, and compromise of application data.
- **Capistrano Component Affected:** Configuration loading and parsing (`capistrano/core`, `capistrano/deploy`).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Never** hardcode sensitive information directly into Capistrano configuration files.
    - Utilize environment variables to inject sensitive configuration values at runtime.
    - Employ dedicated secrets management tools and Capistrano plugins (e.g., `capistrano-secrets`, `dotenv`) to securely manage and inject secrets into the deployment process.
    - Implement strict access control to configuration files within version control and on deployment servers.
    - Regularly audit configuration files to ensure no accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Malicious Deployment Scripts (Recipes)](./threats/malicious_deployment_scripts__recipes_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with malicious intent injects malicious code into Capistrano deployment scripts (recipes). This could occur through compromised developer accounts, supply chain attacks targeting Capistrano gems or plugins, or insider threats. When these compromised recipes are executed during deployment, the malicious code is deployed and executed on production servers.
- **Impact:** Deployment of backdoors, malware, or other malicious code onto production servers, complete compromise of the application and server infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption, and severe reputational damage.
- **Capistrano Component Affected:** Task execution engine (`capistrano/core`, `capistrano/deploy`, custom recipes).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement mandatory code review and security analysis for all Capistrano recipes and deployment scripts before they are used in production.
    - Secure the development environment and developer workstations to prevent unauthorized modification of deployment scripts.
    - Utilize version control for all deployment scripts and meticulously track changes and commits.
    - Consider implementing a system for signing or verifying deployment scripts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
    - Regularly audit and review deployment scripts for any suspicious or unexpected code changes.

## Threat: [Over-permissive Deploy User Permissions](./threats/over-permissive_deploy_user_permissions.md)

- **Description:** The user account used by Capistrano on the deployment servers is granted excessive privileges, such as unrestricted `sudo` access or root-level permissions. If this deploy user account is compromised (e.g., through SSH key compromise), the attacker inherits these excessive privileges, significantly amplifying the impact of the compromise.
- **Impact:** Increased severity of account compromise, potential for immediate root access on deployment servers, ability to perform actions far beyond deployment tasks, lateral movement to other systems within the infrastructure, and complete server takeover.
- **Capistrano Component Affected:** Server-side user context during task execution (`sshkit` user switching).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege when configuring the Capistrano deploy user account.
    - Grant only the absolute minimum permissions necessary for deployment tasks to function correctly.
    - Restrict `sudo` access for the deploy user to a very limited set of specific commands required for deployment using a carefully configured `sudoers` file.
    - Consider using dedicated, highly restricted deployment users with minimal system-level privileges, isolating them from other system functionalities.
