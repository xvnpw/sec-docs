# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Deployment Keys](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_deployment_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Deployment Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Dedicated Keys:** Generate new SSH key pairs specifically for Capistrano deployments. Do not reuse personal or administrative keys.
    2.  **Restrict User Accounts:**  On each target server, create or designate a user account with minimal necessary privileges for deployment tasks. Avoid using `root` or administrator accounts.
    3.  **Limit Key Permissions:** Configure the authorized keys file (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) for the deployment user to restrict the key's capabilities. Use `command="..."` option in `authorized_keys` to limit the commands executable via this key, if possible, though Capistrano's nature might make this complex. Focus on user-level permissions instead.
    4.  **File System Permissions:** Ensure the deployment user only has write access to the specific directories required for application deployment (e.g., release directories, shared directories) as managed by Capistrano.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** If a deployment key is compromised, an attacker with broad privileges could gain full control of the server *via Capistrano deployment user*. Least privilege limits the damage.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  Compromised keys with excessive permissions could be used to move laterally to other systems or escalate privileges within the compromised server *starting from the Capistrano deployment user context*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction in risk. Limits the scope of damage if a key is compromised *in the context of Capistrano deployments*.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium reduction in risk. Makes lateral movement more difficult as the compromised account *used by Capistrano* has limited permissions.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  [Specify if implemented and where. Example: Partially implemented. Dedicated keys are used, but user permissions on servers need review.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where implementation is missing. Example: Full review and restriction of user permissions for Capistrano deployment user on target servers is pending.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage and Management of Deployment Keys](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_and_management_of_deployment_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Storage and Management of Deployment Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Encrypted Storage:** Store private keys used by Capistrano on the deployment server or CI/CD pipeline in encrypted storage. Use tools like encrypted file systems or dedicated secrets management systems.
    2.  **Avoid Version Control:** Never commit private keys used by Capistrano directly to version control systems like Git.
    3.  **SSH Agent/Key Management:** Utilize SSH agents or key management tools (like `ssh-agent`, `keychain`) to handle key loading and access for Capistrano deployments. This avoids storing keys in plain text on disk for extended periods.
    4.  **Access Control for Key Storage:** Restrict access to the storage location of private keys used by Capistrano to only authorized personnel and processes involved in deployment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Exposure (High Severity):** If private keys used by Capistrano are stored insecurely (e.g., plain text, in version control), they are vulnerable to theft and misuse, potentially compromising *Capistrano deployments*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Deployment Infrastructure (High Severity):** Exposed keys grant direct access to deployment servers *via Capistrano*, bypassing other security measures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Exposure:** High reduction in risk. Encryption and secure storage significantly reduce the chance of key compromise *related to Capistrano*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Deployment Infrastructure:** High reduction in risk. Makes it much harder for attackers to obtain valid deployment credentials *for Capistrano*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where. Example: Implemented in CI/CD pipeline using encrypted secrets storage. Deployment server key storage for Capistrano needs review.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where implementation is missing. Example: Encryption of private keys used by Capistrano on the deployment server itself needs to be implemented.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Rotation of Deployment Keys](./mitigation_strategies/regular_rotation_of_deployment_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Rotation of Deployment Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Rotation Policy:** Define a schedule for rotating deployment SSH keys used by Capistrano (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    2.  **Automate Rotation Process:**  Develop scripts or use tools to automate the key rotation process for Capistrano. This includes generating new keys, distributing public keys to servers, and updating Capistrano configuration to use the new keys.
    3.  **Revoke Old Keys:** After rotation, immediately revoke and remove the old private keys from the deployment system and remove corresponding public keys from authorized servers *used by Capistrano*.
    4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to track key rotation schedules for Capistrano and alert administrators if rotations are missed or fail.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Key Persistence (Medium Severity):** Even if a Capistrano deployment key is compromised, regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for attackers to use it.
    *   **Insider Threat (Low to Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk from potentially compromised or disgruntled insiders who might have access to older Capistrano deployment keys.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Key Persistence:** Medium reduction in risk. Limits the lifespan of a compromised *Capistrano deployment* key.
    *   **Insider Threat:** Low to Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the value of older, potentially leaked *Capistrano deployment* keys.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where. Example: Not currently implemented. Key rotation for Capistrano is a manual process.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where implementation is missing. Example: Automation of key rotation for Capistrano and establishment of a rotation policy are missing.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Passphrase Protection for Private Keys](./mitigation_strategies/passphrase_protection_for_private_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Passphrase Protection for Private Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Passphrases:** Require strong passphrases for all private keys used by Capistrano.
    2.  **Secure Passphrase Management:**  Ensure passphrases are securely managed. Avoid storing them alongside keys in plain text. Use password managers or secure vaults if needed (though key management tools are generally preferred).
    3.  **Caution with SSH Agent Forwarding:** If using SSH agent forwarding with Capistrano, understand the security implications. While convenient, it can potentially expose your private key if the agent is compromised on the forwarded-to server. Consider alternatives if security is paramount for Capistrano deployments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Stolen Key Utility Reduction (Medium Severity):** If a private key file used by Capistrano is stolen, a strong passphrase makes it significantly harder for an attacker to use it without cracking the passphrase, hindering *Capistrano deployments*.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Low Severity):** Passphrases make brute-force attacks against stolen key files used by Capistrano much more time-consuming and less likely to succeed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Stolen Key Utility Reduction:** Medium reduction in risk. Adds a significant layer of protection to stolen key files *used by Capistrano*.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Low reduction in risk. Primarily a deterrent against less sophisticated attacks on *Capistrano deployment keys*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where. Example: Implemented. All Capistrano deployment keys are passphrase protected.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where implementation is missing. Example: Passphrase strength policy and enforcement for Capistrano deployment keys could be improved.]

    1.  **Code Review Configuration:** Regularly review `Capfile`, `deploy.rb`, and stage-specific configuration files for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities *within Capistrano setup*.
    2.  **Externalize Secrets:**  Never hardcode sensitive information (passwords, API keys, database credentials) directly in Capistrano configuration files.
    3.  **Environment Variables/Secrets Management:** Use environment variables or integrate with secure secrets management solutions (like Vault, Secrets Manager) to handle sensitive configuration *within Capistrano*.
    4.  **Version Control and Tracking:**  Store Capistrano configuration files in version control and track changes to maintain auditability and facilitate rollbacks *of Capistrano configurations*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Configuration (High Severity):** Hardcoded secrets in Capistrano configuration files are easily discoverable if the codebase is compromised or accidentally exposed, impacting *Capistrano deployments*.
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Misconfigurations in Capistrano deployment scripts can introduce vulnerabilities or weaken security measures *during deployments*.
*   **Impact:**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Use of `sudo` in Deployment Tasks
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Task Review:** Review all Capistrano tasks and identify instances where `sudo` is used.
    2.  **Least Privilege Design:** Redesign deployment processes and Capistrano tasks to operate with the least privileged user account necessary, avoiding `sudo` whenever possible.
    3.  **Restrict `sudo` Usage:** If `sudo` is unavoidable in certain Capistrano tasks, carefully audit and restrict its usage to specific commands and users within the `sudoers` configuration on target servers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Unnecessary use of `sudo` in Capistrano tasks increases the risk of privilege escalation if a vulnerability is exploited within the deployment process.
    *   **Accidental Damage (Medium Severity):**  Accidental or unintended commands executed with `sudo` in Capistrano tasks can cause significant system damage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High reduction in risk. Minimizing `sudo` reduces the attack surface for privilege escalation vulnerabilities in *Capistrano deployments*.
