## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Local Development Environment (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_local_development_environment__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

**1. Compromise Local Development Environment (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the developer's workstation as an initial entry point.
*   **Impact:** Successful compromise grants access to sensitive development resources, including SSH keys, Capistrano configurations, and potentially application source code. This can lead to full application and infrastructure compromise.
*   **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
    *   **1.1. Compromise Developer Machine (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **1.1.2. Phishing/Social Engineering (Credential Theft) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** Attackers use phishing emails, social media manipulation, or other social engineering tactics to trick developers into revealing their credentials (usernames, passwords, MFA codes).
            *   **Exploitation:** Stolen credentials can be used to access developer accounts, potentially granting access to SSH keys, code repositories, and other sensitive resources.
            *   **Mitigation:** Security Awareness Training, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Phishing Simulations.
    *   **1.2. Compromise Developer SSH Key (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **1.2.1. Key Theft from Compromised Machine (1.1) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** If a developer's machine is compromised (as in 1.1), attackers can steal stored SSH private keys.
            *   **Exploitation:** Stolen SSH keys can be used to directly authenticate to deployment servers, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms and Capistrano processes.
            *   **Mitigation:** Endpoint Security, Secure Key Storage, Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Regular Security Scans.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Deployment Server Infrastructure (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_deployment_server_infrastructure__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

**2. Compromise Deployment Server Infrastructure (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly target the deployment servers to exploit vulnerabilities in the server infrastructure itself.
*   **Impact:** Successful compromise grants direct control over the server, allowing attackers to manipulate the application, access data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
    *   **2.1. Exploit Server Vulnerabilities (OS, Services) (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **2.1.1. Unpatched Software (Outdated OS, SSH, Ruby, etc.) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software running on the deployment servers (operating system, SSH server, Ruby runtime, etc.).
            *   **Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation, and full server compromise.
            *   **Mitigation:** Regular Patching, Vulnerability Scanning, Automated Updates, Configuration Management.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Information Disclosure via Capistrano Logs/Output](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__information_disclosure_via_capistrano_logsoutput.md)

*   **3.2. Information Disclosure via Capistrano Logs/Output:**
    *   **3.2.1. Sensitive Data in Logs (Credentials, API Keys) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Capistrano logs or application logs generated during deployment inadvertently contain sensitive information like credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers who gain access to these logs (e.g., through misconfigured web servers, compromised accounts, or log aggregation systems) can extract sensitive data and use it for further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Log Sanitization, Secure Log Storage, Avoid Logging Sensitive Data, Access Control to Logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4. Insecure Handling of Secrets in Capistrano Configuration (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3_4__insecure_handling_of_secrets_in_capistrano_configuration__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

*   **3.4. Insecure Handling of Secrets in Capistrano Configuration (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers mishandle secrets within Capistrano configuration files or related processes, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of secrets (like database credentials, API keys, encryption keys) can lead to direct compromise of backend systems, data breaches, and unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
        *   **3.4.1. Hardcoded Secrets in `deploy.rb` or Task Files (Bad Practice) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** Developers directly embed secrets (passwords, API keys) as plain text within Capistrano configuration files (`deploy.rb`, custom tasks).
            *   **Exploitation:** If these files are accessible (e.g., through repository access, server access, or accidental exposure), attackers can easily retrieve the secrets.
            *   **Mitigation:** Avoid Hardcoded Secrets, Use Environment Variables, Secret Management Tools (e.g., `capistrano-secrets`, Vault), Configuration Management.
        *   **3.4.2. Secrets Stored in Version Control (Even Encrypted - Risk of Key Compromise) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** Developers store secrets in version control systems (like Git), even if they attempt to encrypt them. Encryption keys can be compromised or encryption might be weak.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers with access to the repository history can potentially decrypt or otherwise retrieve the secrets.
            *   **Mitigation:** Avoid Storing Secrets in Version Control, Use External Secret Management.
        *   **3.4.3. Secrets Exposed via Capistrano Configuration Files on Server (Permissions Issues) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Description:** Capistrano configuration files containing secrets (even if intended to be externalized) are deployed to the server with insecure file permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read them.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers who gain access to the server (even with limited privileges) can read these configuration files and extract secrets.
            *   **Mitigation:** Secure File Permissions on Server, Principle of Least Privilege, Configuration Management.
