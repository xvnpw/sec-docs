##### 1.1.2. Phishing/Social Engineering (Credential Theft) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH)

*   **Attack Description:** This is a highly prevalent and effective attack method. Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick developers into divulging their login credentials (usernames, passwords, MFA codes). Common tactics include:
    *   **Phishing Emails:** Crafting emails that appear to be legitimate communications from trusted sources (e.g., IT department, code repository platform, project management tools). These emails often contain links to fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Examples include:
        *   Emails impersonating GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, requesting password resets or urgent security updates.
        *   Emails disguised as notifications from project management tools like Jira or Asana, prompting developers to log in to view critical tasks.
        *   Emails mimicking internal IT support, requesting credentials for "system maintenance" or "security checks."
    *   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or groups within the development team, often leveraging publicly available information to personalize the attack and increase its credibility.
    *   **Social Media Manipulation:**  Using social media platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) to build rapport with developers and then subtly trick them into revealing information or clicking malicious links.
    *   **Watering Hole Attacks:** Compromising websites frequently visited by developers (e.g., developer forums, blogs, open-source project sites) to infect their machines with malware or redirect them to phishing pages.
    *   **Vishing (Voice Phishing):**  Using phone calls to impersonate trusted entities and trick developers into revealing credentials or sensitive information.
    *   **SMiShing (SMS Phishing):**  Using text messages to deliver phishing links or malicious instructions.
*   **Exploitation:** Once attackers successfully obtain developer credentials through phishing or social engineering, they can:
    *   **Access Developer Accounts:** Log in to corporate accounts, including email, code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), project management tools, and potentially cloud provider consoles.
    *   **Retrieve SSH Keys:** Access developer accounts to find stored SSH keys, often within repository settings or configuration files.
    *   **Bypass MFA (in some cases):**  Sophisticated phishing attacks can even attempt to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication by intercepting MFA codes in real-time or exploiting vulnerabilities in MFA implementations.
    *   **Gain Initial Foothold:** Use compromised accounts as a starting point for further reconnaissance and lateral movement within the development environment and potentially the wider corporate network.
*   **Mitigation:**  Effective mitigation requires a layered approach focusing on prevention, detection, and response:
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Regular and comprehensive training for all developers on:
        *   **Phishing Recognition:**  Identifying common phishing indicators (suspicious sender addresses, generic greetings, urgent language, mismatched links, requests for personal information).
        *   **Social Engineering Tactics:** Understanding various social engineering techniques and how to avoid falling victim to them.
        *   **Password Security Best Practices:**  Strong, unique passwords, password managers, and avoiding password reuse.
        *   **MFA Importance and Usage:**  Reinforcing the importance of MFA and proper usage of authentication apps or hardware tokens.
        *   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:**  Establishing clear procedures for reporting suspected phishing attempts or security incidents.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all developer accounts, especially those with access to sensitive resources like code repositories, cloud consoles, and VPNs.
        *   **Strong MFA Methods:** Prioritize stronger MFA methods like hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey) or authenticator apps over SMS-based OTP, which is more vulnerable to interception.
        *   **MFA Enforcement Policies:** Implement policies to ensure MFA is consistently enabled and used by all developers.
    *   **Phishing Simulations:**  Conduct regular phishing simulations to test developer awareness and identify areas for improvement in training.
        *   **Realistic Scenarios:**  Simulations should mimic real-world phishing attacks to effectively train developers.
        *   **Metrics and Reporting:** Track results of simulations to measure progress and identify individuals or teams needing additional training.
    *   **Email Security Measures:** Implement robust email security solutions:
        *   **Spam Filters:**  Effective spam filters to block known phishing emails.
        *   **Anti-Phishing Technologies:**  Utilize email security solutions with built-in anti-phishing capabilities, such as link scanning and sender authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
        *   **Email Security Gateways:**  Consider deploying email security gateways for advanced threat detection and prevention.
    *   **Endpoint Security Software:**  Deploy and maintain endpoint security software (Antivirus, Endpoint Detection and Response - EDR) on developer workstations to detect and prevent malware infections that could be delivered through phishing links or attachments.
    *   **Browser Security Extensions:** Encourage the use of browser security extensions that can help detect and block phishing websites.
    *   **Password Managers:** Promote the use of corporate-approved password managers to reduce password reuse and improve password strength.
    *   **Zero Trust Principles:** Implement Zero Trust principles, assuming that the network is always hostile and requiring strict verification for every access request, even from within the internal network.

#### 1.2. Compromise Developer SSH Key (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH)

*   **Attack Vector:** This sub-node focuses on the compromise of developer SSH private keys. SSH keys are critical for secure access to servers and are often used by Capistrano for automated deployments.
*   **Impact:**  Compromised SSH keys are extremely dangerous as they provide a direct and often silent backdoor into servers and infrastructure. The impact includes:
    *   **Direct Server Access:** Attackers can use stolen SSH keys to directly authenticate to servers, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms and Capistrano processes.
    *   **Bypass Capistrano Security:**  Stolen keys allow attackers to circumvent any security measures implemented within Capistrano itself, as they gain direct access at the SSH level.
    *   **Infrastructure Control:**  With SSH access, attackers can gain full control over servers, including deploying malicious code, modifying configurations, accessing sensitive data, and disrupting services.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised SSH keys can be used to move laterally across the infrastructure, potentially gaining access to other servers and systems.
    *   **Long-Term Persistence:**  SSH keys can provide persistent access, allowing attackers to maintain a foothold even after other vulnerabilities are patched.
*   **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:** This node focuses on how SSH keys can be compromised, with "Key Theft from Compromised Machine (1.1)" being a primary concern, directly linking back to the previous node of developer machine compromise.

##### 1.2.1. Key Theft from Compromised Machine (1.1) (HIGH RISK & HIGH RISK PATH)

*   **Attack Description:** This attack method directly leverages the successful compromise of a developer's machine (as described in 1.1). Once attackers have gained access to the developer's workstation, they can search for and steal stored SSH private keys. Common methods include:
    *   **File System Access:**  Searching the file system for common SSH key locations (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` - although `authorized_keys` is less valuable for attackers in this scenario).
    *   **Memory Dumping:**  Using memory dumping techniques to extract SSH keys that might be loaded in memory, especially if SSH agent is running.
    *   **Credential Harvesting Tools:**  Employing automated tools designed to search for and extract credentials, including SSH keys, from compromised systems.
    *   **Monitoring SSH Agent:**  If the developer is using an SSH agent, attackers might be able to intercept or hijack the agent to use the loaded keys.
*   **Exploitation:**  Once attackers steal SSH private keys, they can:
    *   **Directly Authenticate to Servers:** Use the stolen private keys to authenticate to servers configured to accept the corresponding public keys, typically servers used for Capistrano deployments.
    *   **Bypass Authentication Logs:**  Direct SSH key authentication might not always be as thoroughly logged or monitored as password-based authentication, potentially allowing attackers to operate more stealthily.
    *   **Automate Malicious Deployments:**  Use stolen keys to modify Capistrano configurations or scripts to deploy malicious code or backdoors to production environments.
    *   **Establish Backdoors:**  Create new user accounts or modify server configurations to establish persistent backdoors for future access.
*   **Mitigation:**  Protecting SSH keys requires a multi-faceted approach:
    *   **Endpoint Security:**  Robust endpoint security measures are crucial to prevent machine compromise in the first place (refer to mitigations in 1.1.2).
        *   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  EDR solutions can detect and respond to malicious activity on developer workstations, including attempts to access sensitive files like SSH keys.
        *   **Antivirus and Anti-Malware:**  Regularly updated antivirus and anti-malware software to prevent malware infections that could lead to key theft.
        *   **Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS):**  HIPS can monitor system activity and block suspicious actions, such as unauthorized access to SSH key files.
        *   **Personal Firewalls:**  Enable and properly configure personal firewalls on developer workstations to restrict unauthorized network access.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Implement secure methods for storing and managing SSH private keys:
        *   **Encrypted File Systems:**  Ensure developer workstations use full-disk encryption to protect data at rest, including SSH keys.
        *   **Encrypted SSH Key Storage:**  Consider using encrypted key storage solutions or password-protected SSH keys (although this adds complexity to automated deployments).
        *   **Key Management Tools:**  Explore using centralized key management tools or SSH certificate authorities to manage and distribute SSH keys more securely.
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or Secure Enclaves:**  For highly sensitive environments, consider using HSMs or secure enclaves to store SSH private keys in hardware-protected environments, making them much more difficult to extract.
    *   **SSH Agent Forwarding Restrictions:**  Carefully control SSH agent forwarding. Avoid forwarding agents unnecessarily, and consider using jump hosts or bastion servers to limit direct SSH access to production servers.
    *   **Regular Security Scans:**  Conduct regular security scans of developer workstations to identify vulnerabilities and malware infections that could lead to key theft.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners to identify and remediate software vulnerabilities on developer machines.
        *   **Malware Scans:**  Regularly scan for malware and rootkits.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant developers only the necessary permissions on their workstations and servers to minimize the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Key Rotation and Auditing:**  Implement SSH key rotation policies and audit SSH key usage to detect and respond to unauthorized access.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious SSH activity, such as logins from unusual locations or failed authentication attempts.

By thoroughly understanding this attack path and implementing the recommended mitigations, the development team can significantly strengthen the security of their Capistrano deployments and protect against the serious risks associated with compromised local development environments. This layered approach, combining technical controls with security awareness, is essential for building a robust and resilient security posture.
