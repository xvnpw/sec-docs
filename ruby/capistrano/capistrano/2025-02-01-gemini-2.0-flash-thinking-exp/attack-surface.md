# Attack Surface Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Deployment Machine](./attack_surfaces/compromised_deployment_machine.md)

*   **Description:** The machine running Capistrano is compromised, granting attackers access to deployment credentials, Capistrano configuration, and the ability to initiate deployments.
*   **Capistrano Contribution:** Capistrano's security is fundamentally tied to the security of the machine from which deployments are initiated. A compromised deployment machine directly undermines Capistrano's security posture.
*   **Example:** A developer's workstation running Capistrano is infected with ransomware. Attackers gain access to SSH keys stored for Capistrano deployments and threaten to deploy malicious code or disrupt services unless a ransom is paid.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of deployed application servers, data breaches, service disruption, malicious code injection, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of deployed applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Harden the Deployment Machine:** Implement robust security measures on the machine running Capistrano, including strong operating system security configurations, endpoint protection (antivirus/EDR), and regular security updates.
    *   **Dedicated Deployment Machine:** Use a dedicated, hardened build server specifically for Capistrano deployments instead of developer workstations. This isolates the deployment process and reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict access to the deployment machine to only authorized personnel and processes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit the security configuration and access controls of the deployment machine.

## Attack Surface: [Stolen or Compromised SSH Keys Used by Capistrano](./attack_surfaces/stolen_or_compromised_ssh_keys_used_by_capistrano.md)

*   **Description:** SSH private keys specifically used by Capistrano for authenticating to target servers are stolen, leaked, or otherwise compromised.
*   **Capistrano Contribution:** Capistrano relies heavily on SSH key-based authentication for automated, passwordless deployments. Compromised keys provide a direct and often undetectable path for unauthorized server access via Capistrano.
*   **Example:** An SSH private key used by Capistrano is accidentally committed to a public Git repository containing deployment scripts. Attackers discover the key and use it to directly access production servers, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized server access, ability to deploy malicious code through Capistrano, data breaches, service disruption, complete control over target servers and deployed applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure SSH Key Storage:** Store SSH private keys securely, ideally using encrypted key management systems or dedicated secret vaults. Avoid storing keys in plaintext or easily accessible locations on the deployment machine.
    *   **Access Control for SSH Keys:** Implement strict access controls to limit who can access and use the SSH keys used by Capistrano.
    *   **Regular SSH Key Rotation:** Periodically rotate SSH keys used for Capistrano deployments, generating new keys and revoking older ones to limit the window of opportunity for compromised keys.
    *   **Key Monitoring and Auditing:** Monitor the usage of SSH keys used by Capistrano for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Capistrano Tasks](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_capistrano_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** Custom Capistrano tasks, defined in `deploy.rb` or separate task files, contain security vulnerabilities such as command injection, insecure file handling, or improper input validation.
*   **Capistrano Contribution:** Capistrano's extensibility allows for custom tasks to automate deployment steps. However, poorly written custom tasks introduce vulnerabilities that are executed within the deployment context, potentially with elevated privileges on target servers.
*   **Example:** A custom Capistrano task designed to clear cache executes a shell command constructed by concatenating strings without proper escaping. An attacker could inject malicious commands into the cache clearing process, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server during deployment.
*   **Impact:** Command execution on servers with deployment user privileges, potential privilege escalation, data manipulation, service disruption, compromise of server and application integrity through malicious deployment tasks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices for Tasks:** Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom Capistrano tasks. Sanitize inputs, avoid command injection vulnerabilities by using parameterized commands or secure command execution methods, and perform thorough input validation.
    *   **Code Review for Custom Tasks:** Mandate code reviews for all custom Capistrano tasks by experienced developers with security awareness to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Tasks:** Design custom tasks to operate with the minimum necessary privileges on target servers. Avoid tasks running as root or with unnecessarily broad permissions.
    *   **Testing and Validation of Tasks:** Thoroughly test custom Capistrano tasks in non-production environments to identify and fix any security flaws or unintended behaviors before deploying to production.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets in Capistrano Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_in_capistrano_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, is inadvertently exposed within Capistrano configuration files (`Capfile`, `deploy.rb`, custom task files).
*   **Capistrano Contribution:** Capistrano configuration files are often part of the application codebase and may be version controlled. If secrets are hardcoded or improperly managed within these files, they become vulnerable to exposure through version control history, accidental leaks, or unauthorized access to the codebase.
*   **Example:** Database credentials for the production environment are hardcoded directly into `database.yml.erb` within the `deploy/` directory and committed to the application's Git repository. These credentials are then exposed to anyone with access to the repository history.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to databases or external services, potential compromise of application functionality, data breaches, and wider infrastructure compromise if exposed secrets grant access beyond the application itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Externalize Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets directly in Capistrano configuration files or any part of the codebase.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Utilize environment variables to manage secrets. Configure Capistrano to retrieve sensitive information from environment variables set on the deployment machine or target servers.
    *   **Secure Secret Management Solutions:** Integrate Capistrano with dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store, access, and manage secrets used during deployments.
    *   **Configuration File Security:** Ensure Capistrano configuration files are not publicly accessible in version control systems and implement appropriate access controls to limit who can view or modify them.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Capistrano and its Plugins](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_capistrano_and_its_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Capistrano itself, or its plugins, relies on vulnerable Ruby gems or other dependencies that have known security flaws.
*   **Capistrano Contribution:** Like any software, Capistrano and its ecosystem are built upon dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can introduce security risks into the deployment process and potentially the deployed applications if exploited during deployment tasks.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Ruby gem that is a dependency of a popular Capistrano plugin. Applications using this plugin with an outdated version of the gem become vulnerable to exploitation, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the deployment process or gain access to servers during deployment.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the deployment process, and in some cases, the deployed application servers if vulnerabilities are exploitable during deployment tasks, denial of service, and supply chain attacks targeting the deployment pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Capistrano and Plugins Updated:** Regularly update Capistrano and all its plugins to the latest versions. Security updates often include patches for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Capistrano's dependencies and plugins. Use dependency management tools (like Bundler) to ensure consistent and up-to-date dependencies and facilitate vulnerability patching.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Capistrano and its ecosystem to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation steps.
    *   **Vulnerability Remediation Plan:** Establish a clear process for promptly addressing and remediating any identified vulnerabilities in Capistrano or its dependencies.
