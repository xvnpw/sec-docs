### High and Critical Capistrano-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve Capistrano:

*   **Threat:** Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Capistrano configuration files (e.g., `deploy.rb`, `secrets.yml`) and discovers hardcoded sensitive information like SSH private keys, passwords, or API tokens. They can then use these credentials to access the deployment servers or other connected services. This directly leverages how Capistrano loads and uses configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of deployment servers, potential access to production databases and sensitive data, ability to deploy malicious code.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, specifically how `deploy.rb` and related files are parsed and used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize environment variables for sensitive information.
        *   Employ secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Capistrano.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information directly to version control.
        *   Use Capistrano's built-in features for handling secrets securely (e.g., `ask :password`).

*   **Threat:** Credentials Stored in Version Control
    *   **Description:** Even if not directly hardcoded, configuration files containing sensitive information (or files that decrypt sensitive information) are committed to a version control system. An attacker gaining access to the repository history can retrieve these credentials. This is a direct consequence of how Capistrano configuration is often managed alongside application code.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to hardcoded credentials, leading to server compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:**  Configuration file handling, interaction with the file system within the context of a Capistrano deployment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive configuration files from version control.
        *   Employ encrypted secrets management solutions where the decryption key is not stored in the repository.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the version control repository.
        *   Regularly audit the repository for accidentally committed secrets.

*   **Threat:** Compromised SSH Keys Used by Capistrano
    *   **Description:** The SSH private key used by Capistrano to connect to remote servers is compromised (e.g., stolen from a developer's machine or an insecure deployment server). An attacker can use this key to gain unauthorized access to the target servers. This directly impacts Capistrano's ability to perform deployments.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of deployment targets, ability to execute arbitrary commands, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:** SSH connection mechanism, specifically the use of SSH keys for authentication within Capistrano's deployment process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong passphrases for SSH keys.
        *   Store private keys securely and restrict access.
        *   Regularly rotate SSH keys.
        *   Consider using SSH certificate authorities for more granular access control.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication on systems where SSH keys are stored.

*   **Threat:** Execution of Unintended Commands via Capistrano Tasks
    *   **Description:**  A malicious actor with access to modify Capistrano tasks (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a vulnerability in the version control system) can inject commands that will be executed on the target servers during deployment. This directly abuses Capistrano's task execution functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on target servers, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:** Task execution mechanism, specifically how tasks are defined and executed on remote servers by Capistrano.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for Capistrano tasks.
        *   Restrict access to modify Capistrano configuration and task files.
        *   Use parameterized tasks where possible to limit the scope of user-provided input.
        *   Regularly audit Capistrano task definitions.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation During Deployment
    *   **Description:** Capistrano tasks might inadvertently or intentionally execute commands with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`) in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities or allows an attacker to gain higher privileges on the target server. This is a risk inherent in how Capistrano executes commands on remote systems.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to perform actions beyond the intended scope of deployment, potentially leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:** Task execution mechanism, specifically the use of `sudo` or other privilege escalation tools within tasks executed by Capistrano.
