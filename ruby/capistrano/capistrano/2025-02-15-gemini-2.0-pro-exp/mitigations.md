# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dedicated Deployment Keys (Limited Scope)](./mitigation_strategies/dedicated_deployment_keys__limited_scope_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate a New Key Pair:** Create a new SSH key pair specifically for Capistrano deployments.  Do *not* reuse an existing key.
    2.  **Restrict Key on Target Server (Capistrano's SSH Connection):**  On each target server, add the *public* key to the `authorized_keys` file of the user account Capistrano will connect as.
    3.  **Use `authorized_keys` Options (Critical for Capistrano):**  Use options within the `authorized_keys` file to restrict the key's usage:
        *   `command="/path/to/capistrano/wrapper production deploy"`: Limits the key to running *only* the specified Capistrano command (and a wrapper script).  This is a *direct* Capistrano-related security measure.
        *   `from="192.168.1.10"`: Restricts connections to the deployment server's IP address.
        *   `no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty`: Disable unnecessary SSH features.
    4.  **Secure Private Key:** Store the *private* key securely, accessible only to the Capistrano user.
    5.  **Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating the deployment keys.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Deployment Server (High Severity):** Limits the attacker's actions to the specific Capistrano command, preventing arbitrary command execution on target servers.
    *   **Key Theft (High Severity):** Restricts the key's use even if stolen.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Deployment Server/Key Theft:** Significantly reduces impact; attacker cannot gain a full shell or execute arbitrary commands. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dedicated key pair exists; public key added to `authorized_keys`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `authorized_keys` options (`command`, `from`, etc.) are *not* used. The key has full shell access.
    *   Key rotation process is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management (Capistrano Config Files)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management__capistrano_config_files_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets:** List all sensitive data used in your Capistrano deployment.
    2.  **Choose a Secrets Management Solution:** Select a secure method (environment variables, secrets manager).
    3.  **Configure Capistrano (Crucial Step):** Modify your Capistrano configuration files (`deploy.rb`, stage files) to *retrieve* secrets from your chosen solution.  *Never* hardcode secrets in these files.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use `ENV['SECRET_NAME']` within Capistrano tasks.
        *   **Secrets Management Service:** Use the service's client library within custom Capistrano tasks to fetch secrets.  This is a *direct* modification to Capistrano's configuration.
    4.  **Restrict Access:** Ensure only necessary users/processes can access secrets.
    5. **Regularly audit secrets:** Periodically review your secrets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server (High Severity):** Attackers won't find hardcoded secrets in configuration files.
    *   **Compromised Version Control (High Severity):** Secrets are not stored in version control.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of accidental exposure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server/Version Control:** Significantly reduces impact; attackers cannot easily obtain credentials. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure:** Prevents accidental exposure. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Environment variables used for some secrets.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some API keys are hardcoded in Capistrano configuration files.
    *   A centralized secrets management solution is not used.
    *   Access control to environment variables is not strictly enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rollback Capability (Using Capistrano's `deploy:rollback`)](./mitigation_strategies/rollback_capability__using_capistrano's__deployrollback__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand `deploy:rollback`:** Familiarize yourself with Capistrano's built-in `deploy:rollback` task. This is a *core Capistrano feature*.
    2.  **Test Rollbacks Regularly:** Test the `deploy:rollback` procedure in a staging environment.
    3.  **Identify Limitations:** Understand that `deploy:rollback` only reverts code, not database migrations.
    4.  **Plan for Database Rollbacks:** Develop a separate procedure for database rollbacks (may involve custom Capistrano tasks or external tools).
    5.  **Document:** Clearly document the rollback process.
    6. **Monitor deployments:** Monitor deployments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deployment Introduces Vulnerability (High Severity):** Allows quick reversion to a known-good state.
    *   **Deployment Breaks Functionality (High Severity):** Allows quick service restoration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deployment Introduces Vulnerability/Breaks Functionality:** Minimizes downtime and exposure. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `deploy:rollback` task is available.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rollbacks are not regularly tested.
    *   Documented procedure for database rollbacks is missing.
    *   Real-time monitoring is not consistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimal Shared Resources (Capistrano's `linked_files` and `linked_dirs`)](./mitigation_strategies/minimal_shared_resources__capistrano's__linked_files__and__linked_dirs__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` (Capistrano Settings):** Carefully review these settings in your Capistrano configuration. These are *core Capistrano settings*.
    2.  **Minimize Shared Resources:** Share *only* the absolute minimum necessary files and directories. Avoid sharing sensitive files or writable directories.
    3.  **Prefer Read-Only Links:** If linking configuration files, make them read-only by the application.
    4.  **Consider Alternatives:** Explore alternatives to shared resources (e.g., generating config files during deployment).
    5. **Regularly audit:** Periodically review.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server (Medium Severity):** Limits attacker's ability to modify shared files for persistence.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of exploiting vulnerabilities to modify shared files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server/Privilege Escalation:** Reduces impact by limiting persistence/escalation. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review of settings hasn't been conducted recently.
    *   Some linked files are not read-only.
    *   Alternatives have not been fully explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review (Capistrano Configuration Files)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review__capistrano_configuration_files_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat Configuration as Code:** Capistrano configuration files are as important as application code.
    2.  **Include in Code Review:** Make Capistrano configuration changes part of your code review process. This directly impacts how Capistrano is used.
    3.  **Focus on Security:** During review, look for:
        *   Hardcoded secrets.
        *   Overly permissive permissions.
        *   Unnecessary `sudo`.
        *   Injection vulnerabilities in custom tasks.
        *   Insecure shared resources.
    4.  **Document:** Document the review process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Capistrano Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Catches security mistakes in Capistrano configuration.
    *   **Malicious Insider (Low Severity):** Reduces risk of insider threats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Capistrano Configuration Errors:** Reduces risk of vulnerabilities due to configuration mistakes. Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Malicious Insider:** Provides a layer of defense. Risk reduction: Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Capistrano configuration files are *sometimes* reviewed, but not consistently or with a security focus.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal requirement for code review of *all* Capistrano configuration changes is missing.
    *   Review process doesn't explicitly include a security checklist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `sudo` (Within Capistrano Tasks)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__sudo___within_capistrano_tasks_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid running commands as root within Capistrano tasks unless absolutely necessary. This is a *direct* instruction on how to write Capistrano tasks.
    2.  **Review Existing Tasks:** Review all Capistrano tasks that use `sudo`.
    3.  **Identify Alternatives:** Explore alternatives that don't require root privileges.
    4.  **Restrict `sudoers` (If Unavoidable):** If `sudo` is essential, use the `sudoers` file to grant *only* the specific commands needed to the Capistrano user.
    5.  **Document:** Document any remaining `sudo` usage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server (High Severity):** Limits attacker's ability to escalate privileges.
    *   **Accidental Damage (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of accidental damage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Target Server:** Reduces impact; attacker's ability to gain root is limited. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Accidental Damage:** Reduces scope of potential damage. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some Capistrano tasks use `sudo` without justification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review of `sudo` usage hasn't been conducted.
    *   Alternatives to `sudo` haven't been fully explored.
    *   `sudoers` configuration is not restrictive enough.
