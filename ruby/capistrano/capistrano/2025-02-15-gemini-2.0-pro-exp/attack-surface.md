# Attack Surface Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Attack Surface: [Leaked SSH Keys or Credentials](./attack_surfaces/leaked_ssh_keys_or_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The SSH private key or other credentials used by Capistrano to access target servers are exposed or stolen.
*   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano *requires* credentials (typically SSH keys) to connect to and manage target servers. This is a core function, and leaked credentials grant direct access via Capistrano's intended mechanism.
*   **Example:** An SSH private key is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository, allowing anyone to connect to the servers Capistrano manages *using Capistrano*.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the target servers, allowing deployment of malicious code, data theft, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** store SSH keys or passwords in the Capistrano configuration or repository.
    *   Use an SSH agent with proper security configurations.
    *   Employ a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Doppler) to securely store and inject credentials *only* during deployment. Do not rely solely on environment variables.
    *   Rotate SSH keys regularly.
    *   Use short-lived credentials (e.g., temporary cloud provider tokens) whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive SSH User Privileges](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_ssh_user_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** The SSH user configured for Capistrano has excessive privileges on the target servers (e.g., root access or overly broad `sudo` permissions).
*   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano executes commands on the target servers *via* the configured SSH user. The privileges of this user directly determine what Capistrano *can* do. This is a fundamental aspect of how Capistrano operates.
*   **Example:** Capistrano is configured to use the `root` user. A compromised deployment machine allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as `root` on all target servers *through Capistrano*.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the target servers, enabling any action the attacker desires.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a dedicated, *non-root* user for Capistrano deployments.
    *   Grant this user *only* the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., write access to the deployment directory, permission to restart the application).
    *   Configure `sudo` *very* restrictively, allowing only specific commands required for deployment and executed by Capistrano. Avoid granting blanket `sudo` access.
    *   Consider using `chroot` or containerization to further isolate the deployment process on the target servers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure `deploy.rb` and Custom Tasks](./attack_surfaces/insecure__deploy_rb__and_custom_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** The `deploy.rb` file or custom Capistrano tasks contain vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, insecure handling of user input).
*   **How Capistrano Contributes:** These files *are* the Capistrano deployment logic. They define the actions Capistrano takes. Vulnerabilities here are vulnerabilities *within* Capistrano's execution.
*   **Example:** A custom task uses unsanitized user input in a shell command executed *by Capistrano*, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the target servers, potentially with the privileges of the Capistrano user, all happening *through* Capistrano's defined workflow.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and audit the `deploy.rb` file and all custom tasks for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly in shell commands. Use Capistrano's built-in functions for escaping and sanitizing input.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing Capistrano tasks (e.g., avoid shell injection, validate input).
    *   Use a linter or static analysis tool for Ruby code to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Rollback to Vulnerable Versions](./attack_surfaces/rollback_to_vulnerable_versions.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker manipulates Capistrano's release management to force a rollback to a known vulnerable version of the application.
*   **How Capistrano Contributes:** Capistrano *provides* the rollback functionality and manages the release directories and symlinks. This is a direct attack on Capistrano's release management system.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `releases` directory and modifies the `current` symlink (managed *by Capistrano*) to point to an older, vulnerable release.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to known exploits that were patched in later releases.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure strict permissions on the `releases` directory and its contents, preventing unauthorized modification. This directly protects Capistrano's data.
    *   Monitor the integrity of the `releases` directory and symlinks (which are managed by Capistrano).
    *   Consider digitally signing releases to prevent tampering.
    *   Limit the number of old releases kept on the server (a Capistrano configuration setting).

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Webhooks (if used)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_webhooks__if_used_.md)

* **Description:** Capistrano deployments are triggered by unsecured webhooks, allowing unauthorized deployments.
* **How Capistrano Contributes:** If Capistrano is *configured* to be triggered by webhooks, then those webhooks become a direct entry point to initiate Capistrano deployments.
* **Example:** A webhook endpoint designed to trigger Capistrano is exposed without authentication, allowing anyone to trigger a deployment.
* **Impact:** Deployment of malicious or unauthorized code *via Capistrano*.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the authenticity of webhook requests using signatures or other authentication mechanisms provided by the webhook provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This ensures only authorized sources can trigger Capistrano.
    *   Restrict access to the webhook endpoint to authorized sources (e.g., using IP whitelisting).
