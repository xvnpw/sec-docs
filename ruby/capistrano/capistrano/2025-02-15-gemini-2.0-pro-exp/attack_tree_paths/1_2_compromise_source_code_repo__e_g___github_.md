Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on a Capistrano-deployed application, presented as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Compromise Source Code Repo (e.g., GitHub)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify and evaluate the specific threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts associated with compromising the source code repository (specifically GitHub in this case, but principles apply to GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) of an application deployed using Capistrano.  We aim to understand how an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the repository and what the consequences would be for the application and its infrastructure.  This analysis will inform recommendations for mitigating these risks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path "1.2 Compromise Source Code Repo (e.g., GitHub)."  It considers:

*   **Target:**  The GitHub repository hosting the source code of the Capistrano-deployed application.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We will consider various attacker profiles, ranging from opportunistic attackers with limited resources to sophisticated, targeted attackers (e.g., nation-state actors, competitors).
*   **Capistrano Relevance:**  We will specifically analyze how Capistrano's deployment process and configuration might be affected by or contribute to the vulnerabilities related to a compromised source code repository.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis does *not* cover attacks on the deployed application itself (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) *unless* they are a direct consequence of the repository compromise.  It also does not cover physical security of GitHub's infrastructure.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threat actors and their motivations for compromising the source code repository.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access to the GitHub repository.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful repository compromise, considering the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to reduce the likelihood and impact of a repository compromise.
5.  **Capistrano-Specific Considerations:**  Analyze how Capistrano's features and configurations can be leveraged to both mitigate and exacerbate the risks.
