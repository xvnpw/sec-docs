# Threat Model Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Threat: [Unauthorized Code Deployment via Compromised Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_code_deployment_via_compromised_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to SSH keys or other credentials used *by Capistrano* (stored on the deployment machine or within a CI/CD system that directly interacts with Capistrano) and uses them to initiate a deployment of malicious code by directly executing `cap` commands. This is distinct from compromising the *repository*; the attacker is using Capistrano's intended functionality maliciously.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data exfiltration, service disruption, potential lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:**  `SSHKit` (underlying SSH library), Capistrano's task execution mechanism (e.g., `invoke`), deployment scripts (e.g., `deploy.rb`) that are *executed by Capistrano*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure SSH Key Management:** Use a secrets management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). Avoid storing keys directly on disk where Capistrano runs.
        *   **Short-Lived SSH Certificates:** Implement short-lived SSH certificates for Capistrano's SSH connections.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for SSH access to target servers, specifically for the user account Capistrano uses.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Harden the CI/CD server and build agents *that execute Capistrano commands*. Restrict network access.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the deployment user *used by Capistrano* has minimal necessary permissions on target servers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Rollback to a Vulnerable Version (via Capistrano)](./threats/unauthorized_rollback_to_a_vulnerable_version__via_capistrano_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (or a legitimate user making a mistake) uses Capistrano's *built-in* rollback functionality (`cap production deploy:rollback`) to revert to an older release known to contain vulnerabilities. The attacker is leveraging Capistrano's own features.
    *   **Impact:**  Re-introduction of known vulnerabilities, making the application exploitable.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:**  `deploy:rollback` task, Capistrano's release management (specifically, the symlinking to older releases *managed by Capistrano*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rollback Restrictions:** Limit who can execute the `deploy:rollback` task. Require approval for rollbacks via access controls on the deployment machine or CI/CD system.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Old Releases:**  Periodically scan older releases *managed by Capistrano* and remove/patch vulnerable ones (this is a process outside of Capistrano, but mitigates a Capistrano-specific threat).
        *   **Audit Rollback Actions:** Log all rollback operations initiated *through Capistrano*, including who initiated them.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Shared Files and Directories (via Capistrano's Misconfiguration)](./threats/manipulation_of_shared_files_and_directories__via_capistrano's_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *misconfiguration within Capistrano itself* related to the handling of `shared` files and directories. This could be due to overly permissive `linked_files` or `linked_dirs` settings, or custom tasks that incorrectly handle shared resources. The vulnerability lies in *how Capistrano is configured to manage these resources*, not in the resources themselves.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, log manipulation, potential privilege escalation, application instability.
    *   **Affected Capistrano Component:**  `deploy:check`, `deploy:symlink:shared` tasks, Capistrano's handling of the `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` configuration *within the Capistrano configuration files*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:**  The Capistrano deployment user should have minimal permissions on the `shared` directory. This is a general mitigation, but it's crucial in the context of Capistrano's shared resource management.
        *   **Careful `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` Configuration:**  Be extremely precise and restrictive when defining `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` in your Capistrano configuration. Avoid linking anything unnecessary.
        *   **Review Custom Tasks:** If you have custom Capistrano tasks that interact with the `shared` directory, thoroughly review them for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement checks (potentially as custom Capistrano tasks) to validate that the `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` settings are not overly permissive.
