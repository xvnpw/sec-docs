## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Capistrano Deployment Process [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_capistrano_deployment_process__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch focuses on attacks that target the deployment process itself, aiming to inject malicious code or gain control over the servers before or during deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Compromise Source Code Repo (e.g., GitHub)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_compromise_source_code_repo__e_g___github_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  Attacks targeting the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to gain control over the application's codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Gain Unauthorized Access to Repo {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_gain_unauthorized_access_to_repo_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to the source code repository through various means.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Credential theft (phishing, malware, credential stuffing).
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository hosting platform.
    *   Social engineering to trick authorized users.
    *   Brute-forcing weak passwords.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Mandatory strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA).
    *   Principle of least privilege for repository access.
    *   Regular security audits of user accounts and permissions.
    *   Monitoring for suspicious login activity.
    *   Employee security awareness training.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Inject Malicious Code into Repo [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_inject_malicious_code_into_repo__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  After gaining access, the attacker modifies the codebase to include malicious code that will be executed during deployment.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Directly committing malicious code.
    *   Creating a pull request with malicious changes.
    *   Modifying existing build scripts or configuration files.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Mandatory code reviews by multiple developers.
    *   Branch protection rules (requiring approvals, status checks).
    *   Static code analysis (SAST) to detect vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency scanning to identify vulnerable libraries.
    *   Automated security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Compromise Deployment Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_compromise_deployment_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Attacks targeting the credentials used by Capistrano to connect to and manage the target servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Steal SSH Keys/Passwords {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_steal_ssh_keyspasswords_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker obtains the SSH keys or passwords used for deployment.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Phishing attacks targeting developers or operations personnel.
    *   Malware on developer workstations or deployment machines.
    *   Compromising servers where credentials might be stored insecurely.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in secrets management systems (if misconfigured).
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Secure storage of SSH keys (hardware security modules, encrypted key agents).
    *   Use of a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    *   Avoid storing credentials in plain text or in the code repository.
    *   Regular rotation of SSH keys.
    *   Employee security awareness training.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Brute-Force SSH Keys/Passwords [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_brute-force_ssh_keyspasswords__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to guess the SSH key passphrase or password through repeated attempts.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Using automated brute-force tools.
    *   Dictionary attacks using common passwords.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Disable password-based SSH authentication entirely.
    *   Enforce strong, randomly generated SSH key passphrases.
    *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies on SSH login attempts (e.g., using `fail2ban`).
    *   Monitor for failed login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Abuse Capistrano Features/Tasks (Unsafe Practices) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_abuse_capistrano_featurestasks__unsafe_practices___high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch focuses on exploiting insecure coding practices within the Capistrano configuration itself, specifically related to command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1.1 Use `execute` with user-supplied input unsafely [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_1_use__execute__with_user-supplied_input_unsafely__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a command injection vulnerability where user-provided input is directly incorporated into a shell command executed via Capistrano's `execute` method.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Crafting malicious input that includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&&`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$()`) to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Avoid using user input directly in `execute` commands whenever possible.**
    *   **If user input is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate it.** Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters) rather than blacklisting (trying to block known-bad characters).
    *   **Consider using parameterized commands or APIs instead of constructing shell commands.** This is the most secure approach.
    *   **Escape user input appropriately for the target shell.**  Use shell escaping functions provided by your programming language or framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1.2 Use `run_locally` with user-supplied input unsafely [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_2_use__run_locally__with_user-supplied_input_unsafely__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:**  Identical to 2.3.1.1, but the command injection occurs on the machine running Capistrano (the deployment machine), not the target server. This can still lead to RCE on the deployment machine and potentially lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Methods:** Same as 2.3.1.1.
*   **Mitigations:** Same as 2.3.1.1.
