# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for capistrano/capistrano

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rotate Deployment Keys Regularly](./mitigation_strategies/rotate_deployment_keys_regularly.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Key Rotation Policy:** Define a schedule for rotating SSH deployment keys used by Capistrano (e.g., every 3-6 months).
    2.  **Generate New Key Pair:** Create a new SSH key pair specifically for Capistrano deployments.
    3.  **Update Capistrano Configuration:** Replace the old private key path in your Capistrano configuration files (`deploy.rb`, `config/deploy.rb`, or similar) with the path to the new private key.
    4.  **Distribute New Public Key:**  Add the new public key to the `authorized_keys` file on all deployment servers for the deployment user that Capistrano uses.
    5.  **Revoke Old Public Key:** Remove the old public key from the `authorized_keys` file on all deployment servers.
    6.  **Securely Archive Old Key:**  Store the old private key securely for audit purposes or potential rollback scenarios, but ensure it is not actively used by Capistrano.
    7.  **Document Rotation Process:**  Document the key rotation process for future reference and consistency in Capistrano deployment procedures.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Deployment Key (High Severity):** If a deployment key used by Capistrano is stolen or leaked, attackers can gain unauthorized access to deployment servers and potentially deploy malicious code or exfiltrate data via Capistrano's deployment mechanisms.
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):**  Regular rotation reduces the risk if a disgruntled employee or contractor with access to Capistrano deployment keys leaves the organization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Deployment Key: High Impact Reduction:** Significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers using a compromised Capistrano deployment key.
    *   **Insider Threat: Medium Impact Reduction:** Limits the lifespan of access for individuals who might become malicious and have access to Capistrano keys.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Key rotation is documented in the security policy document located in `docs/security_policy.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated key rotation process for Capistrano keys is missing. Currently, key rotation is a manual process performed by the DevOps team, impacting consistent and timely rotation for Capistrano keys specifically. Scripting and automation within the Capistrano deployment workflow are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Dedicated Deployment Keys for Capistrano](./mitigation_strategies/use_dedicated_deployment_keys_for_capistrano.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Dedicated Key:** Create a new SSH key pair specifically for Capistrano deployments. Name it descriptively (e.g., `capistrano_deploy_key`).
    2.  **Configure Capistrano to Use Dedicated Key:**  Ensure Capistrano is configured to exclusively use this dedicated key for all deployment operations. This is configured in `deploy.rb` or `config/deploy.rb` using the `ssh_options` setting.
    3.  **Restrict Key Usage:**  Ensure this key is *only* used by Capistrano and not for any other purpose (e.g., personal access, server administration).
    4.  **Separate from Personal Keys:**  Store the dedicated Capistrano deployment key separately from personal SSH keys to prevent accidental misuse or confusion within the Capistrano deployment context.
    5.  **Document Key Purpose:** Clearly document the purpose of this key as being solely for Capistrano deployments in deployment guides and Capistrano configuration documentation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Misuse in Capistrano Context (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of accidentally using a deployment key intended for Capistrano for unintended purposes within the deployment process, potentially granting broader access than necessary through Capistrano.
    *   **Blast Radius Reduction (Medium Severity):** If a dedicated Capistrano deployment key is compromised, the impact is limited to deployment activities managed by Capistrano, rather than potentially broader system access if a personal key was used for Capistrano deployments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Misuse in Capistrano Context: Medium Impact Reduction:** Makes it less likely for the Capistrano deployment key to be used for unintended purposes within deployment workflows.
    *   **Blast Radius Reduction: Medium Impact Reduction:** Limits the potential damage if the dedicated Capistrano deployment key is compromised, specifically within the scope of Capistrano operations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented. A dedicated `capistrano_deploy_key` is generated and configured within `config/deploy.rb` to be used by Capistrano for deployments. This is documented in the deployment guide in `docs/deployment_guide.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforcement mechanism to prevent developers from using the dedicated Capistrano deployment key for other SSH access outside of Capistrano workflows is missing. Training and awareness programs are needed to reinforce proper key usage specifically in relation to Capistrano.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store Deployment Keys Used by Capistrano](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_deployment_keys_used_by_capistrano.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Version Control Storage:** Never commit private deployment keys used by Capistrano directly to version control repositories, especially within Capistrano configuration files.
    2.  **Encrypted Storage for Capistrano Keys:** Store private keys used by Capistrano in encrypted storage. Options include:
        *   **Encrypted Configuration Files:** Encrypt Capistrano configuration files containing the private key path using tools like `ansible-vault` or `blackbox`.
        *   **Secrets Management Tools:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve keys for Capistrano deployments. Capistrano can be configured to integrate with these tools.
        *   **Encrypted File Systems:** Store keys on encrypted file systems on developer workstations or build servers used for Capistrano deployments.
    3.  **Access Control for Capistrano Key Storage:** Restrict access to the storage location of private keys used by Capistrano to only authorized personnel and systems involved in the Capistrano deployment process.
    4.  **Regular Audits of Capistrano Key Access:** Periodically audit access to key storage locations to ensure only authorized access is occurring in the context of Capistrano key management.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Exposure in Version Control (Critical Severity):**  Accidental or intentional commit of private keys used by Capistrano to version control exposes them to anyone with repository access, including potential external attackers who could then leverage Capistrano for malicious deployments.
    *   **Unauthorized Key Access (High Severity):**  If keys used by Capistrano are not securely stored, unauthorized individuals could gain access to them and compromise deployment processes managed by Capistrano.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Exposure in Version Control: Critical Impact Reduction:** Prevents accidental exposure of Capistrano keys in version control, a major security vulnerability in the Capistrano deployment pipeline.
    *   **Unauthorized Key Access: High Impact Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to Capistrano deployment keys, securing the deployment process.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Private keys are not committed to version control (verified by `.gitignore` rules in the repository root). Keys used by Capistrano are currently stored as encrypted environment variables in the CI/CD pipeline configuration used for Capistrano deployments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Migration to a dedicated secrets management tool like Vault for managing Capistrano keys is missing.  Current environment variable storage is less robust and harder to manage at scale compared to a dedicated secrets management solution for securing Capistrano deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Key Permissions for Capistrano Deployment Keys](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_key_permissions_for_capistrano_deployment_keys.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Capistrano Keys:** Grant the deployment key used by Capistrano only the minimum necessary permissions required for Capistrano deployments.
    2.  **Limited User Account for Capistrano:** Configure Capistrano to deploy using a dedicated deployment user on target servers with restricted privileges. This user should not have root or sudo access unless absolutely necessary for specific Capistrano deployment tasks. This is configured in `deploy.rb` using the `user` setting.
    3.  **File System Permissions Managed by Capistrano:**  Utilize Capistrano tasks to set appropriate file system permissions on deployed files and directories to limit access to the deployment user and web server user. Ensure Capistrano tasks correctly implement secure permissions.
    4.  **Command Restrictions (if applicable):** If possible, further restrict the commands the deployment key used by Capistrano can execute on the server using SSH authorized keys options (e.g., `command=`, `restrict`). This is more complex to implement with Capistrano's dynamic command execution but should be explored for enhanced security.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Capistrano Key (High Severity):**  If the deployment key used by Capistrano has excessive permissions, attackers who compromise it could potentially escalate privileges and gain full control of the server through Capistrano's deployment capabilities.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Capistrano Deployment User (Medium Severity):**  Overly permissive keys used by Capistrano could allow attackers to move laterally to other systems or resources accessible with the same key, starting from a compromised Capistrano deployment.
    *   **Accidental Damage via Capistrano (Medium Severity):**  Restricting permissions for the Capistrano deployment user and key reduces the risk of accidental damage to the system due to misconfigured Capistrano deployment scripts or tasks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Capistrano Key: High Impact Reduction:** Limits the potential for privilege escalation if the Capistrano deployment key is compromised.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Capistrano Deployment User: Medium Impact Reduction:** Reduces the potential for lateral movement to other systems originating from a compromised Capistrano deployment user.
    *   **Accidental Damage via Capistrano: Medium Impact Reduction:** Minimizes the risk of accidental system damage caused by Capistrano deployments due to overly broad permissions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Capistrano deploys using a dedicated user (`deploy`) configured in `deploy.rb`, which does not have root access. File system permissions are set during Capistrano deployment tasks using `chmod` and `chown` tasks defined in `deploy.rb` and custom tasks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Further restriction of the deployment user's permissions within the server environment, specifically for Capistrano operations, is missing.  Reviewing and refining Capistrano tasks to ensure they adhere to least privilege principles and exploring more granular file system permissions managed by Capistrano could enhance security. Command restrictions via SSH authorized keys options for Capistrano keys are not currently implemented and require further investigation for compatibility with Capistrano's workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Externalize Sensitive Configuration Used by Capistrano](./mitigation_strategies/externalize_sensitive_configuration_used_by_capistrano.md)

*   **Description:**

    2.  **Externalize Configuration:** Remove hardcoded sensitive information from Capistrano configuration files.
    3.  **Utilize Environment Variables in Capistrano:**  Configure Capistrano to retrieve sensitive configuration from environment variables on the deployment server. Capistrano provides mechanisms to access environment variables within tasks and configuration.
    4.  **Secrets Management Integration with Capistrano:** Integrate Capistrano with dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager). Develop Capistrano tasks or plugins to retrieve secrets from these tools during deployment.
    5.  **Document Externalization:** Document the method used for externalizing sensitive configuration for Capistrano deployments.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control (Critical Severity):**  Hardcoding secrets in Capistrano configuration files and committing them to version control exposes them to anyone with repository access.
    *   **Configuration Drift and Inconsistency (Medium Severity):**  Hardcoding secrets in configuration files can lead to inconsistencies between environments and make secret rotation and management more complex within Capistrano deployments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control: Critical Impact Reduction:** Prevents accidental exposure of secrets in version control through Capistrano configuration.
    *   **Configuration Drift and Inconsistency: Medium Impact Reduction:** Improves consistency and simplifies secret management for Capistrano deployments across different environments.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for some sensitive configurations in Capistrano, particularly database credentials. This is documented in `docs/deployment_guide.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive externalization of *all* sensitive configuration used by Capistrano is missing.  Integration with a dedicated secrets management tool for Capistrano deployments is not yet implemented.  A systematic review of all Capistrano configuration and tasks is needed to identify and externalize all remaining hardcoded secrets.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  The DevOps team manually checks for updates to Capistrano and gems periodically, documented in the maintenance schedule in `docs/maintenance_schedule.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency update process for Capistrano and its gems is missing.  Implementing tools like Dependabot or Renovate would automate vulnerability scanning and update suggestions, improving the timeliness and consistency of updates for Capistrano and its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Gem Dependencies Used by Capistrano](./mitigation_strategies/audit_gem_dependencies_used_by_capistrano.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Audit Gems:** Implement a process to regularly audit the Ruby gem dependencies used by Capistrano (defined in `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`) for known security vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Use `bundle audit`:** Utilize the `bundle audit` gem to scan the project's gem dependencies for vulnerabilities. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline or run it as a scheduled task.
    3.  **Address Vulnerabilities:**  Promptly address any vulnerabilities identified by `bundle audit`. This may involve updating gems, patching vulnerabilities, or removing vulnerable dependencies if alternatives exist.
    4.  **Document Audit Process:** Document the gem auditing process and remediation steps.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Gem Dependencies (High Severity):** Vulnerable gem dependencies used by Capistrano can introduce security flaws that attackers could exploit during the deployment process or in the deployed application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Gem Dependencies: High Impact Reduction:** Proactively identifies and mitigates vulnerabilities in gem dependencies used by Capistrano, reducing the risk of exploitation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `bundle audit` is run manually by developers before major releases, as documented in the release process in `docs/release_process.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated and regular gem auditing is missing. Integrating `bundle audit` into the CI/CD pipeline to run on every commit or daily builds would provide continuous vulnerability scanning for Capistrano's gem dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Access Control for Capistrano Deployments](./mitigation_strategies/implement_access_control_for_capistrano_deployments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Deployment Access:** Limit who can initiate Capistrano deployments. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize deployment actions.
