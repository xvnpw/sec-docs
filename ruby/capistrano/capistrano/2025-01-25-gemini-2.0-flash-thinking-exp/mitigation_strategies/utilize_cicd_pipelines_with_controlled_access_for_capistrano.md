#### 4.2. Threat Mitigation Analysis

*   **Uncontrolled Deployment Process (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High.** Integrating Capistrano into a CI/CD pipeline directly addresses this threat by establishing a controlled, standardized, and auditable deployment process. Automation and defined workflows eliminate ad-hoc deployments and enforce a consistent approach.
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Medium to High.** The impact reduction is significant as it moves from a potentially chaotic and unmanaged deployment process to a structured and governed one.

*   **Circumvention of Security Controls (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium to High.** By centralizing deployments within the CI/CD pipeline and implementing access control, this strategy significantly reduces the opportunity for developers to bypass security checks or best practices during deployments. Security gates and automated checks can be integrated into the pipeline to enforce security controls.
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Medium to High.** The impact reduction is substantial as it makes it significantly harder to circumvent security controls compared to manual deployments where developers might have more freedom to deviate from established procedures.

#### 4.3. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:** "Implemented. Capistrano deployments are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline."
    *   This indicates a good foundational step has been taken. The core of the mitigation strategy is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** "Further hardening of the CI/CD pipeline itself, specifically around access control and auditing for Capistrano deployment stages, could be improved. Regular security reviews of the CI/CD pipeline configuration are needed to ensure ongoing security."
    *   This highlights crucial areas for improvement. While Capistrano is in CI/CD, the pipeline itself needs further security attention. This is a critical point as the security of the entire deployment process hinges on the security of the CI/CD pipeline.
