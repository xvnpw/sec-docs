* **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the URL parameter used in a `Typhoeus::Request` to point to an internal server or an unintended external resource. This is done by injecting a malicious URL into the application's input that is then directly used as the `url` option for Typhoeus.
    * **Impact:** The attacker could gain unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing them to perform actions on internal systems. They could also use the application as a proxy to attack other external systems.
    * **Affected Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` object, specifically the `url` option.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data used to construct Typhoeus request URLs.
        * Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists for allowed destination hosts.
        * Avoid directly using user-supplied input to build URLs for Typhoeus requests.
        * Consider using URL parsing libraries to validate and reconstruct URLs safely before passing them to Typhoeus.

* **Threat:** Header Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers into a Typhoeus request by manipulating input that is used to construct the request `headers` option. This could involve adding new headers or modifying existing ones.
    * **Impact:** This could lead to various issues, including:
        * Bypassing security controls on the target server.
        * Cache poisoning.
        * Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected headers influence the response.
        * Session fixation or hijacking if session-related headers are manipulated.
    * **Affected Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` object, specifically the `headers` option.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate all input used to construct Typhoeus request headers.
        * Avoid directly using user-supplied input to set header values in Typhoeus requests.
        * Use predefined header names and values where possible.
        * Be cautious when allowing dynamic header construction based on user input for Typhoeus.

* **Threat:** Body Tampering
    * **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the request body of a Typhoeus request if the application dynamically constructs the `body` option based on user input without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** This could lead to:
        * Data corruption on the target server.
        * Execution of unintended actions on the target server.
        * Injection of malicious payloads.
    * **Affected Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` object, specifically the `body` option.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate all input used to construct the Typhoeus request body.
        * Use parameterized requests or safe serialization methods (e.g., JSON encoding with proper escaping) when setting the `body` option.
        * Avoid directly embedding user-supplied input into the Typhoeus request body without validation.

* **Threat:** Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    * **Description:** The application might be configured to use insecure TLS/SSL settings when making requests with Typhoeus, such as disabling certificate verification or allowing weak ciphers through the `ssl_options`.
    * **Impact:** This could expose the communication to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or modify the data being transmitted.
    * **Affected Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` object, specifically the `ssl_options` (e.g., `verify_peer`, `sslversion`, `ciphers`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure TLS certificate verification is enabled (`verify_peer: true`) in Typhoeus `ssl_options`.
        * Enforce the use of strong TLS versions (e.g., TLSv1.2 or higher) in Typhoeus `ssl_options`.
        * Configure secure cipher suites in Typhoeus `ssl_options`.
        * Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections via Typhoeus's `pin_certs` or `pin_public_keys` options.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Typhoeus Dependencies (libcurl)
    * **Description:** Typhoeus relies on the libcurl library, which may have its own security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not patched, they could be exploited through the application's use of Typhoeus.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in libcurl, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Typhoeus Component:** Underlying libcurl library used by Typhoeus.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the libcurl vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Typhoeus to the latest stable version, which typically includes updated libcurl bindings.
        * Monitor security advisories for libcurl and update the library independently if necessary, ensuring the updated version is compatible with the Typhoeus version being used.
