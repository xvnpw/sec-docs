### Key Attack Surface List: Typhoeus HTTP Client (High & Critical, Directly Involving Typhoeus)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Typhoeus and are classified as High or Critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unsanitized URL Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL used in a Typhoeus request to make the application send requests to unintended locations.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus is the mechanism through which the application makes the HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        user_provided_url = params[:target_url] # Attacker controls this
        Typhoeus.get(user_provided_url)
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, reading sensitive data, performing actions on internal services, port scanning, denial of service against internal or external targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data used to construct URLs for Typhoeus requests.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed hosts or URL patterns.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input in the URL.
        *   If possible, use a dedicated service or function to handle external requests with strict controls.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.

*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Header Injection via Unsanitized Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a Typhoeus request by manipulating input used to construct header values.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus allows setting custom headers, making it vulnerable if the header values are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        user_provided_header = params[:custom_header] # Attacker controls this
        Typhoeus.get("https://example.com", headers: { "Custom-Header" => user_provided_header })
        ```
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (leading to cross-site scripting or cache poisoning), session fixation, information disclosure through custom headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all input used to construct HTTP header values.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input for header values if possible.
        *   Use parameterized requests or dedicated functions for setting specific headers.
        *   Implement proper output encoding on the receiving end to mitigate the impact of response splitting.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    *   **Description:**  Typhoeus offers options to configure TLS/SSL verification. Disabling or improperly configuring these options can make the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus provides the configuration options that, if misused, weaken the security of the connection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        Typhoeus.get("https://vulnerable.example.com", ssl_verifyhost: 0, ssl_verifypeer: false) # Disabling verification
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Interception of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, modification of data in transit, impersonation of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always enable and properly configure TLS/SSL verification (`ssl_verifyhost: 2`, `ssl_verifypeer: true`).**
        *   Ensure the system has up-to-date Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
        *   Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections.
        *   Avoid disabling SSL verification unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks.
