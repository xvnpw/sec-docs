# Threat Model Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is used to construct the target URL for a Typhoeus request. The attacker crafts a malicious URL, potentially pointing to an attacker-controlled server or an internal resource the application shouldn't access.

**Impact:** The application makes requests to unintended destinations, potentially leading to data exfiltration, execution of arbitrary code on internal systems (SSRF), or triggering actions on behalf of the application.

**Affected Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` (specifically the `url` option).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs.
*   Use parameterized queries or URL encoding to prevent injection.
*   Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns.

## Threat: [Body Manipulation](./threats/body_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the request body when sending data using methods like POST or PUT. This is achieved by manipulating user-controlled input that forms part of the request body.

**Impact:** Depending on how the receiving server processes the body, this could lead to SQL injection, command injection, or data corruption on the remote system.

**Affected Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` (specifically the `body` option).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate all user-provided data before including it in request bodies.
*   Use appropriate encoding (e.g., JSON, XML) and ensure the receiving server expects that format.
*   Implement proper input validation on the receiving server as well.

## Threat: [Insecure Redirect Handling leading to SSRF/Data Exfiltration](./threats/insecure_redirect_handling_leading_to_ssrfdata_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** Typhoeus follows redirects by default. An attacker could manipulate the initial request or the redirect chain to force the application to make requests to internal resources or attacker-controlled servers.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), allowing access to internal services or data. Data exfiltration by redirecting to an attacker's server. Credential theft if redirected to a fake login page.

**Affected Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` (specifically the redirect handling mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate the need to follow redirects.
*   Implement checks on the redirect target URL to ensure it's within an expected domain or range (URL whitelisting).
*   Consider disabling redirects entirely if not required using the `followlocation: false` option.
*   Limit the number of redirects allowed using the `maxredirs` option.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_due_to_insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Description:** If SSL verification is disabled or improperly configured in Typhoeus, an attacker can intercept communication between the application and the remote server.

**Impact:**  Interception and potential modification of sensitive data transmitted between the application and the external service.

**Affected Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` (specifically the SSL/TLS related options like `ssl_verifyhost`, `ssl_verifypeer`, `sslcert`, `sslkey`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always enable SSL verification:** Set `ssl_verifyhost: 2` and `ssl_verifypeer: true`.
*   Ensure the system has up-to-date CA certificates.
*   Use client-side certificates (`sslcert`, `sslkey`) when required by the remote service.
*   Never disable SSL verification in production environments.

## Threat: [Routing Requests Through a Malicious Proxy](./threats/routing_requests_through_a_malicious_proxy.md)

**Description:** If proxy settings are directly configured within Typhoeus based on untrusted sources or user input without validation, an attacker can force the application to route requests through a proxy they control.

**Impact:** The attacker can intercept, monitor, and potentially modify requests and responses, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` (specifically the `proxy` option).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid relying on untrusted sources for direct proxy configuration within Typhoeus calls.
*   If proxy usage is necessary, configure it securely and validate any external sources of proxy information before passing it to Typhoeus.
*   Consider using environment variables or configuration files managed by the application administrator for proxy settings instead of directly in code.
