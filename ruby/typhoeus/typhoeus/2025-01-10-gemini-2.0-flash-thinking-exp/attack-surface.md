# Attack Surface Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/url_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL used in a Typhoeus request, causing the application to make requests to unintended destinations.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus directly executes the HTTP request based on the URL provided to it. If this URL is constructed using unsanitized user input, Typhoeus facilitates the malicious request.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a website URL from a user and uses Typhoeus to fetch its content. An attacker provides `http://evil.com?param=<script>malicious code</script>`, causing Typhoeus to make a request to the attacker's controlled server.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), information disclosure, access to internal resources, potential for further exploitation on the target system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used to construct URLs before passing them to Typhoeus.
        *   **URL Encoding:** Properly encode the URL components to prevent interpretation of special characters by Typhoeus.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic URL Construction:** If possible, avoid constructing URLs dynamically based on user input for Typhoeus requests.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a Typhoeus request.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus allows setting custom headers. If header values are built using unsanitized user input, Typhoeus will include these malicious headers in the outgoing request.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom `User-Agent` header. An attacker injects `User-Agent: MyAgent\r\nEvil-Header: malicious_value`. Typhoeus sends this header, potentially leading to unexpected behavior on the receiving server.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the injected header is reflected, cache poisoning, session fixation, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used for header values before setting them in Typhoeus.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Header Construction:** Prefer predefined, safe header values when configuring Typhoeus requests.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/request_body_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the content of the HTTP request body sent by Typhoeus.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus transmits the request body provided to it. If this body is constructed using unsanitized user input, Typhoeus will send the manipulated content to the target server.
    *   **Example:** An application sends JSON data in the request body using Typhoeus. An attacker manipulates the input to inject extra fields or modify existing ones, and Typhoeus sends this altered body.
    *   **Impact:** Data injection, command injection (if the backend processes the body as commands), business logic bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used to construct the request body before passing it to Typhoeus.
        *   **Use Parameterized Requests:** If possible, construct request bodies in a way that prevents direct injection, rather than string concatenation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Typhoeus is configured to use insecure SSL/TLS settings, making the connection vulnerable to attacks.
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus provides options to configure SSL/TLS settings, such as disabling certificate verification or using weak ciphers. Incorrectly configuring these options within Typhoeus directly weakens the security of the connection.
    *   **Example:** An application disables SSL certificate verification in Typhoeus using `ssl_verifypeer: false`. Typhoeus will then connect to any server, regardless of the validity of its certificate, making it susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, eavesdropping, data interception, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Certificate Verification:** Always enable SSL certificate verification (`ssl_verifypeer: true`) when configuring Typhoeus.
        *   **Use Strong Ciphers:** Configure Typhoeus to use strong and up-to-date cipher suites. Avoid using weak or outdated ciphers.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in Typhoeus's dependencies (e.g., `libcurl`).
    *   **How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus relies on underlying libraries for its functionality. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, Typhoeus, by using them, becomes a conduit for exploiting those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of `libcurl` that Typhoeus depends on. An attacker can potentially trigger this vulnerability through actions performed by Typhoeus.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Typhoeus and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Typhoeus's dependencies.
