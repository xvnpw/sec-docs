## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Compromise Application via Typhoeus](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_typhoeus.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Typhoeus library.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Manipulate Requests Sent by Typhoeus](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__manipulate_requests_sent_by_typhoeus.md)

Attackers aim to control or influence the HTTP requests made by the application using Typhoeus. This can be achieved by injecting malicious data into various parts of the request.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exploit Unvalidated Input in URL Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_unvalidated_input_in_url_parameters.md)

Attackers target applications that incorporate user-provided data directly into the URL parameters of Typhoeus requests without proper validation or sanitization.
*   This allows them to inject malicious code or control characters into the URL.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Leverage Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__leverage_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

By manipulating the URL, attackers can force the application to make requests to unintended locations, including internal services or external systems.
*   This can bypass network firewalls and access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exfiltrate Internal Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exfiltrate_internal_data.md)

Through SSRF, attackers can make requests to internal services that expose sensitive data, causing the application to inadvertently exfiltrate this data to the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Access Internal Services](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__access_internal_services.md)

SSRF allows attackers to interact with internal services that are not directly accessible from the external network, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exploit Unvalidated Input in POST/PUT Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_unvalidated_input_in_postput_data.md)

Attackers target applications that include user-provided data in the body of POST or PUT requests made by Typhoeus without proper validation.
*   This allows them to inject malicious payloads targeting the APIs or services the application is communicating with.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Inject Malicious Payloads for Downstream APIs](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_payloads_for_downstream_apis.md)

By injecting malicious data into the request body, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the downstream APIs, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or even code execution on those systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Exploit Typhoeus's Handling of Responses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_typhoeus's_handling_of_responses.md)

Attackers aim to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes the responses received from external services via Typhoeus.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exploit Insecure Deserialization of Response Body](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_insecure_deserialization_of_response_body.md)

If the application uses Typhoeus to fetch data (e.g., JSON, YAML) and then deserializes it without proper security measures, attackers can inject malicious payloads into the response that execute code on the application server during deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Execute Arbitrary Code on Application Server](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__execute_arbitrary_code_on_application_server.md)

Successful exploitation of insecure deserialization can grant the attacker complete control over the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exploit Lack of Response Validation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_lack_of_response_validation.md)

Attackers target applications that trust the responses received from external services via Typhoeus without proper verification of their integrity or content.
*   This allows them to introduce malicious or incorrect data into the application's workflow by compromising the external service or intercepting the response.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Introduce Malicious Data into Application Workflow](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__introduce_malicious_data_into_application_workflow.md)

By injecting malicious data, attackers can cause the application to perform unintended actions, corrupt data, or expose vulnerabilities in its business logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities within Typhoeus Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_within_typhoeus_library_itself.md)

Attackers target known or unknown vulnerabilities present within the Typhoeus library's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Typhoeus Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_typhoeus_code.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of Typhoeus to compromise applications using those vulnerable versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL_NODE] Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__trigger_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

Some vulnerabilities in Typhoeus might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application server by crafting specific requests or exploiting flaws in the library's processing logic.
