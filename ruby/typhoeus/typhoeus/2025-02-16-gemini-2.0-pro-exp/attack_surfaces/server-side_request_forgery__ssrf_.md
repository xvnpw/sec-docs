Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack surface related to Typhoeus, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Typhoeus

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within the context of applications using the Typhoeus library.  We aim to:

*   Understand how Typhoeus's functionality can be exploited for SSRF.
*   Identify specific code patterns and configurations that increase SSRF risk.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.
*   Consider edge cases and potential bypasses of common mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on SSRF vulnerabilities arising from the use of the Typhoeus library in Ruby applications.  It covers:

*   **Direct SSRF:**  Where attacker-controlled input directly influences the URL used in a Typhoeus request.
*   **Indirect SSRF:**  Where attacker-controlled input might influence other parameters (e.g., headers) that could indirectly lead to SSRF.  (While less direct, these are still important to consider).
*   **DNS Rebinding Attacks:** A specific type of SSRF that leverages DNS resolution timing.
*   **Typhoeus-specific features:**  Options and configurations within Typhoeus that can impact SSRF vulnerability.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   SSRF vulnerabilities unrelated to Typhoeus (e.g., vulnerabilities in other libraries or application logic).
*   General web application security best practices (beyond those directly relevant to SSRF).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining example code snippets (both vulnerable and mitigated) to illustrate attack vectors and defenses.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Identifying potential attack scenarios and the impact of successful exploitation.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing the Typhoeus documentation for relevant features and security considerations.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Leveraging established security best practices for SSRF prevention.
*   **Testing (Conceptual):**  Describing how testing strategies can be used to identify and validate SSRF vulnerabilities.  (This analysis won't involve actual execution of exploits).

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Core Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input

The fundamental vulnerability lies in allowing user-supplied input to directly control the target URL of a Typhoeus request.  This is the classic SSRF scenario:

```ruby
# VULNERABLE CODE
url = params[:url]  # User-controlled input
response = Typhoeus.get(url)
```

An attacker can provide a malicious URL, such as:

*   `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata service)
*   `file:///etc/passwd` (Local file access)
*   `http://localhost:6379` (Internal Redis instance)
*   `http://internal-service.example.com` (Internal service not exposed to the internet)

### 2.2 Typhoeus-Specific Considerations

While Typhoeus itself doesn't *introduce* SSRF, its features and default behavior are relevant:

*   **Follows Redirects (by default):**  Typhoeus follows HTTP redirects by default (`followlocation: true`).  This can be abused in SSRF attacks.  An attacker might provide a URL that redirects to an internal resource.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully consider whether redirects are necessary.  If not, disable them: `Typhoeus.get(url, followlocation: false)`. If redirects are needed, validate the *redirected* URL against the whitelist *before* following it.
*   **Connection Reuse (by default):** Typhoeus reuses connections for performance.  This is a key component of DNS rebinding attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Disable connection reuse: `Typhoeus.get(url, forbid_reuse: true)`.  This has a performance cost, but it's crucial for preventing DNS rebinding.
*   **No Default Protocol Restriction:** Typhoeus doesn't restrict the URL scheme (protocol) by default.  This allows attackers to use schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, etc.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Explicitly validate the URL scheme and only allow `http://` and `https://`.
* **Custom Headers:** While less direct, if user input controls request headers, an attacker *might* be able to influence the request in a way that leads to SSRF.  This is less common but should be considered.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid allowing user input to control request headers. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize header values.

### 2.3 DNS Rebinding Attacks

DNS rebinding is a sophisticated SSRF technique that exploits the time difference between DNS resolution and connection establishment.

1.  **Attacker's Setup:** The attacker controls a domain (e.g., `attacker.com`) and configures its DNS server to respond with two different IP addresses:
    *   **First Response:** A public, benign IP address (e.g., the attacker's web server).
    *   **Second Response:** A private, internal IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or an internal service).  The DNS server has a very short Time-To-Live (TTL) for the record.

2.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker provides the URL `http://attacker.com` to the vulnerable application.
    *   The application (using Typhoeus) resolves `attacker.com` to the benign IP address and passes the initial whitelist check (if any).
    *   Typhoeus establishes a connection to the benign IP.
    *   The attacker's server responds, potentially with a redirect or other content.
    *   Due to connection reuse, Typhoeus *reuses* the existing connection for subsequent requests.
    *   The DNS record expires (short TTL).
    *   The application (or Typhoeus) re-resolves `attacker.com`, now getting the internal IP address.
    *   Because the connection is reused, Typhoeus sends the request to the *internal* IP address, bypassing the initial whitelist check.

**Typhoeus's `forbid_reuse: true` option is *essential* to prevent this attack.**

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

#### 2.4.1 Strict URL Whitelisting (Best Practice)

This is the most robust defense.  Maintain a list of *explicitly allowed* URLs or URL patterns.  Reject *any* request that doesn't match the whitelist.

```ruby
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'api.example.com'].freeze

def safe_request(user_url)
  uri = URI.parse(user_url)
  return unless ALLOWED_HOSTS.include?(uri.host)
  return unless ['http', 'https'].include?(uri.scheme)

  Typhoeus.get(user_url, forbid_reuse: true) # Prevent DNS rebinding
end
```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Granularity:**  Be as specific as possible with the whitelist.  Avoid overly broad patterns.
*   **Regular Expressions (Carefully):**  If using regular expressions, ensure they are tightly constrained and thoroughly tested to prevent bypasses.  Consider using a dedicated URL parsing library instead.
*   **Dynamic Whitelists:**  If the whitelist needs to be dynamic, ensure the mechanism for updating it is secure and cannot be manipulated by attackers.

#### 2.4.2 Input Validation and Sanitization (If Whitelisting is Impossible)

If a whitelist is not feasible (rare), rigorous input validation is *essential*.  This is *much* harder to get right and is more prone to bypasses.

```ruby
def validate_url(user_url)
  begin
    uri = URI.parse(user_url)

    # Check scheme
    return false unless ['http', 'https'].include?(uri.scheme)

    # Check host (example: prevent IP addresses, localhost, etc.)
    return false if uri.host.match?(/\A(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\z/) # Basic IP check
    return false if uri.host == 'localhost'
    return false if uri.host.end_with?('.internal') # Example internal domain

    # Check port (if applicable)
    return false if uri.port && !([80, 443].include?(uri.port))

    # Check path (if applicable - be very careful with path validation)
    # ...

    return true
  rescue URI::InvalidURIError
    return false
  end
end

def safe_request(user_url)
  return unless validate_url(user_url)
  Typhoeus.get(user_url, forbid_reuse: true)
end
```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Use a URL Parsing Library:**  Use a robust URL parsing library (like Ruby's `URI` module) to decompose the URL into its components.  Don't rely on manual string manipulation or regular expressions alone.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Combine multiple validation checks (scheme, host, port, path, query parameters).
*   **Blacklisting vs. Whitelisting:**  Even within input validation, prefer whitelisting (allowing only known-good patterns) over blacklisting (blocking known-bad patterns).  Blacklisting is almost always incomplete.
*   **Normalization:**  Be aware of URL normalization issues.  Attackers might use different encodings or representations of the same URL to bypass validation.  The URL parsing library should handle normalization, but be aware of potential edge cases.

#### 2.4.3 Network Segmentation

Even with application-level defenses, network segmentation is a crucial layer of defense.  Configure your network to:

*   **Limit Outbound Connections:**  Restrict the application server's ability to initiate connections to internal networks or sensitive services.  Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs).
*   **Isolate Sensitive Services:**  Place sensitive internal services on separate networks with strict access controls.

#### 2.4.4 Disable Connection Reuse (`forbid_reuse: true`)

As discussed, this is essential for preventing DNS rebinding attacks.  Always use `forbid_reuse: true` when making requests based on user-supplied URLs.

#### 2.4.5 Limit Allowed Protocols

Explicitly check the URL scheme and only allow `http` and `https`. This prevents attackers from using other protocols like `file://`, `gopher://`, or `ftp://` to access local files or internal services.

### 2.5 Testing for SSRF

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in your code. Look for instances where user input is used directly in Typhoeus requests without proper validation.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use a web application security scanner to test for SSRF vulnerabilities. These tools can automatically send malicious requests to your application and identify potential issues.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:** Engage a security expert to perform manual penetration testing. This is the most effective way to identify complex SSRF vulnerabilities, including DNS rebinding attacks.
*   **Fuzzing:** Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of variations of URLs, including those with special characters, different protocols, and encoded values. This can help uncover unexpected vulnerabilities.
* **Specific Test Cases:**
    *   **Localhost Access:** Try accessing `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, and other loopback addresses.
    *   **Internal IP Addresses:** Try accessing private IP address ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`).
    *   **Cloud Metadata Services:** Try accessing cloud metadata services (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` on AWS).
    *   **File Access:** Try accessing local files using `file:///`.
    *   **Other Protocols:** Try using other protocols like `gopher://`, `ftp://`, etc.
    *   **DNS Rebinding:** Test for DNS rebinding vulnerabilities using a tool like `singularity` or by manually configuring a DNS server with a short TTL.
    * **Encoded Payloads:** Try different URL encodings to bypass filters.

## 3. Conclusion

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences.  When using Typhoeus, the primary risk comes from allowing unvalidated user input to control the target URL of HTTP requests.  The most effective mitigation is strict URL whitelisting, combined with disabling connection reuse (`forbid_reuse: true`) to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.  If whitelisting is not possible, rigorous input validation and sanitization are essential, but this approach is more error-prone.  Network segmentation provides an additional layer of defense.  Thorough testing, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, manual penetration testing, and fuzzing, is crucial for identifying and mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities. Remember to always validate the URL scheme and restrict it to `http` and `https`.
