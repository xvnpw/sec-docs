Okay, let's create a detailed design document for the Typhoeus project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Typhoeus appears to be a project focused on providing a user-friendly interface and tooling for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, specifically targeting cost optimization and resource management.  It seems to be in a relatively early stage of development.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a simplified, user-friendly way to manage Kubernetes resources.
*   Enable users to visualize and understand their Kubernetes cluster costs.
*   Offer tools to optimize Kubernetes resource utilization and reduce costs.
*   Potentially attract a user base and build a community around the project.
*   Establish a foundation for future expansion and feature additions.

Business Goals:

*   Increase user adoption of the tool.
*   Reduce the complexity of Kubernetes management for users.
*   Demonstrably help users save money on their Kubernetes deployments.
*   Gather user feedback to guide future development.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to user's Kubernetes clusters.
*   Incorrect cost calculations or optimization recommendations leading to financial losses for users.
*   Lack of adoption due to usability issues or insufficient features.
*   Competition from existing Kubernetes management and cost optimization tools.
*   Vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by attackers.
*   Inability to scale the application to handle a large number of users or clusters.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project utilizes Go, which offers some memory safety features compared to languages like C/C++. (Implicit in the choice of language).
*   security control: Relies on Kubernetes' existing RBAC system for authorization within the target cluster. (Implicit in the interaction with Kubernetes).
*   security control: Uses standard Kubernetes API client libraries. (Implicit in the code).
*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community scrutiny and contributions to security. (Project nature).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project is in early development, and comprehensive security audits may not have been performed.
*   accepted risk: Relies on the user's existing Kubernetes cluster security configuration.  Typhoeus itself doesn't manage cluster security.
*   accepted risk: The project may have unknown vulnerabilities due to its early stage.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust authentication mechanism for users accessing the Typhoeus UI, potentially leveraging existing identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0/OIDC).
*   Introduce input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, especially when interacting with the Kubernetes API.
*   Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Establish a clear security vulnerability disclosure and response process.
*   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools into the build pipeline.
*   Consider implementing dynamic application security testing (DAST) to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   Provide documentation and guidance on securely deploying and configuring Typhoeus.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users must be authenticated before accessing the Typhoeus UI and interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered.
    *   Authentication tokens should be securely stored and managed.
*   Authorization:
    *   Typhoeus should leverage Kubernetes RBAC to enforce authorization within the target cluster.
    *   Access to Typhoeus features and data should be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-provided input must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, XSS).
    *   Data received from the Kubernetes API should also be treated with caution and validated.
*   Cryptography:
    *   All sensitive data, including API tokens and credentials, should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Proper key management practices must be followed.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Manual Deployment to a Kubernetes Cluster:**  Users could manually build the Docker image and deploy it to their Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`.
2.  **Helm Chart:** A Helm chart could be provided to simplify deployment and configuration.
3.  **Kubernetes Operator:** A Kubernetes Operator could be developed to manage the lifecycle of Typhoeus instances within a cluster.
4.  **SaaS Offering:**  Typhoeus could be offered as a hosted service (SaaS), abstracting away the deployment details from the user.

Chosen Solution (for detailed description): **Helm Chart**

This is a good balance between ease of deployment and user control.

    Developer["Developer"] --> GitHub["GitHub (Source Code)"]
    GitHub --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- "go build" --> BuildArtifact["Build Artifact (Binary)"]
    GitHubActions -- "docker build" --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  A developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers a CI workflow.
3.  The workflow performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Runs a linter (e.g., `golangci-lint`) to check for code style and potential issues.
    *   Runs a SAST tool (e.g., `gosec`) to scan for security vulnerabilities in the Go code.
    *   Runs an SCA tool (e.g., `Trivy`) to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Builds the Go binary using `go build`.
    *   Builds a Docker image using `docker build`.
    *   Pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Linting (using `golangci-lint`).
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using a tool like `gosec`.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) using a tool like `Trivy`.
*   security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing accurate Kubernetes cost information.
*   Offering effective resource optimization recommendations.
*   Maintaining the availability and responsiveness of the Typhoeus application.
*   Protecting user data and credentials.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Kubernetes API credentials/tokens: Highly sensitive.  Unauthorized access could allow complete control of the user's cluster.
*   Cloud provider credentials/tokens: Highly sensitive.  Unauthorized access could allow access to the user's cloud resources.
*   Kubernetes cluster resource usage data: Moderately sensitive.  Could reveal information about the user's applications and infrastructure.
*   Cost data: Moderately sensitive.  Could reveal information about the user's spending.
*   User authentication information (if implemented): Highly sensitive.  Must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to Typhoeus.
