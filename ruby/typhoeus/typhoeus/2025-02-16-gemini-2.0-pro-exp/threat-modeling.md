# Threat Model Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Threat: [Unvalidated SSL/TLS Certificates (MITM)](./threats/unvalidated_ssltls_certificates__mitm_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unvalidated SSL/TLS Certificates (MITM)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network connection between the application using Typhoeus and the target server.  The attacker presents a forged SSL/TLS certificate, which Typhoeus accepts because certificate validation is disabled or improperly configured. The attacker can then decrypt, view, and potentially modify the traffic.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of confidentiality (data leakage), integrity (data modification), and potentially authentication (if credentials are transmitted).  The attacker can steal sensitive data, inject malicious content, or impersonate the server.
    *   **Typhoeus Component Affected:**  `Typhoeus::Request` options related to SSL/TLS: `:ssl_verifypeer`, `:ssl_verifyhost`, `:cainfo`, `:capath`, `:sslcert`, `:sslkey`.  The underlying libcurl library is also involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `:ssl_verifypeer` is set to `true` (this is the default).
        *   Ensure `:ssl_verifyhost` is set to `2` (this is the default).
        *   Do *not* disable certificate verification unless absolutely necessary (and only in controlled testing environments).
        *   Keep the system's CA certificate store up-to-date.
        *   For high-security scenarios, consider certificate pinning using `:cainfo`, `:capath`, and `:sslcert` to specify the exact expected certificate or public key.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling (via Header Manipulation)](./threats/http_request_smuggling__via_header_manipulation_.md)

*   **Threat:**  HTTP Request Smuggling (via Header Manipulation)

    *   **Description:** Although less common with modern servers and libcurl, an attacker could craft malicious headers that exploit vulnerabilities in how the target server or an intermediary proxy parses HTTP requests. This could lead to request smuggling, where the attacker's request is interpreted as multiple requests, potentially bypassing security controls. Typhoeus itself doesn't *create* this vulnerability, but it's the mechanism by which the malicious headers are sent.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access to resources, potential for server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Typhoeus Component Affected:**  `Typhoeus::Request`'s `headers` option. The underlying libcurl library's handling of headers is also relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the target server's vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid passing user-supplied data directly into request headers without thorough validation and sanitization.
        *   Be aware of the potential for header injection vulnerabilities and follow secure coding practices for handling user input.
        *   Keep libcurl and the target server software up-to-date to patch any known request smuggling vulnerabilities.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can detect and block request smuggling attempts.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:**  Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs

    *   **Description:**  The application logs Typhoeus requests and/or responses, inadvertently including sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or personally identifiable information (PII) in the logs.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, leading to potential account compromise, identity theft, or privacy violations.
    *   **Typhoeus Component Affected:**  `Typhoeus::Request` (all options, especially URL, headers, and body), `Typhoeus::Response` (headers and body).  The application's logging mechanism is also a key factor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement careful log sanitization.  Redact or remove sensitive information from logs *before* they are written.
        *   Use a logging library that supports redaction patterns or filtering.
        *   Avoid logging entire request bodies or headers unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Regularly review and audit logging configurations.
        *   Store logs securely and restrict access to authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Using deprecated or vulnerable TLS versions](./threats/using_deprecated_or_vulnerable_tls_versions.md)

* **Threat:** Using deprecated or vulnerable TLS versions.

    *   **Description:** Typhoeus is configured to use an outdated or vulnerable TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, or even SSLv3), making the connection susceptible to known cryptographic attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of confidentiality and integrity of the communication. Attackers can potentially decrypt the traffic and modify it.
    *   **Typhoeus Component Affected:** `Typhoeus::Request`, specifically the `:ssl_version` option.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Do *not* explicitly set `:ssl_version` unless absolutely necessary. Allow Typhoeus and libcurl to negotiate the best available TLS version.
        *   If you *must* set `:ssl_version`, ensure it's set to a secure version (TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3).
        *   Keep your system's OpenSSL (or equivalent) library up-to-date.
