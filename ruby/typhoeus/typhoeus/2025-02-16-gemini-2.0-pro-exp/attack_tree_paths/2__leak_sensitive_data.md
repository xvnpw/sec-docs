## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.1.4

**4.1. Vulnerability Description (Recap)**

An attacker exploits the `followlocation` feature of Typhoeus to perform an SSRF attack.  The attacker crafts a malicious request to the application that uses Typhoeus.  This request includes a URL that, when processed by Typhoeus, will redirect (via a 3xx HTTP status code) to an internal service or resource.  Because `followlocation` is enabled (and not properly restricted), Typhoeus automatically follows the redirect, making a request to the internal service on behalf of the attacker.  This bypasses network-level protections that would normally prevent direct external access to the internal service.

**4.2. Technical Details**

*   **`followlocation`:** This option, when set to `true` (or a positive integer representing the maximum number of redirects to follow), instructs Typhoeus to automatically follow HTTP redirects (301, 302, 303, 307, 308 status codes).
*   **Redirect Mechanism:**  The attacker controls the initial URL provided to the application.  This URL points to a server controlled by the attacker.  When Typhoeus makes a request to this attacker-controlled server, the server responds with a 3xx redirect, pointing to an internal IP address or hostname (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, `http://internal-service.local`, `http://192.168.1.100`).
*   **Internal Service Access:**  Typhoeus, running within the application's server environment, *can* typically access internal services that are not exposed to the public internet.  This is because the request originates from within the trusted network.
*   **Bypass of Network Security:**  Traditional firewalls and network segmentation are designed to prevent *external* access to internal services.  SSRF bypasses this by using the application server itself as a proxy to access the internal resources.

**4.3. Attack Scenario Example**

1.  **Application Setup:** An application uses Typhoeus to fetch content from external URLs provided by users (e.g., a URL preview service, a proxy, or an image fetcher).  `followlocation` is enabled by default or set to a high value.
2.  **Attacker's Server:** The attacker sets up a web server at `http://attacker.com/evil`.
3.  **Malicious Request:** The attacker sends a request to the application, providing the URL `http://attacker.com/evil`.
4.  **Typhoeus Request:** The application uses Typhoeus to fetch the content from `http://attacker.com/evil`.
5.  **Redirect Response:** The attacker's server responds with a 302 redirect to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin` (an internal admin panel).
6.  **Typhoeus Follows Redirect:**  Because `followlocation` is enabled, Typhoeus automatically follows the redirect and makes a request to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`.
7.  **Internal Service Access:** The internal admin panel responds to the request, potentially leaking sensitive information or allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions.
8.  **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker's server might log the request made by the application, or the internal service's response might be relayed back to the attacker through the application (depending on how the application handles the response).

**4.4. Risk Assessment**

*   **Likelihood: High.**  If `followlocation` is enabled without proper validation of redirect targets, the likelihood of exploitation is high.  Attackers can easily craft redirects.
*   **Impact: High to Critical.**  The impact depends on the nature of the internal service being accessed.  It could range from leaking sensitive data (database credentials, API keys, internal documentation) to gaining full control of internal systems.
*   **Effort: Very Low.**  The attacker only needs to set up a simple redirect server.  No complex exploit code is required.
*   **Skill Level: Very Low.**  Basic understanding of HTTP redirects is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty: High.**  Without specific monitoring and logging of redirect targets, it can be difficult to distinguish legitimate redirects from malicious ones.  The requests appear to originate from the application server itself.

**4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

Here's a breakdown of the mitigation strategies, with a focus on practical implementation:

1.  **Disable `followlocation` (If Possible):**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is the most secure option if the application's functionality does not *require* following redirects.
    *   **Implementation:**  Simply omit the `followlocation` option or set it to `false` when configuring Typhoeus requests.
        ```ruby
        Typhoeus.get("http://example.com", followlocation: false)
        ```
    *   **Pros:** Eliminates the vulnerability entirely.
    *   **Cons:** May break functionality that relies on redirects.

2.  **Limit `followlocation` and Validate Redirect Targets (Whitelist):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  If redirects are necessary, strictly limit the number of allowed redirects and implement a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Set `followlocation` to a low, reasonable number (e.g., 1 or 2).
        *   Use a callback (e.g., `on_complete`) to inspect the final URL after all redirects have been followed.  Compare this URL against a predefined whitelist.  If the URL is not on the whitelist, abort the request and log the event.
        ```ruby
        allowed_domains = ["example.com", "another-safe-domain.com"]

        Typhoeus.get("http://example.com", followlocation: 2, on_complete: lambda do |response|
          if response.success?
            final_url = response.effective_url
            uri = URI.parse(final_url)
            if allowed_domains.include?(uri.host)
              # Process the response
              puts "Request successful and within allowed domains."
            else
              # Log the attempted SSRF and abort
              puts "SSRF attempt detected!  Final URL: #{final_url}"
              # Potentially raise an exception or take other action
            end
          else
            # Handle other errors
            puts "Request failed: #{response.code}"
          end
        end)
        ```
    *   **Pros:**  Allows legitimate redirects while preventing SSRF to arbitrary internal services.  Provides good balance between security and functionality.
    *   **Cons:** Requires careful maintenance of the whitelist.  Can be bypassed if the attacker finds a way to redirect to a whitelisted domain and then exploit a vulnerability on *that* domain to reach an internal service (a more complex attack).

3.  **Blacklist (Less Effective):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Maintain a blacklist of known internal IP addresses and hostnames (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `192.168.*.*`, `10.*.*.*`, `172.16.*.*` to `172.31.*.*`).  Check the redirect target against this blacklist.
    *   **Implementation:** Similar to the whitelist approach, but using a blacklist instead.
    *   **Pros:**  Simpler to implement initially than a whitelist.
    *   **Cons:**  Much less effective than a whitelist.  Attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists (e.g., using alternative IP representations, DNS rebinding, or exploiting open redirects on seemingly safe domains).  **Not recommended as the primary defense.**

4.  **Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement strong network segmentation to isolate internal services.  Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to internal resources, even from within the application server's network.
    *   **Implementation:**  This is a network-level defense, not specific to Typhoeus.  Configure firewalls to deny access to internal services from the application server's network segment, except for explicitly allowed connections.
    *   **Pros:**  Provides a strong defense-in-depth layer.  Even if the application-level controls are bypassed, the network-level restrictions should prevent access.
    *   **Cons:**  Requires careful network planning and configuration.  Can be complex to manage.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Use a WAF with SSRF detection and prevention capabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**  Configure the WAF to inspect outgoing requests and block those that match SSRF patterns (e.g., attempts to access internal IP addresses or hostnames).
    *   **Pros:**  Provides an additional layer of defense.  Can be easier to manage than complex application-level rules.
    *   **Cons:**  WAFs can be bypassed.  Requires careful configuration and tuning to avoid false positives.  May introduce performance overhead.

6.  **Request Inspection and Sanitization:**
    * **Recommendation:** If the application receives URLs from user input, thoroughly sanitize and validate these URLs *before* passing them to Typhoeus.
    * **Implementation:**
        *   Use a robust URL parsing library to decompose the URL into its components.
        *   Validate the scheme (e.g., only allow `http` and `https`).
        *   Validate the hostname against a whitelist or a strict set of rules.
        *   Reject any URLs that contain suspicious characters or patterns.
    * **Pros:** Prevents many SSRF attempts at the source.
    * **Cons:** Can be complex to implement correctly. Attackers may find ways to bypass input validation.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive logging of all Typhoeus requests, including the original URL, the redirect chain (if `followlocation` is enabled), and the final effective URL. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as requests to internal IP addresses or unexpected redirects.
    * **Implementation:** Use Typhoeus's `on_complete` callback to log relevant information. Integrate with a centralized logging and monitoring system.
    * **Pros:** Enables detection of SSRF attempts, even if they are not blocked. Provides valuable data for incident response.
    * **Cons:** Requires a robust logging and monitoring infrastructure.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The SSRF vulnerability related to `followlocation` in Typhoeus is a serious threat that can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services.  The most effective mitigation is to **disable `followlocation` if it is not strictly required**.  If redirects are necessary, a combination of **limiting `followlocation`, implementing a strict whitelist of allowed domains, and robust network segmentation** provides the best defense.  A WAF and comprehensive logging should be used as additional layers of defense.  The development team should prioritize implementing these mitigations to protect the application and its internal resources.  Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
