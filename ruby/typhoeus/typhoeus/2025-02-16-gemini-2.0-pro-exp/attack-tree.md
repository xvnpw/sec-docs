## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This attack exploits a vulnerability where the application (or a library it uses, potentially through Typhoeus's interaction) deserializes untrusted data without proper validation.  If an attacker can control the serialized data, they can craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **1.1.3 Typhoeus (or underlying libcurl) deserializes the payload, triggering RCE. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If vulnerable deserialization is present)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Passive, relies on existing vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to distinguish from legitimate deserialization)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data altogether.
            *   If deserialization is necessary, use a safe deserialization library that prevents code execution.
            *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes during deserialization.
            *   Use robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.

*   **1.4 Exploit unsafe usage of `followlocation` with untrusted redirects. [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This attack leverages Typhoeus's `followlocation` feature. If the application makes a request to a URL controlled by the attacker, and `followlocation` is enabled, the attacker can redirect Typhoeus to a malicious URL. This malicious URL could exploit other vulnerabilities (like the deserialization vulnerability above) or directly lead to information disclosure (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`).
    *   **1.4.4 Typhoeus follows the redirect, leading to RCE or information disclosure. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If redirect is not validated)
        *   **Impact:** High-Very High (Potential RCE or information disclosure)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Passive)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to distinguish from legitimate redirects if not monitored)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Validate all redirect URLs before following them.
            *   Implement a whitelist of allowed redirect domains.
            *   Disable `followlocation` if it's not strictly necessary.
            *   If `followlocation` is required, use a small `maxredirs` value to limit the number of redirects.
            *   Log all redirects and monitor for suspicious patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leak Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__leak_sensitive_data.md)

*   **2.1 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `followlocation` [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  Similar to 1.4, this attack uses `followlocation` to redirect Typhoeus.  However, instead of aiming for RCE, the attacker redirects to an *internal* service or resource that is not normally accessible from the outside.  This allows the attacker to bypass network restrictions and access sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **2.1.4 Typhoeus follows the redirect and accesses the internal service. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If redirect is not validated)
        *   **Impact:** High (Exposure of internal services)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Passive)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to distinguish from legitimate redirects if not monitored)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Same mitigations as 1.4.4 (validate redirects, whitelist, disable/limit `followlocation`).
            *   Implement strong network segmentation to isolate internal services.  Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to internal resources.
            *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block SSRF attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Cause Denial-of-Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__cause_denial-of-service__dos_.md)

*   **3.1 Resource Exhaustion via Many Concurrent Requests [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is a classic DoS attack. The attacker uses Typhoeus (potentially its Hydra feature for parallel requests) to flood the server with a large number of requests.  The goal is to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, file descriptors), making it unable to respond to legitimate requests.
    *   **3.1.2 The server runs out of resources (e.g., memory, file descriptors, CPU) to handle the requests. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Depends on server resources and configuration)
        *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Passive)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Server monitoring will detect resource exhaustion)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
            *   Use connection limits to prevent a single client from opening too many connections.
            *   Employ a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
            *   Configure web server timeouts appropriately.
            *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for high resource consumption.
            *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static content and reduce the load on the origin server.

*   **3.2 Slowloris Attack (If Typhoeus doesn't handle timeouts properly) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This attack exploits servers that don't handle slow connections properly.  The attacker establishes multiple connections but sends only partial HTTP requests, very slowly.  The server keeps these connections open, waiting for the complete request, eventually exhausting its connection pool and becoming unresponsive.
    *   **3.2.3 The server waits for the complete requests, consuming resources. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (If timeouts are not properly configured)
        *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Passive)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring connection states and resource usage)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Set appropriate timeouts for Typhoeus requests: both `connecttimeout` (time to establish a connection) and `timeout` (time to receive a response).
            *   Configure the web server to handle slow connections.  For example, in Apache, use the `reqtimeout` module.  Nginx has similar configurations.
            *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer that can detect and mitigate slowloris attacks.
