# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict URL Whitelisting and Validation (using Typhoeus `params`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_url_whitelisting_and_validation__using_typhoeus__params__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed URLs:**  (External to Typhoeus - configuration file or environment variables).
    2.  **URL Parsing:** (External to Typhoeus - use a URL parsing library).
    3.  **Whitelist Check:** (External to Typhoeus - compare parsed URL to whitelist).
    4.  **Parameterization:**  *Crucially*, if the URL contains dynamic parts (query parameters), *always* use Typhoeus's `params` option to pass them.  *Never* build the URL by string concatenation within the code that calls Typhoeus.  Typhoeus will handle the proper URL encoding.
    5.  **Example (Ruby):**
        ```ruby
        require 'typhoeus'

        # Assume ALLOWED_HOSTS and is_safe_url? are defined elsewhere

        def safe_request(base_url, params = {})
          raise "Disallowed URL" unless is_safe_url?(base_url)

          Typhoeus.get(base_url, params: params) # Use Typhoeus's params option
        end
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through whitelisting).
    *   **URL Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious characters into the URL via query parameters.
    *   **Open Redirect (Low Severity):** (Indirectly, through whitelisting and if redirects are handled).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (relies on external whitelist).
    *   **URL Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced for query parameters.
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk reduced (relies on external redirect handling).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Parameterization using Typhoeus's `params` option is not consistently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Parameterization is inconsistent. Some endpoints use string concatenation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Management (using Typhoeus options)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_management__using_typhoeus_options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Appropriate Timeouts:** (External to Typhoeus - analysis of expected response times).
    2.  **Set Timeouts in Typhoeus:** Use the `timeout` (overall timeout in seconds) and `connecttimeout` (connection timeout in seconds) options *every time* you make a request with Typhoeus.  *Do not rely on default timeouts.*  Tailor these values to the specific endpoint being accessed.
    3.  **Example:**
        ```ruby
        Typhoeus.get(url, timeout: 10, connecttimeout: 2) # 10s overall, 2s connection
        Typhoeus.post(url, body: data, timeout: 5, connecttimeout: 1) # Different timeouts for a different endpoint
        ```
    4.  **Error Handling:** (Can be partially within Typhoeus - see below).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents slow responses from hanging the application.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. A global timeout is set, but it's not tailored, and `connecttimeout` is not used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Timeouts are not customized per endpoint. `connecttimeout` is unused.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Redirect Handling (using Typhoeus options and callbacks)](./mitigation_strategies/redirect_handling__using_typhoeus_options_and_callbacks_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limit Redirects:** Use the `maxredirs` option in Typhoeus to limit the maximum number of redirects.  A small value (e.g., 3-5) is recommended.
    2.  **Validate Redirect URLs (using Typhoeus callbacks):**  This is where we can leverage Typhoeus's features.  Use the `on_complete` callback (or similar, depending on the Typhoeus version) to inspect the response *after* redirects have been followed.  Check the final `response.effective_url` against your whitelist.
    3.  **Consider Manual Redirects:** For high-security situations, set `followlocation: false` and handle redirects *entirely* manually.  This gives you absolute control.
    4.  **Example (using `on_complete`):**
        ```ruby
        Typhoeus.get(url, maxredirs: 3, followlocation: true, on_complete: lambda do |response|
          if response.success?!
            # Check the final URL after redirects
            raise "Unsafe redirect!" unless is_safe_url?(response.effective_url)
          else
            # Handle other errors
          end
        end)
        ```
    5. **Example (Manual Redirects):**
         ```ruby
        response = Typhoeus.get(url, followlocation: false)

        if response.code >= 300 && response.code < 400 && response.headers['Location']
          redirect_url = response.headers['Location']
          # Validate redirect_url against whitelist, etc.
          raise "Invalid redirect URL" unless is_safe_url?(redirect_url)
          # Make a new request to the redirect_url
          response = Typhoeus.get(redirect_url)
        end
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity):** Prevents redirects to internal resources.
    *   **Open Redirect (Low Severity):** Prevents redirects to malicious sites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (with `on_complete` validation).
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `maxredirs` is set, but no `on_complete` validation or manual handling is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Redirect URL validation using `on_complete` or manual redirect handling is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Body Handling (with Typhoeus `body` and `headers`)](./mitigation_strategies/request_body_handling__with_typhoeus__body__and__headers__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Sources:** (External to Typhoeus).
    2.  **Define Expected Format:** (External to Typhoeus).
    3.  **Validation and Sanitization:** (External to Typhoeus - use appropriate libraries).
    4.  **Set `Content-Type` Header:** *Always* set the `Content-Type` header correctly when sending a request body.  Use Typhoeus's `headers` option for this.  This is crucial for the target server to interpret the body correctly.
    5.  **Pass Body Data:** Use Typhoeus's `body` option to pass the (validated and sanitized) request body.
    6.  **Example (JSON):**
        ```ruby
        # Assume data has been validated and sanitized as JSON
        Typhoeus.post(url, body: data.to_json, headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' })
        ```
    7. **Example (Form Data):**
        ```ruby
        # Assume params is a hash of form data
        Typhoeus.post(url, body: params, headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' })
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through external validation/sanitization).
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** (Indirectly).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (relies on external validation).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `Content-Type` is sometimes set, but not consistently.  The `body` option is used, but the data passed to it isn't always properly validated.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of `Content-Type`.  Consistent validation of data before passing it to `body`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Leak Prevention (using Typhoeus response handling)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_leak_prevention__using_typhoeus_response_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explicitly Close Responses:** If you are *not* using the entire response body, explicitly set `response.body = nil`. This releases the underlying resources.
    2.  **Streaming for Large Responses:** For very large responses, use Typhoeus's streaming capabilities (check Typhoeus documentation for `on_body` or similar callbacks). Process the response body in chunks *within the callback*.
    3.  **Example (Closing Response):**
        ```ruby
        response = Typhoeus.get(url)
        if response.success?!
          # Process a small part of the body
          puts response.body[0..100]
        end
        response.body = nil # Release the body
        ```
    4. **Example (Streaming - Conceptual, check Typhoeus docs for specifics):**
        ```ruby
        Typhoeus.get(url, on_body: lambda do |chunk, response|
          # Process each chunk of the body as it arrives
          process_data_chunk(chunk)
        end)
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents memory leaks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive memory use.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Response bodies are not consistently closed. Streaming is not used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit response closing and streaming are missing.
