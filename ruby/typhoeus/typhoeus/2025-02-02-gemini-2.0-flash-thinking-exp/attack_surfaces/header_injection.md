### 4. Deep Analysis of Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Understanding Header Injection in Typhoeus Context

Header injection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates untrusted data into HTTP headers without proper sanitization or validation. Typhoeus, as an HTTP client, provides developers with the flexibility to customize HTTP requests, including setting headers. This flexibility, while powerful, becomes a security risk if user-controlled input is directly used to construct headers without adequate security measures.

**How Typhoeus Facilitates Header Manipulation:**

Typhoeus allows setting custom headers through the `headers` option in its request methods (e.g., `Typhoeus.get`, `Typhoeus.post`, `Typhoeus::Request`).  Developers can pass a hash where keys represent header names and values represent header values.

```ruby
# Example of setting headers in Typhoeus (Ruby)
Typhoeus.get("https://example.com", headers: {
  "X-Custom-Header" => "user_provided_value", # Potentially vulnerable if user_provided_value is unsanitized
  "Another-Header" => "static_value"
})
```

If `user_provided_value` in the example above originates from user input (e.g., query parameters, form data, cookies) and is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious content into the header.

#### 4.2. Detailed Attack Vectors

Let's explore specific attack vectors for header injection in Typhoeus applications:

*   **Cookie Injection for Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Vector:** An attacker manipulates user input that is used to set the `Cookie` header in a Typhoeus request. They can inject a known session ID or a session ID from another user.
    *   **Scenario:** An application uses Typhoeus to communicate with a backend service. The application attempts to forward a user's session cookie to the backend. If the cookie value is taken directly from a user-controlled source (e.g., a query parameter intended for a different purpose but mistakenly used for the cookie header), an attacker can inject their own session ID.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful session hijacking allows the attacker to impersonate another user on the backend service, gaining unauthorized access to their data and actions.

*   **X-Forwarded-For Injection for Security Control Bypass:**
    *   **Vector:** Attackers inject malicious IP addresses or other values into the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
    *   **Scenario:** An application uses Typhoeus to communicate with a service that relies on IP-based access controls or logging based on the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If the application directly uses user input to set this header, an attacker can:
        *   **Bypass IP Whitelisting:** Inject a whitelisted IP address to gain access that should be restricted.
        *   **Obfuscate Origin:** Inject a fake IP address to hide their true origin and potentially evade security monitoring.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls can lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources, data breaches, and manipulation of application logic.

*   **Host Header Injection for Routing Manipulation and Potential SSRF:**
    *   **Vector:** Attackers inject malicious hostnames or IP addresses into the `Host` header.
    *   **Scenario:** While less common in typical client-side Typhoeus usage (as Typhoeus usually derives the `Host` header from the URL), if an application *explicitly* allows setting the `Host` header based on user input when making requests to internal services, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Routing Manipulation:**  The injected `Host` header might cause the backend service to route the request to a different virtual host or application, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or access to unintended resources.
        *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Potential:** In more complex scenarios, if the backend service processes the injected `Host` header and uses it to construct further requests (e.g., for redirects or internal resource access), it could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.

*   **Content-Type Injection for MIME Confusion:**
    *   **Vector:** Attackers inject malicious `Content-Type` headers.
    *   **Scenario:** If an application uses user input to determine the `Content-Type` header for requests sent via Typhoeus, an attacker could inject a misleading `Content-Type`.
    *   **Impact:**  This can lead to MIME confusion vulnerabilities on the receiving end. For example, injecting `Content-Type: text/html` when sending JSON data might cause the server to misinterpret the data, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) if the server processes and displays the data in a web context.

*   **Custom Header Injection for Application Logic Bypass:**
    *   **Vector:** Attackers inject malicious values into custom headers that are used by the application's logic.
    *   **Scenario:** Applications often use custom headers for various purposes, such as authentication, authorization, feature flags, or internal routing. If user input influences these custom headers, attackers can manipulate application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** The impact is highly application-specific but can range from bypassing authentication or authorization checks to altering application workflows and accessing privileged features.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of header injection vulnerabilities in Typhoeus applications can be significant and include:

*   **Session Hijacking:**  Complete takeover of user accounts and access to sensitive data.
*   **Security Control Bypass:** Circumvention of authentication, authorization, IP-based restrictions, and other security mechanisms.
*   **Data Exfiltration and Modification:**  Unauthorized access to and manipulation of data on backend services.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Potential for internal network scanning, access to internal resources, and further exploitation of backend systems.
*   **Application Logic Manipulation:**  Altering the intended behavior of the application, leading to unexpected outcomes and potential business logic flaws.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Security breaches resulting from header injection can severely damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.

Given these potential impacts, header injection vulnerabilities are generally considered **High Severity**.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Deep Dive)

To effectively mitigate header injection vulnerabilities in Typhoeus applications, a combination of strategies is recommended:

*   **4.4.1. Header Sanitization and Validation:**

    *   **Description:**  This is the most fundamental mitigation. Any user-provided input that is intended to be used in HTTP headers must be rigorously sanitized and validated before being passed to Typhoeus.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Define strict rules for what is considered valid input for each header. For example, if a header should only contain alphanumeric characters, enforce this rule.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape user input to neutralize any potentially malicious characters that could be interpreted as header delimiters or control characters.  For HTTP headers, this often involves escaping characters like newlines (`\n`, `\r`), colons (`:`), and potentially others depending on the context and specific header.
        *   **Regular Expressions (with caution):**  Use regular expressions to validate input against allowed patterns. However, be cautious with complex regexes as they can be error-prone and introduce new vulnerabilities if not carefully crafted.
        *   **Example (Conceptual - Ruby):**

        ```ruby
        def sanitize_header_value(header_value)
          # Example: Whitelist alphanumeric characters, spaces, and hyphens
          header_value.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s\-]/, '')
        end

        user_input = params[:custom_header] # User input from request
        sanitized_input = sanitize_header_value(user_input)

        Typhoeus.get("https://example.com", headers: {
          "X-Custom-Header" => sanitized_input
        })
        ```

    *   **Limitations:** Sanitization can be complex and error-prone. It's crucial to understand the specific requirements of each header and choose appropriate sanitization techniques. Whitelisting is generally preferred over blacklisting.

*   **4.4.2. Avoid User Input in Critical Headers:**

    *   **Description:** The most secure approach is to minimize or completely eliminate the use of user input in critical HTTP headers, especially those related to security context, session management, or routing (e.g., `Cookie`, `Authorization`, `Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`).
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Static Header Values:**  Use static, pre-defined values for critical headers whenever possible.
        *   **Indirect User Influence:** If user input *must* influence behavior related to these headers, consider using alternative mechanisms that don't involve directly setting the header value. For example, instead of allowing users to directly set the `Cookie` header, use a separate, controlled parameter that the application uses to *determine* which cookie to send (from a predefined set).
        *   **Backend-Driven Header Management:**  If possible, let the backend service manage session cookies and other critical headers. The application using Typhoeus should simply forward necessary authentication tokens or identifiers in a secure and controlled manner (e.g., in the request body or a dedicated, well-defined header).

    *   **Example (Conceptual - Instead of user-controlled Cookie header):**

        ```ruby
        user_session_id = get_user_session_identifier_securely(user) # Get session ID from secure session management

        Typhoeus.get("https://backend-service.com", headers: {
          "Authorization" => "Bearer #{user_session_id}" # Use Authorization header instead of Cookie if possible
        })
        ```

*   **4.4.3. Header Whitelisting:**

    *   **Description:**  Explicitly define a whitelist of allowed headers that the application is permitted to send using Typhoeus.  This restricts the attack surface by preventing the application from sending arbitrary headers, even if user input is involved.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Configuration-Based Whitelist:**  Maintain a configuration file or data structure that lists allowed header names.
        *   **Code-Level Enforcement:**  Implement logic in the application to check if a header being set is in the whitelist before sending the Typhoeus request.  Reject or ignore headers that are not whitelisted.
        *   **Example (Conceptual - Ruby):**

        ```ruby
        ALLOWED_HEADERS = ["X-Custom-Header", "Content-Type", "Accept"]

        def set_headers_safely(user_headers)
          safe_headers = {}
          user_headers.each do |header_name, header_value|
            if ALLOWED_HEADERS.include?(header_name)
              safe_headers[header_name] = header_value # Still need to sanitize header_value!
            else
              Rails.logger.warn("Header '#{header_name}' is not whitelisted and will be ignored.")
            end
          end
          safe_headers
        end

        user_provided_headers = {
          "X-Custom-Header" => params[:custom_header],
          "Malicious-Header" => "attacker_controlled_value" # Will be ignored
        }

        safe_headers = set_headers_safely(user_provided_headers)

        Typhoeus.get("https://example.com", headers: safe_headers)
        ```

    *   **Benefits:**  Reduces the attack surface significantly by limiting the headers that can be manipulated. Provides a clear and auditable control over outgoing headers.

*   **4.4.4. Secure Header Defaults and Minimal Headers:**

    *   **Description:**  Start with a secure baseline of default headers and avoid adding unnecessary or potentially harmful headers.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Review Default Typhoeus Headers:** Understand the default headers Typhoeus sends. Remove or modify any defaults that are not needed or could be problematic.
        *   **Explicitly Set Necessary Headers:** Only add headers that are strictly required for the application's functionality. Avoid adding headers "just in case."
        *   **Security-Focused Headers (Consideration):** While primarily for *response* headers, consider the principle of setting security-related request headers where applicable (though less common for client-side requests).  Focus on minimizing attack surface rather than adding response-style security headers to requests.

    *   **Example:**  If you don't need to specify a custom `User-Agent`, rely on Typhoeus's default or set a generic, non-revealing `User-Agent` instead of allowing user control.

#### 4.5. Testing and Verification

To ensure effective mitigation, thorough testing is crucial:

*   **Manual Testing:** Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or curl to manually craft requests with malicious header injections and observe the application's behavior. Test different header types and injection techniques.
*   **Automated Security Scanning (DAST):** Utilize Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools that can automatically probe for header injection vulnerabilities. Configure the scanner to specifically test header manipulation points.
*   **Static Code Analysis (SAST):** Employ Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to analyze the application's source code for potential header injection vulnerabilities. SAST can identify code paths where user input flows into header settings without proper sanitization.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write unit and integration tests that specifically target header handling logic. These tests should include scenarios with both valid and malicious header inputs to verify sanitization and validation mechanisms.

### 5. Conclusion

Header injection is a serious attack surface in applications using Typhoeus, stemming from the library's flexibility in setting HTTP headers. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies like header sanitization, avoiding user input in critical headers, header whitelisting, and secure defaults, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of header injection vulnerabilities. Continuous testing and vigilance are essential to maintain a secure application. Remember that a layered security approach, combining multiple mitigation techniques, provides the strongest defense.
