# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Improve application performance by enabling parallel HTTP requests to external services.
  - Reduce latency and response times for user interactions that depend on multiple external API calls.
  - Increase efficiency of data retrieval and processing from distributed systems.
  - Enhance scalability of applications by optimizing resource utilization through concurrent operations.

- Business Risks:
  - Dependency on an open-source library introduces potential vulnerabilities and maintenance overhead.
  - Performance bottlenecks in external APIs or network infrastructure can negate the benefits of parallel requests.
  - Improper handling of concurrent requests can lead to resource exhaustion or instability in the application or external services.
  - Security vulnerabilities in Typhoeus or its dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application or sensitive data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code Review - The Typhoeus library is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review of the code. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Dependency Management - Bundler is used for managing Ruby dependencies, which helps in specifying and resolving library dependencies. (Implemented: Gemfile)
  - security control: HTTPS Support - Typhoeus supports HTTPS for secure communication with external services. (Implemented: Library Code)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - Security vulnerabilities are primarily identified and addressed by the open-source community.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in Typhoeus's dependencies might exist and require updates.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in Typhoeus and its dependencies.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Integrate SCA tools into the development pipeline to continuously monitor and manage open-source components and their associated risks.
  - security control: Input Validation and Output Encoding - Ensure proper input validation and output encoding when using Typhoeus to construct and process HTTP requests and responses to prevent injection attacks.
  - security control: Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers - Implement rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns when making requests to external services using Typhoeus to prevent abuse and service disruptions.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: If Typhoeus is used to interact with authenticated APIs, ensure secure handling of API keys, tokens, or credentials. Use environment variables or secure vault solutions to manage secrets.
    - Requirement: Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization logic should be implemented within the application using Typhoeus, not within Typhoeus itself, as it is a client library.
    - Requirement: Ensure that the application using Typhoeus only requests and accesses data that the authenticated user is authorized to access from external APIs.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs used to construct HTTP requests made by Typhoeus, including URLs, headers, and request bodies, to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., HTTP header injection, request smuggling).
    - Requirement: Sanitize and validate responses received from external APIs before processing them within the application to prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Enforce HTTPS for all communication with external services using Typhoeus to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: If sensitive data is included in request bodies or needs to be stored locally (though not recommended for Typhoeus itself), ensure appropriate encryption at rest and in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - API Integrations: Reliant on external APIs for core functionality, data retrieval, or service delivery. Performance and reliability of these integrations are critical.
  - Application Performance: User experience is directly impacted by application response times. Typhoeus is used to improve performance, so its availability and correct functioning are important.
  - Data Aggregation and Processing: If the application aggregates data from multiple sources via APIs, the ability to do this efficiently and reliably is a critical process.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - API Request/Response Data: Sensitivity depends on the APIs being called. Could include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive business information.
  - Application Data: Data processed and stored by the Web Application. Sensitivity depends on the application's purpose.
  - Configuration Data: API keys, tokens, and other credentials used to access external APIs. Highly sensitive and must be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific external APIs will the Web Application interact with using Typhoeus? Knowing the APIs will help assess specific API-related security risks.
  - What type of data will be exchanged with these APIs? Understanding data sensitivity is crucial for risk assessment.
  - What is the expected volume of requests and concurrency levels when using Typhoeus? This will help in understanding performance and potential denial-of-service risks.
  - What are the specific performance goals that Typhoeus is intended to address? This will clarify the business criticality of Typhoeus.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the Web Application and its use of Typhoeus must adhere to?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary business goal is to improve application performance and efficiency through parallel API requests.
    - The application is business-critical and requires high availability and reliability.
    - The organization has a moderate risk appetite, balancing performance gains with security considerations.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - The organization follows basic secure development practices but may not have advanced security controls in place for open-source library usage.
    - Security is a concern, but performance optimization is also a high priority.
    - The application handles some level of sensitive data, requiring attention to data protection and confidentiality.
  - DESIGN:
    - The Web Application is deployed in a containerized environment on Kubernetes in the cloud.
    - The build process is automated using a CI/CD pipeline.
    - HTTPS is used for all communication with external APIs.
    - API keys or tokens are used for authentication with external APIs, and these are managed securely (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management).
