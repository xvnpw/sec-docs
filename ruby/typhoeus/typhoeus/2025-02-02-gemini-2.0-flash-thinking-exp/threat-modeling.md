# Threat Model Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in Typhoeus](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_typhoeus.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in the Typhoeus library code itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to the application that trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
* **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impact could range from data breaches and system compromise to application downtime.
* **Typhoeus Component:** Core Typhoeus library code.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update Typhoeus to the latest stable version.
    * Subscribe to security advisories for Typhoeus and its dependencies.
    * Implement automated dependency scanning in the development pipeline.


## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in libcurl](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_libcurl.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in libcurl, the underlying C library used by Typhoeus.  Since Typhoeus relies on libcurl for HTTP communication, vulnerabilities in libcurl directly affect Typhoeus-based applications. Exploitation could involve sending malicious requests that trigger libcurl vulnerabilities, leading to similar impacts as Typhoeus vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:**  Similar to Typhoeus vulnerabilities, impact can range from data breaches and system compromise to application downtime.
* **Typhoeus Component:**  Underlying libcurl dependency.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure libcurl is up-to-date on the system where the application is deployed.
    * Monitor libcurl security advisories.
    * Use system package managers to manage and update libcurl.
    * Consider using container images with regularly updated base images including libcurl.


## Threat: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack if the application's Typhoeus configuration uses weak or outdated SSL/TLS settings. This allows the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and external services, stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious content.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity of data in transit compromised. Potential data breaches, data manipulation, and reputational damage.
* **Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` SSL/TLS configuration options (e.g., `ssl_verifyhost`, `ssl_verifypeer`, `sslversion`, `ciphers`).
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) using `sslversion`.
    * Use strong cipher suites.
    * Enable and properly configure certificate verification (`ssl_verifyhost: 2`, `ssl_verifypeer: true`).
    * Regularly review and update SSL/TLS configurations based on security best practices.


## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses Typhoeus to fetch resources based on user-controlled input and follows redirects, an attacker could manipulate the initial URL or a redirect response to force the application to make requests to internal resources or unintended external services. This can be used to access sensitive internal data, bypass firewalls, or perform actions on behalf of the server.
* **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
* **Typhoeus Component:** Redirect handling mechanism within `Typhoeus::Request` and `Typhoeus::Hydra`, URL parsing.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided input used to construct URLs.
    * Use URL parsing libraries to validate and normalize URLs.
    * Consider a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for outbound requests.
    * Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.


## Threat: [Insecure Proxy Configuration](./threats/insecure_proxy_configuration.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses proxies configured insecurely (e.g., weak authentication, compromised proxy server), an attacker could intercept or manipulate traffic passing through the proxy. This could lead to data theft, data manipulation, or injection of malicious content.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity of data in transit compromised, potential data breaches, data manipulation, and reputational damage.
* **Typhoeus Component:** Proxy configuration options in `Typhoeus::Request` (e.g., `proxy`, `proxyuserpwd`).
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Only use trusted and necessary proxies.
    * Securely manage proxy credentials, avoid hardcoding them.
    * Consider using authenticated proxies where appropriate.
    * Use environment variables or secure configuration management for proxy settings.


## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** If the target URL for Typhoeus requests is constructed using user-provided input without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the URL to make requests to internal resources (e.g., internal services, metadata endpoints) or unintended external services. This allows attackers to bypass security controls and potentially gain unauthorized access or perform actions on behalf of the server.
* **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, privilege escalation.
* **Typhoeus Component:** `Typhoeus::Request` URL construction, URL parsing.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided input used to construct URLs for Typhoeus requests.
    * Use URL parsing libraries to validate and normalize URLs.
    * Consider using a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for outbound requests.
    * Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.


## Threat: [Libcurl Version Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/libcurl_version_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Different versions of libcurl have different vulnerabilities. If the application is deployed with a vulnerable version of libcurl (even if Typhoeus itself is up-to-date), the application remains vulnerable to libcurl exploits. Attackers could exploit these libcurl vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests.
* **Impact:** Similar to general dependency vulnerabilities, impact can range from data breaches and system compromise to application downtime, depending on the specific libcurl vulnerability.
* **Typhoeus Component:** Underlying libcurl dependency.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure the libcurl version used in the deployment environment is patched against known vulnerabilities.
    * Consider compiling Typhoeus against a regularly updated and security-maintained libcurl version.
    * Regularly update the operating system or base container image to ensure libcurl is up-to-date.
    * Monitor security advisories for libcurl and the operating system/distribution in use.
