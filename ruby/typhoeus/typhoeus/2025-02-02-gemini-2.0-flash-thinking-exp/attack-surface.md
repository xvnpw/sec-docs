# Attack Surface Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/url_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URLs used by the application, leading to unintended actions like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or access to internal resources.
    *   **Typhoeus Contribution:** Typhoeus makes HTTP requests to URLs provided by the application. If the application uses unsanitized user input to construct URLs for Typhoeus, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a URL parameter to point to an internal server (e.g., `http://internal.service/sensitive-data`) when the application uses Typhoeus to fetch content based on this parameter, resulting in SSRF.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), access to internal resources, data exfiltration, bypassing access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used to construct URLs before passing them to Typhoeus.
        *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Whitelist allowed domains or URL patterns to restrict Typhoeus requests to trusted destinations.
        *   **URL Parsing and Sanitization Libraries:** Utilize robust URL parsing and sanitization libraries to ensure URLs are safe.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Network):** Restrict network access from the application server to only necessary external resources.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers to modify request behavior, potentially leading to session hijacking or bypassing security controls.
    *   **Typhoeus Contribution:** Typhoeus allows setting custom HTTP headers. If the application uses unsanitized user input to influence headers sent by Typhoeus, header injection vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a `Cookie` header with a known session ID or a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass IP-based access controls when the application uses Typhoeus to communicate with another service.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, bypassing security controls, modifying request behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Header Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used to construct HTTP headers before passing them to Typhoeus.
        *   **Avoid User Input in Critical Headers:** Minimize or eliminate user input in critical headers like `Cookie`, `Authorization`, or `Host`.
        *   **Header Whitelisting:** Whitelist allowed headers and their values to restrict headers Typhoeus can send.
        *   **Secure Header Defaults:** Use secure default headers and avoid adding unnecessary or harmful headers.

## Attack Surface: [Body Injection (specifically XXE)](./attack_surfaces/body_injection__specifically_xxe_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into the request body, specifically targeting XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Typhoeus Contribution:** Typhoeus sends request bodies as provided by the application. If the application constructs XML request bodies using unsanitized user input, XXE vulnerabilities can be exploited if the target server processes XML.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious XML code into a request body sent by Typhoeus, exploiting an XXE vulnerability on the target server if it parses XML without proper safeguards.
    *   **Impact:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection, potentially leading to sensitive file access, SSRF, or denial of service on the target server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Body Sanitization and Encoding:** Sanitize and properly encode user input before embedding it into XML request bodies. Use XML-specific escaping.
        *   **Use Safe Data Formats:** Prefer safer data formats like JSON over XML if possible, as JSON is less prone to XXE.
        *   **Disable XXE Processing (if applicable):** If using XML, disable external entity processing on the server-side to mitigate XXE vulnerabilities.
        *   **Content Type Validation:** Validate and enforce expected content types for requests to prevent unexpected processing of malicious payloads.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (libcurl)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__libcurl_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying `libcurl` library, which Typhoeus depends on, can directly impact applications using Typhoeus.
    *   **Typhoeus Contribution:** Typhoeus is a wrapper around `libcurl`. Security vulnerabilities in `libcurl` are inherited by Typhoeus and applications using it.
    *   **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability in `libcurl` could be exploited by a malicious server or crafted network response, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the application using Typhoeus.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, various protocol-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `libcurl` updated to the latest stable version. This is often managed by the system package manager or Ruby environment tools.
        *   **Typhoeus Updates:** Keep Typhoeus gem updated to benefit from any patches or dependency updates included in newer versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies, including `libcurl`, for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration and Option Misuse (Insecure SSL Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_and_option_misuse__insecure_ssl_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configuration of Typhoeus options, specifically disabling SSL certificate verification, weakens security and introduces Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack risks.
    *   **Typhoeus Contribution:** Typhoeus offers options to control SSL verification. Misconfiguring these options, especially disabling verification, creates a significant security vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Disabling SSL certificate verification (`ssl_verifyhost: false`, `ssl_verifypeer: false`) in Typhoeus configuration, even temporarily for debugging, and accidentally leaving it disabled in production. This exposes the application to MITM attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, credential compromise, weakened security posture.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Secure Defaults:** Rely on Typhoeus's secure default configurations, which include SSL certificate verification.
        *   **Avoid Disabling SSL Verification:** Do not disable SSL certificate verification unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks and alternative mitigations. Document and justify any deviations from secure defaults.
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Manage Typhoeus configuration securely and avoid hardcoding insecure options in code.
        *   **Regular Configuration Review:** Periodically review Typhoeus configurations to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices.
