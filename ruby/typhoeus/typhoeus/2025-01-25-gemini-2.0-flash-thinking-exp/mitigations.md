# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL for All Outbound Requests via Typhoeus Options](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl_for_all_outbound_requests_via_typhoeus_options.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Typhoeus SSL options:** When creating Typhoeus requests, explicitly set the following options to enforce TLS/SSL and certificate verification:
        *   `ssl_verifypeer: true`: Enables verification of the peer's SSL certificate.
        *   `ssl_verifyhost: 2`: Enables verification that the certificate hostname matches the requested hostname.
    2.  **Configure globally (if possible):** If your application structure allows, set these options as defaults for all Typhoeus requests to ensure consistent enforcement. This might involve creating a wrapper or configuration function for Typhoeus.
    3.  **Code review for option presence:** During code reviews, specifically check that `ssl_verifypeer: true` and `ssl_verifyhost: 2` are present in Typhoeus request options, or enforced globally.
    4.  **Avoid disabling SSL verification:**  Strictly prohibit disabling SSL verification by setting `ssl_verifypeer: false` or `ssl_verifyhost: 0` in production code, except for explicitly documented and justified exceptions (e.g., testing against local, self-signed certificates in development environments only).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Without SSL verification, Typhoeus is vulnerable to MITM attacks where attackers can intercept and manipulate communication.
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):**  Using HTTP or disabling SSL allows data transmitted by Typhoeus to be intercepted and read in plaintext.
    *   **Spoofing (Medium to High Severity):**  Without hostname verification, Typhoeus could connect to a malicious server impersonating the intended legitimate server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High reduction in risk. Enforcing `ssl_verifypeer` and `ssl_verifyhost` directly mitigates MITM attacks against Typhoeus requests.
    *   **Data Exposure:** High reduction in risk.  SSL encryption enforced by these options protects data transmitted by Typhoeus.
    *   **Spoofing:** Medium to High reduction in risk. `ssl_verifyhost` helps prevent connection to spoofed servers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  `ssl_verifypeer` and `ssl_verifyhost` are used in some parts of the application, but not consistently enforced across all Typhoeus usages.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a project-wide standard to always include `ssl_verifypeer: true` and `ssl_verifyhost: 2` in Typhoeus request options.
    *   Create a helper function or wrapper for Typhoeus requests that automatically includes these options.
    *   Implement automated checks (e.g., linters or static analysis) to ensure these options are present in all Typhoeus request configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Appropriate Timeouts in Typhoeus Options](./mitigation_strategies/set_appropriate_timeouts_in_typhoeus_options.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Typhoeus timeout options:**  Configure the following Typhoeus options to prevent indefinite hangs and resource exhaustion:
        *   `timeout`: Sets the maximum time (in seconds) for the entire request, including connection, sending, and receiving data.
        *   `connecttimeout`: Sets the maximum time (in seconds) to establish a connection to the server.
        *   `nosignal: true`:  Prevents signals from interrupting long-running requests, ensuring timeouts are handled by Typhoeus itself.
    2.  **Define timeout values based on context:**  Determine appropriate timeout values for different types of Typhoeus requests based on expected response times and network conditions.
    3.  **Apply timeouts consistently:** Ensure timeout options are set for all Typhoeus requests throughout the application.
    4.  **Monitor timeout errors:** Implement logging and monitoring to track timeout errors from Typhoeus, which can indicate network issues or slow external services.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Without timeouts, slow or unresponsive external services can cause Typhoeus requests to block indefinitely, consuming server resources.
    *   **Application Hangs and Instability (Medium Severity):**  Hanging Typhoeus requests can lead to application unresponsiveness and instability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction in risk. Typhoeus timeout options directly prevent resource exhaustion caused by hanging requests initiated by Typhoeus.
    *   **Application Hangs and Instability:** Medium reduction in risk. Timeouts improve application stability by preventing Typhoeus requests from causing indefinite hangs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Timeouts are used in some Typhoeus requests, but not consistently across the application. Specific timeout values are not always well-defined or context-aware.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a project-wide standard for timeout values to be used with Typhoeus, categorized by request type or context.
    *   Create a utility function or configuration to easily apply these standard timeouts to all Typhoeus requests.
    *   Regularly review and adjust timeout values based on performance monitoring and observed network behavior.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Redirects Carefully using Typhoeus Options](./mitigation_strategies/handle_redirects_carefully_using_typhoeus_options.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Control redirect behavior with `followlocation` and `maxredirs`:**  Use Typhoeus options to manage redirects:
        *   `followlocation: true` (default): Enables following HTTP redirects.
        *   `followlocation: false`: Disables following redirects.
        *   `maxredirs: <integer>`: Limits the maximum number of redirects to follow.
    2.  **Limit redirects for external/untrusted URLs:** When making requests to external or untrusted URLs, consider limiting the number of redirects using `maxredirs` to prevent redirect loops or excessive resource consumption.
    3.  **Inspect redirect URLs (advanced):** For sensitive operations, implement custom redirect handling using Typhoeus callbacks (e.g., `on_headers`) to inspect redirect URLs before automatically following them. This allows for validation of redirect destinations.
    4.  **Disable redirects if not needed:** If redirects are not expected or necessary for a particular Typhoeus request, explicitly disable them using `followlocation: false`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect (Low to Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled redirects can be exploited to redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   **Redirect Loops (Low Severity - DoS potential):**  Following an excessive number of redirects, especially in loops, can consume resources and potentially lead to denial of service.
    *   **SSRF Amplification (Medium Severity):** In SSRF scenarios, uncontrolled redirects could be used to reach unexpected internal or external targets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** Low to Medium reduction in risk. Limiting or controlling redirects in Typhoeus reduces the risk of open redirect exploitation.
    *   **Redirect Loops:** Low reduction in risk. `maxredirs` prevents resource exhaustion from redirect loops initiated by Typhoeus.
    *   **SSRF Amplification:** Medium reduction in risk. Controlling redirects can limit the scope of potential SSRF attacks involving Typhoeus.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Inconsistently implemented. Redirect following is generally enabled by default. `maxredirs` is rarely configured explicitly. Custom redirect handling or inspection is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish guidelines for when and how to control redirects in Typhoeus requests, especially for external URLs.
    *   Implement a default `maxredirs` limit for Typhoeus requests to external domains.
    *   Consider implementing a mechanism for inspecting redirect URLs in sensitive contexts to validate redirect destinations before following them.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Proxy Configuration via Typhoeus Options (If Used)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_proxy_configuration_via_typhoeus_options__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure proxy settings using Typhoeus options:** If using a proxy server, configure proxy settings using Typhoeus options:
        *   `proxy`:  Specifies the proxy server URL (e.g., `http://proxy.example.com:8080`).
        *   `proxyuserpwd`:  Specifies proxy authentication credentials (e.g., `"username:password"`).
        *   `proxytype`: Specifies the proxy type (e.g., `:http`, `:socks4`, `:socks5`).
    2.  **Securely manage proxy credentials:** If proxy authentication is required, store and manage proxy credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code. Use environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration files.
    3.  **Use HTTPS proxies (recommended):**  If possible, use HTTPS proxies to encrypt communication between Typhoeus and the proxy server itself.
    4.  **Validate proxy configuration:** Ensure the proxy configuration is correct and points to a trusted and properly secured proxy server.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Proxy Credential Exposure (High Severity if credentials are compromised):**  If proxy credentials are hardcoded or insecurely stored, they can be exposed and misused.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Proxy Connection (Medium Severity if using HTTP proxy):**  If using an HTTP proxy, the connection between Typhoeus and the proxy server is not encrypted and could be vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    *   **Unauthorized Proxy Usage (Low to Medium Severity):**  Incorrect or misconfigured proxy settings could lead to unintended proxy usage or bypassing security controls.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Proxy Credential Exposure:** High reduction in risk if credentials are managed securely. Secure credential management directly addresses this threat.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Proxy Connection:** Medium reduction in risk if using HTTPS proxies. HTTPS encryption protects the proxy connection.
    *   **Unauthorized Proxy Usage:** Low to Medium reduction in risk through proper configuration and validation. Correct configuration prevents unintended proxy usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not consistently implemented. Proxy usage is limited, and secure proxy configuration practices are not formally defined or enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish secure proxy configuration guidelines for Typhoeus, including secure credential management practices.
    *   If proxy usage is required, implement a secure method for storing and retrieving proxy credentials (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets manager).
    *   Document and enforce the use of HTTPS proxies where possible.
