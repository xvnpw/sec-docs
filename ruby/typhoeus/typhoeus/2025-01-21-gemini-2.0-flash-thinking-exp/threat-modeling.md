# Threat Model Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is used to construct the URL for a Typhoeus request. The application then uses Typhoeus to make a request to an unintended destination, potentially internal resources or arbitrary external URLs. The attacker might use this to scan internal networks, access internal services, or perform actions on behalf of the server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service against internal services, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.

**Affected Typhoeus Component:** URL handling during request construction (e.g., when using `Typhoeus::Request.new` with user-provided URL parts).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences the request URL.
*   Implement a whitelist of allowed destination hosts or URL patterns.
*   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs. Use predefined base URLs and append validated parameters.
*   Consider using a dedicated service or proxy for outbound requests with stricter controls.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into HTTP headers sent by Typhoeus by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to set headers. This can lead to various issues depending on the injected header and the target server's behavior. For example, injecting `Host` header can lead to routing issues, or injecting caching-related headers can cause cache poisoning.

**Impact:** Cache poisoning, session fixation, potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the target server reflects the injected header, bypassing security controls.

**Affected Typhoeus Component:** Header handling during request construction (e.g., when using the `headers` option in `Typhoeus::Request.new`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly incorporating user input into HTTP headers.
*   Use Typhoeus's built-in methods for setting headers, which often provide some level of encoding or validation.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data used in headers.
*   Consider using predefined header values where possible.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure in Requests](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_in_requests.md)

**Description:** The application inadvertently includes sensitive data (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens, personal information) in the request body, headers, or URL parameters when making requests using Typhoeus. An attacker intercepting the request or compromising the destination server could gain access to this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of user accounts or sensitive information.

**Affected Typhoeus Component:** Request construction (handling of `body`, `params`, and `headers` options in `Typhoeus::Request.new`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review all data being sent in Typhoeus requests.
*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code.
*   Utilize secure methods for managing and injecting sensitive data (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
*   Ensure HTTPS is used for all sensitive requests to encrypt data in transit.
*   Implement logging practices that avoid logging sensitive request data.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Description:** If the application deserializes response data from external services obtained through Typhoeus without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the response data to inject malicious payloads. This can lead to remote code execution on the application server if the deserialization process is vulnerable. This is particularly relevant if the application interacts with services returning serialized data formats like YAML or Marshal.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application server.

**Affected Typhoeus Component:** Response handling (processing the `response.body` after a Typhoeus request).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods and libraries.
*   Implement strict validation of the structure and content of the deserialized data before processing it.
*   Consider using safer data exchange formats like JSON where possible.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured TLS/SSL settings in Typhoeus can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or exposure of data in transit. This includes disabling certificate verification, using outdated TLS protocols, or ignoring certificate errors. An attacker could intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and external services.

**Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of communication, loss of confidentiality and integrity.

**Affected Typhoeus Component:** Connection handling and SSL/TLS configuration (e.g., options like `ssl_verifypeer`, `sslcert`, `sslkey` in `Typhoeus::Request.new` or global configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure certificate verification is enabled and properly configured (`ssl_verifypeer: true`).
*   Use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols.
*   Regularly review and update Typhoeus and its underlying dependencies (like `ethon`).
*   Avoid explicitly disabling certificate verification unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks.
