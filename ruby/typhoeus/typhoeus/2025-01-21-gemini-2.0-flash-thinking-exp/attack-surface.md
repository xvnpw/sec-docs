# Attack Surface Analysis for typhoeus/typhoeus

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an unintended location.

**How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus is the direct mechanism through which the application makes outbound HTTP requests. If the destination URL or parts of it are influenced by user input without proper validation, Typhoeus will execute the request to the attacker-controlled destination.

**Example:** An application allows users to provide a URL for fetching remote content. If the application uses Typhoeus to fetch this URL directly without sanitization, an attacker could provide an internal IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10/admin`) to access internal resources.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, denial of service against internal services, and potentially executing arbitrary code on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application might be configured to bypass or weaken TLS/SSL security when making requests through Typhoeus.

**How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus provides options to disable certificate verification (`ssl_verifypeer: false`, `ssl_verifystatus: false`) or use insecure cipher suites. If developers use these options without understanding the implications, it weakens the security of the connection.

**Example:** A developer disables `ssl_verifypeer` in Typhoeus to connect to a server with a self-signed certificate in a production environment, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, potential for data manipulation by attackers.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Requests](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_requests.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is included in the HTTP requests made by Typhoeus.

**How Typhoeus Contributes:** Developers might inadvertently include API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive data directly in the URLs, headers, or request bodies used by Typhoeus.

**Example:** An API key is hardcoded into a URL used by Typhoeus to access a third-party service. This key could be exposed in logs or through network monitoring.

**Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access to third-party services, potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (Hydra)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__hydra_.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist in the `hydra-ruby` gem, which Typhoeus relies on.

**How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus directly uses the functionality provided by `hydra-ruby`. Any vulnerabilities in `hydra-ruby` can be exploited through Typhoeus.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of `hydra-ruby` allows for arbitrary code execution when processing certain types of HTTP responses. An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by making the application request a malicious resource.

**Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in `hydra-ruby`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)

## Attack Surface: [Proxy Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/proxy_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured proxy settings in Typhoeus can lead to security vulnerabilities.

**How Typhoeus Contributes:** Typhoeus allows configuring proxy servers for outbound requests. Misconfigurations, such as using untrusted proxies or allowing user-controlled proxy settings, can introduce risks.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify a proxy server for their requests. An attacker could provide a malicious proxy server to intercept or modify traffic.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential for routing traffic through attacker-controlled infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High
