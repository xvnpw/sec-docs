## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Request Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE: Request Handling]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_request_manipulation__critical_node_request_handling_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on manipulating the HTTP requests made by the application using Typhoeus. The attacker aims to control aspects of the request to achieve malicious goals.
*   **Critical Node: Request Handling:** This represents the overall process of constructing and sending HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities at this stage can have wide-ranging consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Headers](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_headers.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious or unexpected HTTP headers into the requests sent by Typhoeus. This can be achieved if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate header values before passing them to Typhoeus.
*   **Critical Node: Application Header Handling:** This highlights the application's responsibility in ensuring the integrity and safety of HTTP headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Gain unauthorized access or cause denial of service by injecting headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `Host`, etc.](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__gain_unauthorized_access_or_cause_denial_of_service_by_injecting_headers_like__x-fo_aa2b6af8.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, an attacker might bypass IP-based access controls or logging mechanisms. Injecting a malicious `Host` header could lead to routing errors or exploitation of virtual hosting vulnerabilities on the target server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Target URL](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_target_url.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the target URL of the HTTP request made by Typhoeus. This can be done if the application dynamically constructs URLs based on user input without proper sanitization.
*   **Critical Node: Application URL Construction:** This emphasizes the importance of secure URL construction within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Redirect Typhoeus to malicious endpoints, potentially leaking data or performing unauthorized actions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__redirect_typhoeus_to_malicious_endpoints__potentially_leaking_data_or_performing_un_68a6f25f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the URL, the attacker can force Typhoeus to send requests to unintended destinations. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), where the application is tricked into making requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the attacker, potentially leaking sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Request Body](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_request_body.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious content into the body of the HTTP request sent by Typhoeus. This is possible if the application includes user-controlled data in the request body without proper sanitization.
*   **Critical Node: Application Data Handling:** This highlights the need for careful handling and sanitization of data that ends up in the request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or inject malicious payloads into backend systems](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__perform_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__or_inject_malicious_payloads_into_backen_31e18580.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to URL manipulation, a malicious request body can be used to perform SSRF. Additionally, if the backend system processes the request body without proper validation, the attacker might be able to inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection if the data is used in a database query).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Response Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE: Response Handling]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_response_manipulation__critical_node_response_handling_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on manipulating the HTTP responses received by the application through Typhoeus. The attacker aims to inject malicious content into the response that the application will process as legitimate data.
*   **Critical Node: Response Handling:** This represents the overall process of receiving and processing HTTP responses. Insecure handling here can lead to significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Response Handling by Application](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_response_handling_by_application.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application trusts and processes responses from external servers without proper validation. This allows an attacker who can control the response to inject malicious content.
*   **Critical Node: Application Response Processing:** This emphasizes the application's responsibility in validating and sanitizing incoming data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject malicious content into the response that the application interprets as legitimate data](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_content_into_the_response_that_the_application_interprets_as_legit_26de7f53.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By controlling the response, an attacker can inject malicious scripts or HTML. If the application renders this response in a web browser, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Alternatively, the malicious content could manipulate the application's internal logic if it's processed without proper validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application disables SSL/TLS verification or uses weak ciphers when making requests with Typhoeus. This weakens the security of the connection.
*   **Critical Node: Typhoeus Configuration:** This highlights the importance of secure configuration of the Typhoeus library.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to intercept or modify communication](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__perform_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_to_intercept_or_modify_communication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If SSL/TLS verification is disabled or weak ciphers are used, an attacker positioned between the application and the target server can intercept and potentially modify the communication, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE: Typhoeus Dependencies]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_typhoeus_dependencies_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Typhoeus relies on external libraries (dependencies) like libcurl. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise Typhoeus or the application.
*   **Critical Node: Typhoeus Dependencies:** This emphasizes the importance of managing and updating the dependencies of the Typhoeus library.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries to compromise Typhoeus's functionality or the application itself](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_libraries_to_compromise_typhoeus's__0bc00c6a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in dependencies can range from denial of service to remote code execution. If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in a Typhoeus dependency, they might gain control over the application server or its data.
