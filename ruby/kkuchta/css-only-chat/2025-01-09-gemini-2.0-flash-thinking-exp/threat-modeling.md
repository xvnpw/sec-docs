# Threat Model Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Threat: [Eavesdropping on Conversations](./threats/eavesdropping_on_conversations.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inspect the page's source code or use browser developer tools to observe the CSS state changes (e.g., which radio buttons are checked) that represent messages being sent and received. By monitoring these changes, they can reconstruct the conversation content.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality for the chat messages. Attackers can read private communications.

**Affected Component:** CSS selectors for message display and state management (e.g., `:checked` on input elements).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Inform users: Clearly communicate that this chat mechanism is inherently insecure and not suitable for sensitive information.
* Limit use cases: Restrict the use of this mechanism to non-sensitive or public communication.
* Avoid sensitive information: Do not transmit any confidential or private data through this chat.

## Threat: [Message Injection](./threats/message_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with the ability to manipulate the DOM or CSS (e.g., through a browser extension or by being a malicious user with access to modify the page) can directly alter the CSS state to inject arbitrary "messages" into the chat.

**Impact:** Compromised integrity of the chat log. False or malicious messages can be attributed to other users or appear as legitimate communication.

**Affected Component:** HTML input elements (radio buttons, checkboxes) used for state management, CSS selectors that style message display based on this state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Limit DOM manipulation: Implement strong security measures to prevent unauthorized DOM manipulation (though this is a general web security concern, it's crucial here).
* Inform users: Educate users that the displayed messages might not be authentic if their browser or system is compromised.
* Consider this mechanism as inherently untrusted: Do not rely on this chat for critical or verified communication.

## Threat: [Message Modification](./threats/message_modification.md)

**Description:** Similar to message injection, an attacker can modify existing "messages" by altering the CSS state associated with them, changing the content that is displayed.

**Impact:** Compromised integrity of the chat log. Original messages can be altered, leading to miscommunication or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** HTML input elements and associated CSS selectors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Same as Message Injection: Focus on preventing unauthorized DOM manipulation.
* Treat the displayed content as volatile: Understand that the displayed messages are not persistent or tamper-proof.

## Threat: [Sending Messages as Another User (Spoofing)](./threats/sending_messages_as_another_user__spoofing_.md)

**Description:** Due to the lack of inherent authentication in the CSS-only mechanism, an attacker can easily manipulate the CSS state to send messages appearing to originate from another user.

**Impact:** Users can be impersonated, leading to miscommunication, confusion, or potentially malicious actions attributed to the wrong person.

**Affected Component:** The mechanism for associating CSS state changes with a particular user (typically absent in pure `css-only-chat`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Acknowledge inherent lack of authentication: Understand that this mechanism does not provide sender verification.
* Do not rely on this for identity verification: Avoid using this chat for situations where verifying the sender is important.
* Inform users: Make it clear that messages cannot be reliably attributed to a specific user.
