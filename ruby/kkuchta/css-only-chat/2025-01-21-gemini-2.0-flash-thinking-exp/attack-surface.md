# Attack Surface Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Attack Surface: [Malicious URL Fragment Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_url_fragment_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL with a specific fragment (`#`) designed to manipulate the CSS state and behavior of other users' browsers.
    *   **How CSS-Only Chat Contributes:** The application relies entirely on URL fragments to represent and transmit chat messages and state changes. This makes it a direct input vector for controlling the application's logic via CSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a link containing a fragment like `#user-X:show-malicious-content` where the CSS rules are designed to display misleading information or trigger unwanted actions on user X's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Visual defacement, information disclosure (by revealing hidden elements), client-side denial of service (by injecting complex CSS), social engineering attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict sanitization or encoding of any data reflected in CSS selectors or state changes. Consider if there are ways to abstract the direct mapping between URL fragments and CSS rules. Explore if server-side validation or transformation of messages before they influence CSS is feasible (though challenging in a truly CSS-only context).
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking on links from untrusted sources within the chat. Use browser extensions that might offer some level of CSS filtering (though this is not a reliable solution).
