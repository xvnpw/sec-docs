Objective: Compromise the application utilizing the `css-only-chat` mechanism.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: Leverage Chat for Broader Application Attack
    *   AND: Social Engineering via Manipulated Chat
        *   CRITICAL NODE: Impersonation
            *   Use CSS to mimic the appearance of another user's messages to trick other participants.
        *   CRITICAL NODE: Spreading Misinformation
            *   Inject misleading or malicious content disguised as legitimate messages.
*   OR: Directly Manipulate Chat Communication
    *   AND: Content Manipulation / Injection
        *   CRITICAL NODE: Inject Misleading Content via CSS
            *   Use CSS `content` property on pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) to inject fake messages or alter the appearance of existing messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering via Manipulated Chat](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_via_manipulated_chat.md)

**Social Engineering via Manipulated Chat:**
    *   This represents a high-risk path because it leverages the inherent trust users place in visual information within the application. By manipulating the chat's appearance, an attacker can trick users into divulging sensitive information, performing unintended actions, or losing trust in the platform. The reliance on CSS for displaying messages makes this type of manipulation feasible if CSS injection is possible.

**Impersonation:**
    *   This is a critical node within the social engineering path.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects CSS rules that alter the appearance of their messages to perfectly match the styling of another legitimate user. This includes the username display, message bubble style, and any other visual cues that identify a user.
    *   **Impact:** Successful impersonation can lead to:
        *   Gaining the trust of other users, making them more likely to believe false information or follow malicious instructions.
        *   Soliciting sensitive information under the guise of a trusted individual.
        *   Damaging the reputation of the impersonated user.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the injection of arbitrary CSS is crucial. Additionally, mechanisms to verify user identity beyond visual cues could be considered, although challenging within the constraints of `css-only-chat`.

**Spreading Misinformation:**
    *   This is another critical node within the social engineering path.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects CSS rules, potentially using the `content` property on pseudo-elements, to insert false or misleading information into the chat stream. This information can be disguised as coming from any user, including legitimate ones if combined with impersonation.
    *   **Impact:** Spreading misinformation can:
        *   Damage the credibility of the application and the information shared within it.
        *   Influence user behavior in undesirable ways.
        *   Potentially cause real-world harm depending on the context of the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  A robust CSP is the primary defense. Content monitoring (though difficult with CSS-only chat) and user education about the potential for manipulation can also help.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Misleading Content via CSS](./attack_tree_paths/inject_misleading_content_via_css.md)

**Inject Misleading Content via CSS:**
    *   This is a critical node within the direct manipulation of chat communication.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the ability to inject CSS to directly manipulate the displayed content of messages. This is primarily achieved using the `content` property on CSS pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`). The attacker can insert arbitrary text before or after existing messages, or even completely replace the visual representation of a message.
    *   **Impact:** Injecting misleading content can:
        *   Cause confusion and misinterpretations within the conversation.
        *   Trick users into believing false statements or taking incorrect actions.
        *   Disrupt the flow of communication and reduce the usability of the chat.
    *   **Mitigation:**  A strict CSP that restricts the sources from which CSS can be loaded and limits the use of inline styles is essential. Careful review of any application features that might allow CSS injection is also necessary.
