# Threat Model Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Threat: [Cross-User Information Leakage via Shared State](./threats/cross-user_information_leakage_via_shared_state.md)

**Description:** An attacker could observe the shared CSS state (e.g., the `:checked` status of a radio button) that corresponds to another user's message being sent. By monitoring these state changes, the attacker can infer the content of messages not intended for them. This directly exploits the communication mechanism of `css-only-chat`.

**Impact:** Confidential messages intended for specific users could be read by unauthorized individuals.

**Affected Component:** CSS Selectors and State Management Logic

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Introduce per-user or per-session unique identifiers in the CSS selectors to isolate state. This would require modifications to the fundamental `css-only-chat` approach.
*   Implement rate limiting on state changes to make observation more difficult.

## Threat: [Information Leakage via CSS Selectors and Attribute Values](./threats/information_leakage_via_css_selectors_and_attribute_values.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inspect the page source or use browser developer tools to examine the CSS selectors and attribute values used for state management within the `css-only-chat` implementation. If message content or user identifiers are directly embedded within these, the attacker can extract this information.

**Impact:** Direct exposure of message content or user identifiers.

**Affected Component:** CSS Selectors and Attribute Definitions

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in CSS selectors or attribute values. This requires a fundamental change in how `css-only-chat` encodes information.
*   Use indirect methods for mapping state to content, making direct inspection less revealing.

## Threat: [Cross-User Messaging without Authentication](./threats/cross-user_messaging_without_authentication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the CSS state to inject messages or actions as if they were another user. Since `css-only-chat` inherently lacks a robust authentication mechanism, it's vulnerable to this type of impersonation by manipulating the shared CSS state.

**Impact:** Users could be tricked into believing messages are from someone else, leading to social engineering attacks or misinformation.

**Affected Component:** State Update Mechanisms and User Identification (or lack thereof) within the `css-only-chat` structure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   While challenging with pure CSS, consider integrating a minimal server-side component for message relay or user identification. This would deviate from the core principle of `css-only-chat`.
*   Implement client-side checks (though easily bypassed) to verify the origin of state changes, but this adds complexity to the `css-only-chat` logic.
