# Attack Surface Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Attack Surface: [CSS Complexity Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/css_complexity_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit complex CSS selectors and calculations to overwhelm the browser's rendering engine, causing it to freeze or crash.
*   **How css-only-chat contributes:** The application's core functionality relies *entirely* on CSS for state management and updates, making it inherently vulnerable. Every user interaction triggers CSS re-calculations, and there's no JavaScript fallback to handle excessive load.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a rapid series of messages, each designed to trigger a large number of CSS counter updates or force the evaluation of deeply nested selectors (e.g., using specially crafted usernames that interact with complex attribute selectors).
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service for legitimate users; the chat application becomes completely unusable.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical** (renders the application unusable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **a.**  Implement *strict* rate limiting on *all* user actions that trigger CSS updates (message sending, status changes, etc.). This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   **b.**  Limit the maximum length and complexity of user input (usernames, messages) to prevent crafting overly complex CSS selectors.  Impose hard limits.
        *   **c.**  *Radically* simplify the CSS structure.  Avoid deeply nested selectors, complex attribute selectors (especially with regular expressions), and excessive use of sibling combinators (`+`, `~`).  Prioritize simplicity over features.
        *   **d.**  Monitor server-side for patterns of rapid requests that could indicate a DoS attempt and implement IP-based blocking or throttling.
        *   **e.** Use a CSS preprocessor for minification, but understand this is a minor optimization, not a primary defense.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via CSS State Inspection](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_css_state_inspection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inspect the computed CSS styles or attribute values to infer information about other users or the application's internal state.
*   **How css-only-chat contributes:**  The application's state (online status, message read status, etc.) is *necessarily* encoded within the CSS, making it directly visible to anyone who inspects the DOM using standard browser tools.
*   **Example:**  An attacker uses browser developer tools to inspect the CSS rules applied to a user's element and observes an attribute like `[data-status="online"]` or a class like `.user-online`, revealing their online status.  They can also track changes to these attributes to see when messages are read.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of privacy; attackers can gather information about user activity and potentially use it for social engineering or other malicious purposes.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High** (privacy violation, potential for further attacks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **a.**  *Avoid storing sensitive information directly in easily observable CSS attributes or class names.* This is the core issue.
        *   **b.**  Use obfuscated or indirect representations of state. Instead of `[data-online="true"]`, use a less obvious attribute, a combination of attributes, or a hashed/encoded value that is difficult to interpret without knowing the encoding scheme.
        *   **c.**  *The most effective mitigation is to use JavaScript to manage state and dynamically update the CSS.* This fundamentally changes the architecture but is the only way to truly prevent this type of information disclosure.  Without JavaScript, any state information *must* be reflected in the CSS somehow.

## Attack Surface: [Layout Manipulation and Phishing](./attack_surfaces/layout_manipulation_and_phishing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit CSS rendering quirks or vulnerabilities to alter the visual presentation, creating deceptive interfaces or mimicking legitimate elements.
*   **How css-only-chat contributes:** The complete reliance on CSS for *all* visual aspects, including layout, positioning, and even dynamic updates, makes it highly susceptible to subtle manipulations.  The lack of JavaScript-based validation or control increases the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a browser-specific rendering bug that, when triggered by a specific combination of user inputs (e.g., a long username combined with a particular message), causes elements to overlap unexpectedly.  This could obscure legitimate content or create a fake input field that overlays a real one.
*   **Impact:** Users could be tricked into entering credentials or sensitive information into a fake interface, leading to account compromise or data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for phishing and account compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **a.**  *Extensive* cross-browser testing is paramount. Test on a wide variety of browsers, versions, and operating systems to identify and address rendering inconsistencies.
        *   **b.**  Use a CSS reset or normalize stylesheet to minimize cross-browser differences.
        *   **c.**  Employ *defensive CSS* techniques.  Explicitly set `position`, `z-index`, `width`, `height`, and other layout-related properties to prevent elements from being unintentionally repositioned or overlapped.  Assume the CSS *will* be attacked.
        *   **d.**  *Radically simplify* the CSS layouts and interactions.  Avoid complex or unusual CSS techniques.  The simpler the CSS, the less likely it is to have exploitable quirks.
        *   **e.** *The most robust mitigation is to use JavaScript to manage layout and prevent unexpected CSS manipulations.* This allows for dynamic validation and control that is impossible with pure CSS.
