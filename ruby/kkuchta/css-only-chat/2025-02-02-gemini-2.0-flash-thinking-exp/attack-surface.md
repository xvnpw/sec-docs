# Attack Surface Analysis for kkuchta/css-only-chat

## Attack Surface: [CSS Injection & UI Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/css_injection_&_ui_manipulation.md)

### Description:
Attackers inject malicious CSS code to alter the chat interface, potentially leading to defacement, phishing, or denial of service.
### CSS-Only Chat Contribution:
The application's fundamental reliance on CSS for all UI rendering and interaction makes it inherently vulnerable to CSS injection.  Any user-controlled input that influences CSS generation or selectors becomes a potential injection point. The CSS-driven nature is the *direct* enabler of this attack surface.
### Example:
An attacker crafts a malicious username containing CSS code. When this username is displayed in the chat interface (rendered via CSS), the injected CSS overlays a fake login form, mimicking a legitimate authentication prompt. Unsuspecting users might enter their credentials into this fake form, leading to credential theft (phishing).
### Impact:
Defacement, phishing attacks leading to credential theft, denial of service by rendering the chat unusable or crashing the browser, and potentially limited information disclosure through UI manipulation and social engineering.
### Risk Severity:
**High**
### Mitigation Strategies:
#### Developers:
*   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (CSS Context Aware):**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate *all* user inputs that could influence CSS generation, selectors, or attribute values.  This requires understanding CSS syntax and potential injection vectors within CSS contexts.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded and ideally disallow inline styles altogether. This significantly reduces the impact of CSS injection by preventing execution of externally loaded or attacker-injected stylesheets.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege in CSS Generation:**  Minimize the dynamic generation of CSS based on user input. If dynamic CSS is necessary, carefully control and restrict the parts of CSS that are dynamically generated.
*   **Regular CSS Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits specifically focused on the CSS codebase to identify potential injection points and logic flaws that could be exploited through CSS manipulation.
#### Users:
*   **Utilize Browser Extensions for CSS Control:** Employ browser extensions that offer granular control over CSS execution, allowing users to block inline styles or restrict stylesheet loading from untrusted sources.
*   **Exercise Caution with Suspicious UI Elements:** Be vigilant and avoid interacting with any elements in the chat interface that appear unusual, out of place, or prompt for sensitive information in unexpected ways.
*   **Keep Browsers and Extensions Updated:** Ensure browsers and security-focused browser extensions are kept up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and protections against CSS injection and related vulnerabilities.
