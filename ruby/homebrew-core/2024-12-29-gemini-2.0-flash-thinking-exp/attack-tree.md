## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses Homebrew-core by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Homebrew-core itself.

**Sub-Tree:**

* 0. Compromise Application via Homebrew-core **(CRITICAL NODE)**

                * 1.1.1.1. Phishing Attack on Maintainer **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * 1.1.2. Submit Malicious Pull Request and Bypass Review **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
                * 1.1.2.3. Submit Benign-Looking Code with Malicious Side Effects **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * 1.2. Introduce a Completely Malicious Formula
            * 1.2.1. Typosquatting a Popular Formula Name **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    * 2. Exploit Vulnerability in the Homebrew-core Infrastructure **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * 2.1. Compromise the Homebrew-core Git Repository **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * 2.1.1. Compromise a Homebrew-core Organization Member Account **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * 3. Exploit Homebrew's Installation and Execution Process **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * 3.1. Introduce Malicious Code that Executes During Formula Installation **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * 3.1.1. Leverage `postinstall` or similar hooks **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **0. Compromise Application via Homebrew-core:** This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their goal of compromising the target application through vulnerabilities in Homebrew-core.

* **1. Exploit Vulnerability in a Homebrew-core Formula:** This node signifies the attacker's strategy of targeting individual formulae within the Homebrew-core repository. A vulnerability here could allow for the execution of malicious code on systems installing that formula.

* **1.1. Inject Malicious Code into an Existing Formula:** This is a direct attack vector where an attacker modifies a legitimate formula to include malicious code. This code would then be executed during the installation process of that formula.

* **1.1.1. Compromise a Maintainer's Account:** Gaining control over a Homebrew-core maintainer's account provides the attacker with the permissions necessary to directly modify formulae within the repository. This bypasses the normal pull request and review process.

* **2. Exploit Vulnerability in the Homebrew-core Infrastructure:** This involves targeting the underlying systems and services that support Homebrew-core, such as the Git repository or CDN. Success here could have widespread impact.

* **2.1. Compromise the Homebrew-core Git Repository:**  Gaining control over the official Git repository for Homebrew-core is a critical compromise. It allows the attacker to inject malicious code into any formula, potentially affecting a large number of users.

* **2.1.1. Compromise a Homebrew-core Organization Member Account:** Similar to compromising a maintainer, gaining access to an organization member's account provides elevated privileges within the Homebrew-core infrastructure, including the ability to modify the Git repository.

* **3. Exploit Homebrew's Installation and Execution Process:** This attack vector focuses on the mechanisms Homebrew uses to install and execute software. By exploiting vulnerabilities in this process, an attacker can execute malicious code even if the formula itself appears benign.

* **3.1. Introduce Malicious Code that Executes During Formula Installation:** This involves injecting malicious code that is specifically designed to run during the installation phase of a formula, often leveraging hooks provided by Homebrew.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **1.1.1.1. Phishing Attack on Maintainer:** This path involves socially engineering a Homebrew-core maintainer into revealing their credentials (username and password, or MFA tokens). The likelihood is medium due to the prevalence of phishing attacks, and the impact is high as it grants direct access to modify formulae.

* **1.1.2. Submit Malicious Pull Request and Bypass Review:** This path involves submitting a pull request containing malicious code and successfully evading detection during the code review process. The likelihood is based on the potential for human error or insufficient review processes, and the impact is high as it introduces malicious code into the repository.

* **1.1.2.3. Submit Benign-Looking Code with Malicious Side Effects:** This is a specific tactic within the "Submit Malicious Pull Request" path. The attacker crafts code that appears harmless upon initial inspection but contains hidden malicious functionality that is triggered later or under specific conditions. This increases the difficulty of detection during review, making the likelihood medium and the impact high.

* **1.2.1. Typosquatting a Popular Formula Name:** This path involves creating a new, malicious formula with a name that is very similar to a popular, legitimate formula. Users who misspell the name when trying to install the legitimate formula may inadvertently install the malicious one. The likelihood is medium due to the commonality of typos, and the impact can be medium to high depending on the actions of the malicious formula.

* **3.1.1. Leverage `postinstall` or similar hooks:** This path exploits the `postinstall` scripts (or similar hooks) that are executed after the main installation of a formula. An attacker can inject malicious commands into these scripts, which will then be executed on the user's system with the privileges of the installation process. The likelihood is medium as this is a known and relatively straightforward technique, and the impact is high as it allows for arbitrary code execution.
