# Attack Surface Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Command Execution on Shell Startup](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_command_execution_on_shell_startup.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious commands embedded in dotfiles are automatically executed when a new shell session starts.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Shell configuration files within dotfiles (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) are sourced on shell initialization, executing any commands they contain.
*   **Example:** A dotfile's `.bashrc` includes a line that downloads and executes a backdoor script from a remote server upon opening a terminal.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:**  Thoroughly examine all shell configuration files in dotfiles for any commands before adoption.
    *   **Isolated Testing:** Test dotfiles in a virtual machine before applying them to a production system.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid running dotfile installation scripts with `sudo`.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Dotfiles modify environment variables to alter system or application behavior in a malicious way.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Shell configuration files in dotfiles can set or alter environment variables, potentially redirecting program execution or exposing vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A dotfile's `.zshrc` modifies the `PATH` variable to prioritize a malicious directory, allowing for command hijacking.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, command injection, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Review of PATH Changes:**  Pay close attention to modifications of the `PATH` environment variable in dotfiles.
    *   **Environment Isolation:** Use containers or virtual environments to limit the impact of environment variable changes.
    *   **Regular Auditing:** Monitor environment variables for unexpected changes after dotfile adoption.

## Attack Surface: [Alias and Function Overriding](./attack_surfaces/alias_and_function_overriding.md)

*   **Description:** Dotfiles redefine standard commands with malicious aliases or functions.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Shell configuration files within dotfiles can define aliases and functions that override built-in commands, potentially intercepting and manipulating user actions.
*   **Example:** A dotfile's `.bashrc` defines an alias for `sudo` that logs passwords before executing the actual `sudo` command.
*   **Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Inspect Alias and Function Definitions:** Carefully review all alias and function definitions in dotfiles, especially for security-sensitive commands.
    *   **Command Verification:** Use `which` or `type` to verify the actual command being executed, especially after adopting dotfiles.
    *   **Disable Suspicious Aliases:** Temporarily disable suspicious aliases using `unalias` for testing or critical operations.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Scripts Included in Dotfiles](./attack_surfaces/malicious_scripts_included_in_dotfiles.md)

*   **Description:** Dotfiles repositories contain intentionally malicious scripts disguised as utilities.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Dotfiles repositories may include custom scripts for convenience. Malicious dotfiles can include scripts designed to compromise the system when executed.
*   **Example:** A dotfile repository includes a script named `system_cleanup.sh` that, when executed, installs a backdoor instead of performing cleanup.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Script Review:**  Meticulously examine every script within dotfiles before execution.
    *   **Static Analysis of Scripts:** Use static analysis tools to scan scripts for malicious patterns.
    *   **Sandboxed Script Execution:** Execute scripts in a virtual machine or isolated environment for initial assessment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Scripts Included in Dotfiles](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_scripts_included_in_dotfiles.md)

*   **Description:** Well-intentioned scripts within dotfiles contain exploitable coding vulnerabilities.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Scripts included in dotfiles, even if not malicious in intent, may contain vulnerabilities like command injection or path traversal due to poor coding practices.
*   **Example:** A script in dotfiles that processes filenames without proper sanitization is vulnerable to command injection if a user provides a malicious filename.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, command injection, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review for Vulnerabilities:** Review scripts for common coding vulnerabilities like command injection and path traversal.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Scripts:** Ensure scripts properly sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when writing or reviewing scripts in dotfiles.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised External Scripts or Resources (Supply Chain)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_external_scripts_or_resources__supply_chain_.md)

*   **Description:** Dotfiles download external scripts or resources from compromised sources during installation or runtime.
*   **Dotfiles Contribution:** Dotfile installation scripts or configuration files might fetch scripts or other resources from external URLs. If these external sources are compromised, malicious resources can be introduced.
*   **Example:** A dotfile installation script downloads a bootstrap script from a compromised domain, leading to malware installation during dotfile setup.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify External Source Trustworthiness:**  Thoroughly verify the trustworthiness and integrity of external sources before downloading resources.
    *   **HTTPS and Checksum Verification:** Use HTTPS for downloads and verify checksums of downloaded resources when possible.
    *   **Minimize External Dependencies:** Reduce reliance on external scripts and resources in dotfiles to minimize supply chain risks.
