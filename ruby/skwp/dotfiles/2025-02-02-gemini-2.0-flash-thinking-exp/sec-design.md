# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on managing personal configuration files, often referred to as "dotfiles", using version control. The primary goal is to maintain consistency and portability of a user's preferred operating system and application settings across different environments. For individuals, this enhances personal productivity and customization. For organizations, standardized dotfiles can streamline developer onboarding, ensure consistent development environments, and potentially enforce baseline security configurations.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of exposing sensitive information within dotfiles, such as API keys, passwords, or private keys, if the repository is publicly accessible or improperly secured.
- Risk of misconfiguration or unintended changes introduced through dotfiles, potentially leading to system instability or security vulnerabilities.
- Risk of relying on insecure or outdated configurations if dotfiles are not regularly reviewed and updated.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Version control using Git, providing history and rollback capabilities for configuration changes. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Access control to the GitHub repository, managed by GitHub. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
- security control: Local file system permissions on the user's machine where dotfiles are applied. Implemented in: Operating system.
- accepted risk: Potential exposure of dotfiles in a public repository if the user chooses to make it public.
- accepted risk: Reliance on user's secure coding practices and awareness of security implications when managing dotfiles.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement secrets management practices to avoid storing sensitive information directly in dotfiles. Use tools like password managers, environment variables, or dedicated secrets management solutions.
- security control: Regularly audit dotfiles for sensitive information and potential security misconfigurations.
- security control: Implement input validation and sanitization in any scripts included in dotfiles to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities.
- security control: Consider using a private repository for dotfiles, especially if they contain sensitive configurations or are intended for organizational use.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to dotfiles themselves, but authentication is required to access the Git repository and the systems where dotfiles are applied.
- Authorization: File system permissions on the target systems control who can apply and modify dotfiles. Repository access controls on GitHub manage who can access and modify the dotfiles repository.
- Input validation: Essential for any scripts within dotfiles to prevent malicious code execution or misconfiguration. Validate inputs to configuration scripts and avoid executing untrusted code.
- Cryptography: Use cryptography to protect sensitive data if it must be stored within dotfiles. Consider encryption at rest for sensitive configuration files or using encrypted secrets management solutions.

```

Build Process Description:

The build process for dotfiles is typically manual and developer-driven. It involves the following steps:

1. Developer makes changes to dotfiles locally using a text editor or IDE.
2. Developer uses a Git client to stage, commit, and push changes to the remote dotfiles repository on GitHub.
3. On the target system, the user pulls the latest changes from the dotfiles repository.
4. User executes configuration scripts within the dotfiles to apply the updated configurations to the target system.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Developer workstation security: Ensuring the developer's local machine is secure and free from malware to prevent compromised dotfiles.
- security control: Code review (optional): For organizational use, consider code reviews of dotfile changes to catch potential errors or security issues before they are pushed.
- security control: Git commit signing: Using signed Git commits to verify the authenticity and integrity of changes.
- security control: Repository access control: Restricting write access to the dotfiles repository to authorized developers.
- security control: Static analysis (recommended): Implement static analysis tools to scan configuration scripts for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations before committing changes. This could include linters and security scanners for shell scripts or other configuration languages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Personal productivity and efficiency by maintaining consistent and customized working environments.
- For organizations, standardization of developer environments, potentially impacting onboarding speed and consistency of development practices.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Configuration data: This includes settings for operating systems, applications, and development tools. Sensitivity varies depending on the content. Some configuration data might be considered low sensitivity (e.g., UI themes), while others can be highly sensitive (e.g., API keys, credentials, private keys).
- Scripts: Configuration scripts themselves are code and should be treated with appropriate security considerations. Malicious scripts could compromise the target system.
- Personal preferences: Dotfiles can also contain personal preferences and customizations, which, while not necessarily sensitive in a security context, are valuable to the user.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Is this dotfiles repository intended for personal use or organizational use?
- What type of data is expected to be stored within these dotfiles? Are there any sensitive credentials or secrets?
- What are the target environments where these dotfiles will be applied (personal laptops, servers, specific operating systems)?
- Is there any existing security policy or standard that needs to be considered for managing these dotfiles?
- Is there a need for automated security checks or validation of dotfiles before deployment?

Assumptions:
- The dotfiles repository is primarily for personal use, although the design can be adapted for organizational use.
- Dotfiles are expected to contain a mix of configuration settings and potentially some scripts for automation.
- Target environments are assumed to be Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), but the principles can be applied to other operating systems as well.
- There is no specific existing security policy provided, so general security best practices are assumed.
- Automated security checks are not currently implemented but are recommended as a security enhancement.
