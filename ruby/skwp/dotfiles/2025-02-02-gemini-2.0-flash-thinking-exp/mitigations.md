# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Store Secrets Directly in Dotfiles](./mitigation_strategies/never_store_secrets_directly_in_dotfiles.md)

### Description:
1.  **Audit existing dotfiles:** Review all dotfiles (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, application-specific configuration files) for any hardcoded secrets like API keys, passwords, tokens, database credentials, private keys, etc.
2.  **Remove hardcoded secrets:** Delete all instances of hardcoded secrets directly from the dotfiles.
3.  **Replace with placeholders:** Substitute the removed secrets with placeholders that indicate where the secret should be retrieved from. Common placeholders are designed for environment variables (e.g., `$SECRET_NAME`) or secret management tools.
4.  **Document the change:** Add comments in the dotfiles explaining that secrets are intentionally not stored directly and reference the chosen secret management method (e.g., environment variables, secret vault).
5.  **Educate developers:**  Train developers on the critical security risk of storing secrets in dotfiles and emphasize the importance of using secure secret management practices.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Secret Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive credentials when dotfiles are committed to version control, shared, or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
### Impact:
*   **Secret Exposure:** High reduction. Eliminates the most direct and easily exploitable method of secret exposure through dotfiles.
### Currently Implemented:
Not currently implemented in a project directly adopting `skwp/dotfiles`. The template itself may not explicitly enforce this, and users need to actively implement this practice.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Dotfile repository content: The project's dotfile repository needs to be actively audited and cleaned of any existing hardcoded secrets.
*   Developer workstations: Developers need to be trained and adopt this practice in their local dotfile configurations.
*   Project onboarding documentation:  Documentation should clearly state this policy and guide new developers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Environment Variables for Secrets in Dotfiles](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_environment_variables_for_secrets_in_dotfiles.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify secrets in dotfiles:** Determine which configuration values within dotfiles are sensitive and should be treated as secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords, tokens).
2.  **Define environment variable names:** Choose clear and consistent names for environment variables that will hold these secrets (e.g., `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`).
3.  **Modify dotfiles to reference environment variables:** Update dotfiles to use these environment variables instead of hardcoded values. Use shell syntax like `$VARIABLE_NAME` or `${VARIABLE_NAME}` within dotfiles to access them.
4.  **Document environment variable usage:** Provide clear instructions within the project's documentation on how developers and users should set these environment variables in their environments (development, testing, production).
5.  **Provide examples:** Include example dotfile snippets demonstrating how to correctly reference environment variables for secrets.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Secret Exposure (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of secret exposure by separating secrets from the dotfile repository itself. Secrets are less likely to be accidentally committed to version control.
### Impact:
*   **Secret Exposure:** Medium reduction. While environment variables are a better approach than hardcoding, secrets can still be exposed if environment configurations are not managed securely. However, it's a significant improvement for dotfile security.
### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Developers might be using environment variables for some configurations, but it's likely not a consistently enforced and documented practice when starting with a template like `skwp/dotfiles`.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Standardized environment variable naming: Establish project-wide conventions for naming environment variables that hold secrets to ensure consistency.
*   Enforced usage in dotfiles: Make it a mandatory practice to use environment variables for all secrets referenced in dotfiles.
*   Documentation completeness: Create comprehensive documentation specifically for dotfile configurations and environment variable usage for secrets.
*   Dotfile templates: Update or create dotfile templates that demonstrate and encourage the use of environment variables for secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scan Dotfiles for Secrets Before Committing](./mitigation_strategies/scan_dotfiles_for_secrets_before_committing.md)

### Description:
1.  **Choose a local secret scanning tool:** Select a command-line secret scanning tool that can be run locally (e.g., `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`).
2.  **Integrate as a pre-commit hook:** Configure the chosen secret scanning tool as a Git pre-commit hook for the dotfile repository. This will automatically run the scanner before each commit.
3.  **Configure the scanner:** Configure the secret scanner to specifically scan dotfile file types and content for patterns that resemble secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) using regular expressions and entropy detection.
4.  **Educate developers on usage:** Train developers on how to use the pre-commit hook and how to handle findings from the secret scanner.
5.  **Enforce pre-commit hook usage:** Ensure that all developers have the pre-commit hook installed and active for the dotfile repository.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Secret Exposure (High Severity):** Proactively detects accidentally introduced secrets in dotfiles *before* they are committed to the repository, preventing them from being shared or exposed in version history.
### Impact:
*   **Secret Exposure:** High reduction. Provides an immediate, local safety net to prevent accidental secret commits directly from developer workstations.
### Currently Implemented:
Not currently implemented in a project starting with `skwp/dotfiles`. This is a proactive security measure that needs to be intentionally added to the development workflow.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Pre-commit hook setup: Configure and distribute the secret scanning pre-commit hook for the dotfile repository.
*   Tool configuration for dotfiles: Configure the chosen secret scanning tool to effectively scan dotfile content.
*   Developer training: Train developers on how to install, use, and respond to the pre-commit hook.
*   Enforcement mechanism: Establish a process to ensure all developers are using the pre-commit hook (e.g., through documentation, scripts, or repository settings).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thorough Code Review of Dotfile Changes](./mitigation_strategies/thorough_code_review_of_dotfile_changes.md)

### Description:
1.  **Include dotfiles in code review:**  Explicitly include all changes to dotfiles in the standard code review process for the project.
2.  **Train reviewers on dotfile security:** Educate code reviewers on the specific security risks associated with dotfiles, focusing on malicious code injection and secret exposure within configuration files.
3.  **Focus review on security aspects:** During dotfile code reviews, reviewers should specifically examine:
    *   Presence of hardcoded secrets.
    *   Potentially malicious or unnecessary scripts or commands.
    *   Obfuscated or unclear code within dotfiles.
    *   External dependencies or scripts sourced from untrusted URLs within dotfiles.
    *   Overly permissive or insecure configurations defined in dotfiles.
4.  **Mandatory reviews for dotfile changes:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for *all* modifications to dotfiles before they are merged into the main branch or deployed to any environment.
5.  **Utilize static analysis tools as aid:** Integrate static analysis tools like `ShellCheck` into the code review process to automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding errors in shell scripts within dotfiles *before* manual review.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malicious Code Injection (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of introducing malicious code through dotfiles by manual inspection during code review.
*   **Secret Exposure (Medium Severity):** Helps to catch accidentally committed secrets during the code review process by human reviewers.
*   **Configuration Drift (Low Severity):** Ensures that changes to dotfiles are reviewed and understood, reducing the risk of unintended or insecure configuration changes.
### Impact:
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** Medium reduction. Human review is effective but not foolproof and can be time-consuming.
*   **Secret Exposure:** Medium reduction. Human review can miss secrets, especially if they are subtly introduced or obfuscated.
*   **Configuration Drift:** Low reduction. Primarily focuses on security aspects, less directly on general configuration drift management.
### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. General code review processes might be in place, but it's unlikely that dotfiles are specifically targeted for rigorous security-focused reviews when starting with a general template like `skwp/dotfiles`.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Formal dotfile code review process:  Establish a documented and enforced code review process *specifically* for dotfiles, highlighting security considerations.
*   Security-focused reviewer training: Provide training to code reviewers on dotfile-specific security vulnerabilities and best practices.
*   Integration with static analysis for review: Integrate static analysis tools into the dotfile code review workflow to automate initial checks.
*   Enforcement of mandatory reviews for dotfiles: Ensure that all dotfile changes are subject to mandatory code review before integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Dotfiles from a Vetted Internal Repository](./mitigation_strategies/source_dotfiles_from_a_vetted_internal_repository.md)

### Description:
1.  **Create an internal dotfile repository:** Establish a dedicated, internal repository to host approved and vetted dotfiles for the project or organization.
2.  **Vet and curate dotfiles:** Populate this internal repository with dotfiles that have been thoroughly reviewed for security and best practices.  Initially, this might involve adapting and securing dotfiles from sources like `skwp/dotfiles`, but with a strong focus on security hardening.
3.  **Restrict external dotfile usage:** Discourage or strictly prohibit the direct use of dotfiles from public, external repositories (like directly cloning `skwp/dotfiles` into production or shared environments).
4.  **Promote internal repository usage:** Make the internal dotfile repository the primary and recommended source for developers and systems to obtain dotfile configurations.
5.  **Regularly update and maintain internal dotfiles:** Implement a process to regularly update and maintain the internal dotfile repository, incorporating security patches, best practices, and addressing any newly identified vulnerabilities.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malicious Code Injection (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the risk of introducing malicious code by controlling the source of dotfiles to a trusted, internally managed repository.
*   **Configuration Drift (Medium Severity):** Promotes consistency and reduces the risk of configuration drift by centralizing dotfile management and providing a single source of truth.
### Impact:
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** High reduction. Proactively prevents the introduction of malicious code from untrusted external sources.
*   **Configuration Drift:** Medium reduction. Centralization helps with consistency, but requires ongoing maintenance and version control within the internal repository.
### Currently Implemented:
Not currently implemented when starting with a public repository like `skwp/dotfiles`. The initial approach is likely to be more ad-hoc and less centrally managed.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Creation of internal dotfile repository:  The primary missing step is the creation and population of a secure, internal repository for vetted dotfiles.
*   Vetting and curation process: Define a clear process for vetting, curating, and updating dotfiles within the internal repository.
*   Policy on external dotfile sources: Establish a clear policy that restricts or discourages the use of external, unvetted dotfile sources.
*   Developer adoption and migration:  Plan and execute a migration strategy for developers and systems to transition to using the internal dotfile repository.
