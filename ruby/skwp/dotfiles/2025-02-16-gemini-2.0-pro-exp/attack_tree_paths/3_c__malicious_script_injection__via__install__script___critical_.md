Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.c - Malicious Script Injection (via `install` script)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vector described in path 3.c of the attack tree:  Malicious Script Injection via the `install` script within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.  We aim to understand the preconditions, execution steps, potential impacts, mitigation strategies, and detection methods associated with this specific attack.  This analysis will inform recommendations for improving the security posture of the dotfiles and the processes surrounding their use.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where the `install` script (or any script executed during the installation process) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository is maliciously modified.  It assumes that this modification is a direct result of a prior compromise of the `skwp` GitHub account (as indicated by the dependency on attack paths 1.a or 1.c).  We will consider:

*   The types of malicious code that could be injected.
*   The potential targets and impacts of such code.
*   The technical mechanisms involved in the attack.
*   Methods for preventing and detecting this type of attack.
*   The user actions that trigger the execution of the malicious script.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks that do not involve modification of the `install` script (e.g., social engineering attacks that trick users into running a *different* malicious script).
*   Vulnerabilities within the dotfiles themselves that are *not* related to malicious script injection (e.g., misconfigurations that are exploited *after* a successful, non-malicious installation).
*   Compromise of the user's machine *before* they attempt to install the dotfiles.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to categorize the potential threats posed by a compromised `install` script.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  While we cannot directly review the *compromised* script (as it doesn't exist yet), we will analyze the *legitimate* `install` script (and related scripts) from the `skwp/dotfiles` repository to identify potential injection points and areas of concern.  We will hypothesize how an attacker might modify these scripts.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of successful script execution, considering different levels of user privilege and system configurations.
4.  **Mitigation and Detection Analysis:** We will explore various preventative and detective controls that could reduce the likelihood or impact of this attack.
5.  **Documentation:**  The findings will be documented in this report, including recommendations for improvement.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.c

### 4.1. Preconditions

The primary precondition for this attack is the successful compromise of the `skwp` GitHub account (attack paths 1.a or 1.c).  This could occur through:

*   **1.a. GitHub Account Compromise (Direct):**  Password compromise (phishing, credential stuffing, weak password), session hijacking, or compromise of a connected third-party application with GitHub access.
*   **1.c. Compromise of GitHub Credentials via Compromised Development Machine:**  Malware on `skwp`'s development machine that steals GitHub credentials or session tokens.

Without this precondition, the attacker cannot directly modify the `install` script in the official repository.

### 4.2. Execution Steps

1.  **Account Compromise:** The attacker gains control of the `skwp` GitHub account.
2.  **Script Modification:** The attacker modifies the `install` script (or a script called by `install`) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.  This modification involves injecting malicious code.  The code could be:
    *   **Directly embedded:**  Shell commands, Python code, etc., directly inserted into the script.
    *   **Obfuscated:**  Encoded or otherwise disguised to make detection more difficult.
    *   **Downloaded from a remote source:**  The script could be modified to download and execute a payload from an attacker-controlled server.  This allows the attacker to change the payload without further modifying the `install` script.
    *   **Conditional:** The malicious code might only execute under certain conditions (e.g., on a specific operating system, date, or if a particular file exists).
3.  **User Action:** An unsuspecting user downloads and runs the compromised `install` script.  This typically occurs when the user is setting up a new machine or updating their existing dotfiles.  The user might clone the repository directly or follow instructions on a website or blog post that references the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
4.  **Malicious Code Execution:** The injected code executes on the user's machine, with the privileges of the user running the script.
5.  **Post-Exploitation:** The attacker achieves their objective, which could range from data exfiltration to establishing persistence on the compromised machine.

### 4.3. Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

| Threat Category        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spoofing**           | The compromised `install` script impersonates the legitimate script.  The user believes they are running a trusted script from `skwp`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Tampering**          | The `install` script has been tampered with; its integrity is compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Repudiation**        | If the attack is subtle, it might be difficult to prove that the `skwp/dotfiles` repository was the source of the compromise.  The attacker might try to cover their tracks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Information Disclosure** | The malicious code could steal sensitive information from the user's machine, such as SSH keys, API tokens, browser cookies, or personal files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Denial of Service**   | The malicious code could delete files, corrupt the system, or otherwise render the machine unusable.  It could also consume system resources, making it slow or unresponsive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | If the user runs the `install` script with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`), the malicious code could gain full control of the system.  Even without elevated privileges, the code could exploit vulnerabilities in the user's environment to gain higher privileges.                                                                                                                   |

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of this attack is rated as **Very High** because:

*   **Data Loss/Theft:**  Sensitive data could be stolen or destroyed.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker could gain complete control of the user's machine.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Both `skwp` and users who distribute the compromised dotfiles could suffer reputational damage.
*   **Financial Loss:**  If the compromised machine is used for financial transactions or stores financial data, the user could suffer financial loss.
*   **Legal Consequences:**  Depending on the nature of the stolen data and the attacker's actions, there could be legal consequences for the user or `skwp`.
* **Lateral Movement:** The compromised machine can be used as beach head to attack other machines in the network.

### 4.5. Mitigation and Detection Analysis

#### 4.5.1. Preventative Measures

*   **Strong Account Security (for `skwp`):**
    *   **Strong, Unique Password:**  Use a password manager to generate and store a long, complex, and unique password for the GitHub account.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enable 2FA on the GitHub account, preferably using a hardware security key or TOTP app.  SMS-based 2FA is less secure.
    *   **Regular Password Audits:**  Periodically review and update the password.
    *   **Monitor Account Activity:**  Regularly check GitHub's security logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Limit Third-Party Access:**  Carefully review and restrict the permissions granted to third-party applications connected to the GitHub account.
*   **Secure Development Practices (for `skwp`):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the development machine used to manage the dotfiles has only the necessary privileges.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep the operating system, software, and security tools on the development machine up-to-date.
    *   **Malware Protection:**  Use reputable anti-malware software and keep it updated.
    *   **Code Signing:**  Digitally sign the `install` script (and other scripts) to ensure their integrity.  This would require users to verify the signature before running the script. This is a strong mitigation, but adds complexity to the installation process.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools to scan the dotfiles for potential vulnerabilities before committing changes.
*   **User Education (for users):**
    *   **Verify the Source:**  Instruct users to download the dotfiles only from the official `skwp/dotfiles` repository on GitHub.
    *   **Check for Recent Commits:**  Before running the `install` script, users should check the commit history to see if there have been any recent, unexpected changes.  This is not foolproof, but it can help detect obvious tampering.
    *   **Run with Least Privilege:**  Encourage users to run the `install` script *without* elevated privileges (i.e., not using `sudo`) unless absolutely necessary.  This limits the potential damage if the script is compromised.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Advanced users could consider running the `install` script in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a virtual machine or container) to isolate it from their main system.
* **Repository Protections:**
    * **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforce branch protection rules on the `main` or `master` branch to require pull request reviews before merging changes. This prevents direct commits to the main branch, forcing a review process.
    * **Require Signed Commits:** GitHub allows requiring signed commits, which helps ensure that commits are from trusted sources. This adds another layer of verification.
    * **Code Owners:** Define code owners for the repository to ensure that specific individuals or teams are responsible for reviewing changes to critical files like the `install` script.

#### 4.5.2. Detective Measures

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool to monitor the `install` script (and other critical files) for changes.  This can help detect unauthorized modifications.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  An IDS can monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of malicious behavior.  This could help detect the execution of malicious code injected into the `install` script.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Regularly review system logs (e.g., shell history, authentication logs) for suspicious activity.
*   **GitHub Security Alerts:**  Enable GitHub's security alerts to receive notifications about potential vulnerabilities in the repository's dependencies. While this doesn't directly detect a compromised `install` script, it can help identify other security issues.
* **User Reporting:** Encourage users to report any suspicious behavior or unexpected results after running the `install` script.

### 4.6. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Account Security:**  The most critical recommendation is to strengthen the security of the `skwp` GitHub account.  This is the foundation for preventing this attack.  Implement all the account security measures listed above.
2.  **Implement Code Signing:**  Digitally sign the `install` script and provide instructions for users to verify the signature. This is the most robust technical control against script tampering.
3.  **Enforce Branch Protection Rules:**  Require pull request reviews and signed commits for all changes to the `main` branch.
4.  **Educate Users:**  Provide clear and concise instructions to users on how to safely download and run the dotfiles, emphasizing the importance of verifying the source and running with least privilege.
5.  **Consider Sandboxing:**  For advanced users, provide guidance on how to run the `install` script in a sandboxed environment.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the dotfiles and the development environment.
7.  **Implement File Integrity Monitoring:** Deploy FIM to detect unauthorized changes to critical files.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack path 3.c, Malicious Script Injection via the `install` script, represents a significant threat to users of the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.  The attack's very low likelihood is entirely dependent on the compromise of the `skwp` GitHub account, making account security paramount.  However, the very high impact of a successful attack necessitates a multi-layered approach to mitigation, combining strong preventative measures with robust detection capabilities.  By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the risk associated with this attack vector can be significantly reduced.
