# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secrets Management (Dotfiles-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secrets_management__dotfiles-specific_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Secrets Management (Dotfiles-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets within Dotfiles:** Thoroughly examine all files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository and any personal customizations. List any strings that are API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.
    2.  **Choose a Retrieval Method:** Select how secrets will be *accessed* by the dotfiles. This is *not* about storage, but about how the scripts and configurations will get the values. Options, in order of increasing security and complexity:
        *   **Environment Variables (Least Secure, but Dotfiles-Compatible):**  Set environment variables *outside* the dotfiles (e.g., in a separate `.secrets` file that is *not* committed, or using a system-level mechanism). Then, *reference* these variables within the dotfiles. Example: `export MY_API_KEY=$MY_API_KEY_VALUE` (where `MY_API_KEY_VALUE` is set elsewhere).
        *   **`pass` Integration (More Secure):** Use the `pass` command-line password manager. Store secrets using `pass`, and then retrieve them within the dotfiles using `pass show secret-name`. Example: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(pass show github/api-key)`.
        *   **Secrets Manager CLI Integration (Most Secure):** Use the command-line interface (CLI) of a dedicated secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.). Retrieve secrets using the appropriate CLI commands. Example (AWS): `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value ...)`
    3.  **Modify Dotfiles to Use Retrieval Method:** Replace all hardcoded secrets within the dotfiles with the chosen retrieval method.  Ensure that every place a secret was previously used now uses the appropriate command or variable reference.
    4.  **Test Retrieval within Dotfiles Context:** After modifying the dotfiles, source them (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc`) and verify that the environment variables or commands correctly retrieve the secrets. Use `echo $VARIABLE_NAME` or similar commands to check.
    5.  **Remove Hardcoded Secrets:** Once retrieval is confirmed, *completely remove* all hardcoded secrets from the dotfiles. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove them from the Git history as well.
    6.  **`.gitignore` for Secret Files:** Add entries to the `.gitignore` file at the root of the dotfiles repository to prevent accidental commits of files that might contain secrets (e.g., `*.key`, `*.pem`, `secrets.txt`, `credentials.json`, `.env`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (within Dotfiles):** (Severity: **Critical**) Prevents secrets from being exposed if the dotfiles repository is made public or compromised.
    *   **Credential Theft (from Dotfiles):** (Severity: **Critical**) Makes it impossible to steal credentials directly from the dotfiles.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (assuming the chosen retrieval method is secure).
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (secrets are no longer present in the dotfiles).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `skwp/dotfiles` uses environment variables in some places, suggesting an awareness of the issue, but it's not consistent or comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of a single, well-defined secrets retrieval method across all dotfiles.
    *   Clear examples and guidance on integrating with `pass` or secrets manager CLIs.
    *   Automated checks to prevent committing secrets (e.g., pre-commit hooks).


## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Pull Requests (for Dotfiles Management)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_pull_requests__for_dotfiles_management_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Code Review and Pull Requests (for Dotfiles Management)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a personal fork of the `skwp/dotfiles` repository on GitHub (or your chosen Git hosting service).
    2.  **Branching for Changes:** *Always* create a new branch from your `main` (or `master`) branch for *any* modification to your dotfiles. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `add-vim-plugin`, `fix-zsh-alias`).
    3.  **Make Changes on the Branch:** Modify the dotfiles *only* on the feature branch.
    4.  **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes to the feature branch and push it to your forked repository.
    5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your feature branch to your `main` branch.
    6.  **Review the Diff:** *Carefully* review the changes in the pull request's diff view. Examine all added, modified, and deleted lines, paying particular attention to shell scripts and configuration files.
    7.  **Merge (or Request Changes):** If the review is satisfactory, merge the pull request. If issues are found, make further changes on the branch and update the pull request.
    8.  **Apply Changes Locally:** After merging, pull the changes from your `main` branch to your local system and apply them (e.g., by sourcing the relevant files or restarting your shell).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (into Dotfiles):** (Severity: **High**) Reduces the risk of unknowingly applying malicious code from the upstream repository or from your own mistakes.
    *   **Accidental Errors (in Dotfiles):** (Severity: **Medium**) The review process helps catch errors and misconfigurations before they are applied.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium** (requires diligent review).
    *   **Accidental Errors:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented by default for individual users. The `skwp/dotfiles` repository itself uses pull requests, but this is not enforced for users' personal forks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No guidance or encouragement for users to adopt this workflow.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `curl | sh` and Pin Dependencies (within Dotfiles)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__curl__sh__and_pin_dependencies__within_dotfiles_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Avoid `curl | sh` and Pin Dependencies (within Dotfiles)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `curl | sh`:** Search all files within your dotfiles for instances of `curl | sh` or `wget -O - ... | sh`.
    2.  **Manual Download and Inspection:** Replace these patterns with a two-step process:
        *   Download the script: `curl https://example.com/install.sh -o install.sh`
        *   Inspect the script: Open `install.sh` in a text editor and *carefully* review its contents.
        *   Execute locally: `sh install.sh` (only after inspection).
    3.  **Pin Package Manager Dependencies:** Within your dotfiles, where package managers are used (e.g., in installation scripts), specify *exact* versions.  Instead of `brew install node`, use `brew install node@16`.  This applies to `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, `npm`, etc.
    4.  **Vendor Small Dependencies (Optional):** If a script or tool is small, self-contained, and its license allows, consider including it *directly* within your dotfiles repository. This eliminates the need for external downloads.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (via External Scripts):** (Severity: **High**) Prevents direct execution of potentially malicious code downloaded from the internet.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (via Package Managers):** (Severity: **High**) Pinning versions reduces the risk of installing compromised packages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (requires manual inspection).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium** (pinning helps, but doesn't eliminate all risks).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `skwp/dotfiles` uses `curl | sh` in some places, which is a major concern. Package manager usage is present, but version pinning is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Widespread use of `curl | sh` without alternatives.
    *   Inconsistent version pinning.
    *   No vendoring of dependencies.
