```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise skwp's GitHub Account [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_skwp's_github_account__critical_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical attack vector. Gaining control of the `skwp/dotfiles` repository allows an attacker to directly modify the code and distribute malicious updates to anyone using the dotfiles.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Phishing/Social Engineering skwp](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__phishingsocial_engineering_skwp.md)

*   **Description:**  Targeting the repository owner (`skwp`) with deceptive emails, messages, or other communication methods designed to trick them into revealing their GitHub credentials or installing malware.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.c. Compromise skwp's Machine (Malware, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/1_c__compromise_skwp's_machine__malware__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining access to `skwp`'s computer through malware, physical access, or other means. This allows the attacker to directly push malicious code to the repository or steal credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfigured Dotfiles Settings](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfigured_dotfiles_settings.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.a. Exposed Secrets (API Keys, etc.) in plain text [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a__exposed_secrets__api_keys__etc___in_plain_text__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Users of the dotfiles may inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, private keys) directly within their dotfiles, either in configuration files or in their shell history. If these dotfiles are publicly accessible (e.g., on a public GitHub repository), the secrets are exposed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Included Tools/Scripts with Security Implications](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_included_toolsscripts_with_security_implications.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.c. Malicious Script Injection (via `install` script) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_c__malicious_script_injection__via__install__script___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `install` script (or any other script within the dotfiles) is modified to include malicious code.  This is most likely to occur if the attacker has compromised `skwp`'s GitHub account (1.a or 1.c). When a user runs the compromised `install` script, the malicious code is executed on their system.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (directly dependent on the success of 1.a or 1.c)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if `skwp`'s account is compromised; otherwise, very high)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (if modifying the script directly; Novice if simply running the compromised script)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
