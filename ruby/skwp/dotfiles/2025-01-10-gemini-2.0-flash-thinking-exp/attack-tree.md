# Attack Tree Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

Objective: Achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's environment by exploiting weaknesses in how the application utilizes dotfiles from the skwp/dotfiles repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using skwp/dotfiles (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_skwpdotfiles__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means they have gained control over the application's execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Shell Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_shell_configuration__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) because these scripts are executed whenever a new shell is started. This provides a persistent mechanism for executing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into .bashrc/.zshrc (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into__bashrc_zshrc__critical_node_.md)

Gaining the ability to modify these files is a critical step, allowing the attacker to inject their malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Function (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_function__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers insert malicious shell functions into the configuration files. These functions can be designed to execute arbitrary commands when called, either explicitly by the application or implicitly through other shell operations. The risk is high because functions can be named subtly to avoid easy detection and can perform complex actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Environment Variable (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_environment_variable__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers set environment variables that are known to trigger code execution when a shell is initialized. A classic example is `PROMPT_COMMAND`, which executes a command just before displaying the shell prompt. If the application spawns shells, this can be a reliable way to execute code. The risk is high because environment variables are often implicitly trusted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Execution During Dotfile Sourcing (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_execution_during_dotfile_sourcing__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category of attacks exploits vulnerabilities in how the application loads and executes the dotfiles. If done improperly, it can lead to direct code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsafe Sourcing Practices (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsafe_sourcing_practices__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the underlying security flaw in how dotfiles are handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Source Untrusted Dotfiles Directly (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/source_untrusted_dotfiles_directly__high-risk_path_.md)

The application directly sources dotfiles from locations that are not controlled by the application or are potentially under the attacker's control (e.g., user-provided paths). This is a high-risk path because it gives the attacker direct control over the executed code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Source Dotfiles with Elevated Privileges (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/source_dotfiles_with_elevated_privileges__high-risk_path_.md)

The application sources dotfiles while running with elevated privileges (e.g., as root). Any malicious code within these dotfiles will also execute with those elevated privileges, leading to a complete system compromise. This is a high-risk path due to the potential for immediate privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Source Dotfiles Without Input Validation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/source_dotfiles_without_input_validation__high-risk_path_.md)

The application constructs the path to the dotfiles based on user-provided input without proper validation. This allows attackers to use techniques like path traversal to force the application to source arbitrary files, including malicious ones located outside the intended directories. This is a high-risk path because input validation flaws are common and relatively easy to exploit.
