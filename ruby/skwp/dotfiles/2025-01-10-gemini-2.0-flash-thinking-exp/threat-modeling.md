# Threat Model Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_configuration_files.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could compromise the `skwp/dotfiles` repository (or a malicious fork that users are unknowingly using as a direct replacement) and inject malicious shell scripts or commands within configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`). When a user applies these dotfiles from the compromised repository, the malicious code could execute automatically upon opening a terminal, starting a new shell session, or launching the configured application.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's account and potentially the local machine. The attacker could steal data, install malware, or use the compromised machine as a stepping stone for further attacks.
    * **Affected Component:** Individual configuration files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `.gitconfig`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify the Official Repository:**  Always ensure you are directly using the official `skwp/dotfiles` repository or a trusted and actively maintained fork that you have thoroughly vetted. Be extremely cautious of using forks without careful inspection.
        * **Monitor Repository Activity:** Keep an eye on the commit history and activity of the `skwp/dotfiles` repository for any suspicious or unexpected changes.
        * **Code Review Before Applying:**  Carefully review any changes made to the dotfiles within the repository before applying them to your system. Understand what each line of code does.
        * **Regular Updates with Caution:** While keeping dotfiles updated is generally good practice, be cautious about blindly applying updates from a potentially compromised repository. Review changes before updating.
        * **Use Static Analysis Tools:** Employ tools that can scan shell scripts and configuration files for potential security vulnerabilities within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files within the Repository](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files_within_the_repository.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gaining unauthorized write access to the `skwp/dotfiles` repository could intentionally introduce sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, database credentials, or internal service URLs into the configuration files. Users who then adopt these dotfiles from the compromised repository would inadvertently expose themselves to risk.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive accounts, services, or data for users adopting the compromised dotfiles. This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository that might be modified to contain sensitive data (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` if environment variables are misused, `.gitconfig` if credentials are added).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Repository Access Controls:** Ensure the `skwp/dotfiles` repository (or any trusted fork) has strong access controls and that only authorized individuals have write permissions.
        * **Regular Security Audits of the Repository:** Periodically audit the content of the `skwp/dotfiles` repository for any inadvertently or maliciously added sensitive information.
        * **Automated Secret Scanning:** Implement automated tools that scan the repository for potential secrets and alert maintainers to any findings.
        * **Educate Contributors:** If contributing to the repository, educate contributors on the risks of including sensitive information and best practices for avoiding it.

## Threat: [Malicious Aliases and Functions Introduced in the Repository](./threats/malicious_aliases_and_functions_introduced_in_the_repository.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromising the `skwp/dotfiles` repository could introduce malicious aliases or functions within shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). Users adopting these dotfiles would then have these malicious aliases or functions active in their shell, potentially leading to background execution of harmful commands.
    * **Impact:** Subtle compromise of user activity, potential data theft, and unauthorized command execution without the user's explicit knowledge for users adopting the compromised dotfiles.
    * **Affected Component:** Shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Community Review and Scrutiny:** Rely on the community aspect of open-source to review and scrutinize changes made to the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
        * **Careful Examination of Shell Configurations:** When adopting or updating dotfiles from the repository, carefully examine all aliases and functions defined in the shell configuration files.
        * **Report Suspicious Activity:** Encourage users to report any suspicious or unexpected behavior they observe after adopting dotfiles from the repository.
        * **Maintainers Vigilance:**  Repository maintainers should be vigilant in reviewing and vetting contributions to prevent the introduction of malicious code.

## Threat: [Exploiting Auto-Loading Mechanisms in Editor/Tool Configurations within the Repository](./threats/exploiting_auto-loading_mechanisms_in_editortool_configurations_within_the_repository.md)

* **Description:** Configuration files for editors like Vim (`.vimrc`) or tools like tmux (`.tmux.conf`) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository could be modified by an attacker to include commands that are executed automatically upon startup. Users adopting these configurations would then unknowingly execute the attacker's commands.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the user's session when using the affected application, potentially leading to data theft or further system compromise for users adopting the compromised configurations.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files for specific applications within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository (e.g., `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Review Editor/Tool Configurations from the Repository:** Carefully inspect the configuration files for editors and tools within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository, paying close attention to any commands that are executed automatically.
        * **Be Cautious of Auto-Loaded Plugins/Features:** Be wary of configurations that automatically load plugins or features from untrusted sources.
        * **Isolate or Sandbox Applications:** Where possible, consider running applications like Vim or tmux in isolated or sandboxed environments to limit the impact of potentially malicious configurations.
        * **Maintainer Scrutiny of Contributions:** Repository maintainers should carefully review contributions that modify editor or tool configurations, paying close attention to auto-loading mechanisms.
