# Attack Surface Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Attack Surface: [Repository Compromise (Upstream)](./attack_surfaces/repository_compromise__upstream_.md)

**Description:** The upstream `skwp/dotfiles` repository on GitHub is compromised, leading to the introduction of malicious code or configurations.

**How Dotfiles Contributes:** Developers directly clone or pull updates from this repository, inheriting any malicious changes.

**Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the `skwp/dotfiles` repository and modifies the `.bashrc` file to execute a script that steals SSH keys upon a developer's next login.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of developer machines, potential access to internal systems and resources through stolen credentials or backdoors.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly verify the integrity of the upstream repository (e.g., check commit signatures if available).
* Consider forking the repository and auditing changes before merging.
* Implement automated checks for suspicious code changes in the dotfiles.
* Educate developers about the risks of using external dotfile repositories.

## Attack Surface: [Local Execution of Malicious Scripts](./attack_surfaces/local_execution_of_malicious_scripts.md)

**Description:** Dotfiles contain scripts (e.g., in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`) that are automatically executed upon shell startup or application launch, and these scripts are malicious.

**How Dotfiles Contributes:** Dotfiles are designed to be sourced and executed, making them a prime target for embedding malicious code that will run automatically.

**Example:** A compromised `.zshrc` file contains a function that, upon shell initialization, downloads and executes a remote script containing ransomware.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or propagation of malware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review all scripts within the dotfiles before using them.
* Implement static analysis tools to scan dotfiles for potentially malicious patterns.
* Restrict execution permissions on dotfile scripts where possible.
* Regularly audit the contents of dotfiles for unexpected changes.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Secrets Exposure](./attack_surfaces/accidental_secrets_exposure.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or private keys are inadvertently stored directly within the dotfiles.

**How Dotfiles Contributes:** Developers might mistakenly include credentials in configuration files within their dotfiles. If these dotfiles are shared or committed to a repository, these secrets become exposed.

**Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key for a cloud service within their `.bash_aliases` file for convenience. This key is then exposed if the dotfiles are pushed to a public or even a shared private repository.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive services and data, potential for data breaches and financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never store secrets directly in dotfiles.
* Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Doppler) to manage sensitive information.
* Implement linters or pre-commit hooks to prevent committing files containing secrets.
* Regularly scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Path Manipulation Leading to Trojaned Binaries](./attack_surfaces/path_manipulation_leading_to_trojaned_binaries.md)

**Description:** Dotfiles modify the `$PATH` environment variable in a way that prioritizes a directory containing malicious executables over legitimate system commands.

**How Dotfiles Contributes:** Dotfiles often customize the `$PATH` to include personal bin directories or tool locations. A malicious actor could manipulate this to inject a path pointing to their malicious binaries.

**Example:** A compromised `.zshrc` adds a directory `/tmp/evil_bin` to the beginning of the `$PATH`. This directory contains a malicious executable named `sudo`. When the developer types `sudo`, the malicious version is executed instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potential for complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review any modifications to the `$PATH` variable within the dotfiles.
* Avoid adding untrusted or unnecessary directories to the `$PATH`.
* Implement checks to verify the integrity of executables in the `$PATH`.
