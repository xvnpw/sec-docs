# Threat Model Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Shell Configuration](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_shell_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage the structure and common shell configuration files (like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` present in `skwp/dotfiles`) to inject malicious shell commands. If a user adopts these dotfiles and an application spawns a shell or executes commands in that environment, the injected code will run with the user's privileges. This is a direct consequence of using and executing scripts within the `skwp/dotfiles` structure.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, potentially leading to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.

**Which https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles component is affected:** Primarily affects the shell configuration files within the `shell` directory (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`) and any scripts sourced by them.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Developers should avoid executing shell commands based on user-controlled configurations whenever possible.
* If shell execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to prevent command injection.
* Users should carefully review the shell configuration files from `skwp/dotfiles` before applying them, looking for any unexpected or suspicious code.
* Users should be cautious about directly using the `skwp/dotfiles` without understanding the implications of the included scripts.
* Consider using tools that perform static analysis on the shell scripts within `skwp/dotfiles` to detect potential malicious code.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** The `skwp/dotfiles` repository, like many dotfiles collections, might contain configuration files (e.g., within the `git` or `editor` directories) that could inadvertently store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or other secrets. If a user adopts these dotfiles and an application reads these configurations, it could expose this sensitive data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or compromise of other systems that rely on the exposed credentials.

**Which https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles component is affected:** Various configuration files across different directories within `skwp/dotfiles`, including but not limited to `.gitconfig` in the `git` directory, editor configurations in `editor`, and potentially custom configuration files within other modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Developers should educate users on the risks of storing secrets in dotfiles, even within well-known repositories like `skwp/dotfiles`.
* Encourage users to use secure secret management solutions instead of relying on configurations within `skwp/dotfiles` for sensitive information.
* Users should carefully audit the configuration files from `skwp/dotfiles` before applying them, removing any sensitive information.
* Consider using tools like `git-secrets` to prevent committing secrets if forking or modifying the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via Configuration](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_via_configuration.md)

**Description:** Configuration files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository might specify file paths or include other files. If an application using these dotfiles doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths, an attacker could potentially craft malicious configurations (either by modifying their local copy or through a compromised fork) to access files outside the intended dotfiles directory when the application processes these configurations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the user's system, potentially leading to data breaches or privilege escalation if executable files are targeted.

**Which https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles component is affected:** Any component within `skwp/dotfiles` that defines or uses file paths, such as scripts in the `bin` directory or configuration files in various modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Developers should implement strict validation and sanitization of all file paths read from dotfile configurations originating from `skwp/dotfiles`.
* Use absolute paths or restrict path resolution to a specific allowed directory when processing configurations from `skwp/dotfiles`.
* Users should be cautious about modifying file paths within their local copy of `skwp/dotfiles` without understanding the security implications.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Configuration Values](./threats/command_injection_via_configuration_values.md)

**Description:** Configuration values within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository could potentially be crafted to include malicious commands. If an application uses these values as arguments to system commands or shell scripts without proper sanitization, and a user adopts these dotfiles, the injected commands will be executed.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges.

**Which https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles component is affected:** Any scripts or configuration files within `skwp/dotfiles` that define values that might be used as arguments to external commands, potentially found in the `bin` directory or custom scripts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Developers should avoid constructing shell commands by concatenating strings from dotfile configurations originating from `skwp/dotfiles`.
* Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives for executing external processes when dealing with values from `skwp/dotfiles`.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any configuration values from `skwp/dotfiles` that might be used in command execution.
