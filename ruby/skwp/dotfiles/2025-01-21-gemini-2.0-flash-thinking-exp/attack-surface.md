# Attack Surface Analysis for skwp/dotfiles

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Shell Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_shell_configuration.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious commands or scripts into shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

**How Dotfiles Contribute to the Attack Surface:** Dotfiles are the primary mechanism for customizing shell environments. If compromised, they can be used to automatically execute malicious code upon shell startup or when specific commands are used.

**Example:** An attacker injects an alias `ls='rm -rf /'` into `.bashrc`. When the user types `ls`, the system will attempt to delete all files.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data loss, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Manually review dotfiles content:** Carefully inspect all shell configuration files for unfamiliar or suspicious commands and aliases.
* **Use version control for dotfiles:** Track changes to dotfiles to identify unauthorized modifications.
* **Implement code signing or integrity checks:**  For more advanced setups, cryptographically sign dotfiles to ensure their integrity.
* **Regularly audit dotfiles:** Periodically review dotfiles for potential security issues.
* **Avoid sourcing untrusted dotfiles:** Only use dotfiles from sources you trust completely.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Editor Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_editor_configuration.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious code into editor configuration files (e.g., `.vimrc`, `.emacs`).

**How Dotfiles Contribute to the Attack Surface:** Dotfiles customize editor behavior, including the execution of scripts or commands upon certain events (e.g., opening a file).

**Example:** An attacker adds an autocommand to `.vimrc` that executes a malicious script whenever a specific file type is opened.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, editor takeover.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Review editor configuration files:** Carefully examine editor configuration files for suspicious autocommands, functions, or plugin configurations.
* **Be cautious with editor plugins:** Only install plugins from trusted sources and keep them updated.
* **Disable or restrict potentially dangerous editor features:**  Consider disabling features that allow arbitrary code execution if not strictly necessary.
* **Use editor security plugins:** Some editors have plugins that can help detect and prevent malicious configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Dotfiles](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_dotfiles.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, private keys) directly within dotfiles.

**How Dotfiles Contribute to the Attack Surface:** Dotfiles are often stored in plain text and can be easily accessed if the system or repository is compromised.

**Example:** A user stores their database password directly in their `.bashrc` file as an environment variable.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive accounts or resources, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never store secrets directly in dotfiles:** Use dedicated secrets management tools or environment variable managers.
* **Utilize password managers:** Store credentials securely in dedicated password management applications.
* **Employ environment variable encryption:** If environment variables are used for sensitive data, encrypt them.
* **Implement proper access controls:** Restrict access to dotfiles repositories and the systems where they are deployed.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Dotfile Installation Scripts](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_dotfile_installation_scripts.md)

**Description:** Malicious code is introduced through scripts used to install or update dotfiles.

**How Dotfiles Contribute to the Attack Surface:** Dotfiles often include scripts to automate their setup and configuration. If these scripts are compromised, they can execute malicious code during the installation process.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a script that downloads and installs dependencies for the dotfiles, injecting malicious code into the downloaded files.

**Impact:** System compromise, installation of malware, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Carefully review installation scripts:** Thoroughly examine any scripts used to install or update dotfiles before execution.
* **Verify script sources:** Ensure that installation scripts are downloaded from trusted and secure sources.
* **Use checksums or signatures for script verification:** Verify the integrity of downloaded scripts before running them.
* **Run installation scripts in isolated environments:** Test installation scripts in virtual machines or containers before applying them to production systems.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation via Dotfile Configurations](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_via_dotfile_configurations.md)

**Description:** Dotfile configurations inadvertently grant elevated privileges or create vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation.

**How Dotfiles Contribute to the Attack Surface:** Dotfiles can configure system settings or tools that, if misconfigured, can lead to privilege escalation.

**Example:** A dotfile configuration sets insecure permissions on a file or directory, allowing an attacker to modify it and gain elevated privileges.

**Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to system resources, complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Adhere to the principle of least privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions in dotfile configurations.
* **Regularly review file and directory permissions:** Ensure that permissions set by dotfiles are secure.
* **Avoid using `sudo` or running commands with elevated privileges within dotfile configurations unless absolutely necessary.**
* **Use security linters and static analysis tools:**  Employ tools that can identify potential security vulnerabilities in dotfile configurations.
