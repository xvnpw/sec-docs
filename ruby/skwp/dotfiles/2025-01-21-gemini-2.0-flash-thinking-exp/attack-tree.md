## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dotfile Source Repository (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dotfile_source_repository__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

If the application uses dotfiles managed in a repository, compromising it allows for widespread attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validationsanitization__high-risk_path_.md)

The application fails to properly validate or sanitize dotfile content before using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application directly executes commands or scripts defined in dotfiles without proper sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_directly_executes_commands_or_scripts_defined_in_dotfiles_without_proper_sanitization__h_4f7860b2.md)
