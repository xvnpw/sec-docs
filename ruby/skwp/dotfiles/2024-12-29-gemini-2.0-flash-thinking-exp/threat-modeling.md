* **Threat:** Malicious Alias Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker could compromise the `skwp/dotfiles` repository or a user's local copy and inject a malicious alias into shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) provided by the dotfiles. When a user executes a seemingly benign command, the malicious alias is executed instead, potentially performing harmful actions. For example, an alias for `sudo` could be created to silently steal passwords.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, system compromise, execution of arbitrary commands with user privileges.
    * **Affected Component:** Shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Manually inspect all shell configuration files for suspicious commands, aliases, and function definitions after incorporating or updating dotfiles from the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
        * Regularly review changes in the upstream `skwp/dotfiles` repository before pulling updates.
        * Consider forking the `skwp/dotfiles` repository and maintaining a local, vetted version.
        * Implement shell command auditing to track executed commands.

* **Threat:** Malicious Function Definition
    * **Description:** Similar to malicious aliases, an attacker could inject malicious function definitions into shell configuration files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository. These functions could be designed to execute harmful code when called, potentially triggered by specific commands or events. For instance, a function triggered on login could download and execute a backdoor.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, persistent malware installation, data exfiltration.
    * **Affected Component:** Shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Scrutinize all function definitions within shell configuration files from the `skwp/dotfiles` repository for unexpected or suspicious code.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan dotfiles from the `skwp/dotfiles` repository for potentially malicious patterns.
        * Limit the sourcing of external scripts within shell configurations provided by the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.

* **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files
    * **Description:** Developers contributing to or modifying the `skwp/dotfiles` repository might inadvertently store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal URLs directly within configuration files managed by the dotfiles (e.g., within shell scripts or application-specific configuration files included in the repository). Users adopting these dotfiles would then be exposed.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to systems or services, data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Various configuration files within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository (e.g., shell scripts, application configuration files).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical if highly sensitive secrets are exposed.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing secrets directly in dotfiles within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository.
        * Implement automated checks within the `skwp/dotfiles` repository to prevent committing sensitive information.
        * Users adopting the dotfiles should utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions instead of relying on hardcoded values.
