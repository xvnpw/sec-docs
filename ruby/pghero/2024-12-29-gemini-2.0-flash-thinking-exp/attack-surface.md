Here are the key attack surfaces directly involving PgHero, with high and critical severity:

* **Attack Surface: Database Credentials Exposure**
    * **Description:** The application needs to store database credentials (username, password, host, port, database name) for PgHero to connect to the PostgreSQL instance. Insecure storage or handling of these credentials can lead to unauthorized access.
    * **How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero necessitates these credentials to function, making their secure management a direct concern introduced by its integration.
    * **Example:** Database credentials hardcoded in the application's source code, stored in plain text configuration files accessible via the web server, or exposed through insufficiently protected environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize environment variables for storing database credentials, ensuring proper access controls on the environment where the application runs.
        * Employ secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and access credentials.
        * Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code or configuration files.
        * Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

* **Attack Surface: Information Disclosure through PgHero Interface**
    * **Description:** PgHero provides a web interface that displays sensitive database performance metrics, configuration details, and potentially query samples. Lack of proper authentication and authorization can expose this information to unauthorized users.
    * **How PgHero Contributes:** PgHero *is* the source of this potentially sensitive information and provides the interface to access it.
    * **Example:** An unauthenticated PgHero interface accessible on a public network, allowing anyone to view database statistics, running queries, and configuration details.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain valuable insights into the database structure, performance characteristics, and potential vulnerabilities, aiding in further attacks or reconnaissance.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the PgHero interface. Integrate with the application's existing authentication system if possible.
        * Restrict access to the PgHero interface to authorized users or IP addresses only.
        * Deploy PgHero on an internal network or behind a firewall, limiting external access.
        * Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication capabilities in front of the PgHero application.
