        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the absence of proper input sanitization or the failure to use parameterized queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the structure and logic of SQL queries.

**Exploit Database Access Vulnerabilities via pghero (Critical Node):**

* **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities related to how pghero accesses and interacts with the underlying database.

**Leverage pghero's Database Connection for Malicious Queries:**

* **Description:**  If an attacker gains access to pghero, they might be able to leverage its existing database connection to execute unauthorized queries.
    * **Execute Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion:**

        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * **Attack Vector:** Using pghero's database connection to execute SQL commands that modify or delete sensitive data.
    * **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from the Database:**

    * **Use Compromised Credentials to Directly Access the Database:**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: High
        * **Attack Vector:** Using the compromised database credentials to directly connect to the database, bypassing pghero entirely.

**Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in pghero:**

* **Description:** This path involves exploiting insecure configurations or misconfigurations in pghero's deployment.

**Exploit Misconfigurations in pghero Deployment:**

* **Description:** This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how pghero is deployed and configured within the application environment.
