# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals
  - Provide a robust and flexible library for generating fake data in Ruby.
  - Support developers in creating realistic and comprehensive test data.
  - Maintain an active and helpful open-source community around the library.
  - Ensure the library is easy to use, well-documented, and extensible.
  - Continuously improve the library with new data types and features based on community needs.
- Business Risks
  - Risk of decreased adoption if the library becomes unreliable or difficult to use.
  - Risk of community dissatisfaction if feature requests and bug reports are not addressed.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities in the library code that could be exploited by malicious actors if used in unexpected contexts.
  - Risk of supply chain compromise if dependencies are vulnerable or the build process is insecure.
  - Risk of reputational damage if the library is perceived as low quality or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository management and access control. (Implemented: GitHub repository settings)
  - security control: Open-source project with community review, increasing code visibility and potential for identifying vulnerabilities. (Implemented: Open Source nature of the project)
  - security control: Dependency management using Bundler and `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. (Implemented: Gemfile and Bundler)
  - security control: Automated testing suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented: GitHub Actions workflows running tests)
- Accepted Risks
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching, which may have delays.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately patched.
  - accepted risk: Risk of unintentional security issues introduced by contributors.
- Recommended Security Controls
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security flaws in the code.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - recommended security control: Regularly review and update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
  - recommended security control: Consider signing releases to ensure authenticity and integrity of distributed gems.
- Security Requirements
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* Faker, but not Faker itself.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* Faker, but not Faker itself. Access control to the GitHub repository is managed by GitHub.
  - Input Validation: Faker should validate inputs such as locale codes and format strings to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. This is important to ensure the library functions correctly and predictably.
  - Cryptography: Faker itself is not intended for cryptographic purposes. However, if Faker is used to generate data that resembles sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers), it is crucial to emphasize that this data is *fake* and should not be used in real-world security contexts. Faker should not implement any cryptographic functionality.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes
  - For Faker library itself: Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Faker Ruby gem on RubyGems.org. Ensuring the library remains useful and reliable for developers.
  - For users of Faker:  Development and testing processes that rely on realistic fake data generated by Faker.
- Data Sensitivity
  - Code: The Faker library's source code is publicly available on GitHub. The integrity of the code is important to prevent malicious modifications.
  - Fake Data: The data generated by Faker is intentionally fake and not sensitive. However, it's important to ensure that users understand it is fake and do not misuse it as real, sensitive data.
  - Dependencies: Dependencies of Faker are external open-source libraries. Vulnerabilities in dependencies could pose a risk.
  - Build Artifacts (Gem): The built gem package is a distributable artifact. Its integrity is important to prevent supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions
  - Are there any specific security concerns related to the usage of Faker in particular contexts (e.g., generating data for applications that handle sensitive information, even if the data is fake)?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements that the Faker library needs to adhere to (unlikely for a fake data generation library, but worth confirming)?
  - Is there a formal security incident response plan in place for the Faker project?
- Assumptions
  - Assumption: The primary goal of Faker is to provide a useful tool for developers, not to handle or secure real-world sensitive data.
  - Assumption: Standard open-source development practices are followed, including community contributions and public code review.
  - Assumption: Security is considered important for the project, but resources are likely limited to community contributions and volunteer efforts.
  - Assumption: The target audience for this design document is concerned with the general security posture of the Faker library and its potential risks, rather than specific application-level security concerns when using Faker.
