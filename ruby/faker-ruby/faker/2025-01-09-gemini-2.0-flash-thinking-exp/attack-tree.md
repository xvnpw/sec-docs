## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Data for Injection Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/generate_data_for_injection_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Generate Data for Injection Attacks (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Generate Data for SQL Injection (Critical Node):**
        *   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious SQL Queries via Faker-generated strings used in database interactions.
    *   **Generate Data for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Critical Node):**
        *   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious JavaScript via Faker-generated strings displayed in the UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Trust in Faker Data (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_trust_in_faker_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Application's Trust in Faker Data (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Application Uses Faker Data in Security-Sensitive Contexts (Critical Node):**
        *   **Use Faker Data Directly for Authentication/Authorization (Critical Node):**
            *   Attack Vector: Bypass Authentication/Authorization if Faker generates predictable or easily guessable values (HIGHLY UNLIKELY IN REAL-WORLD, BUT POSSIBLE IF MISUSED).
        *   **Use Faker Data to Generate Security Tokens/Keys (Critical Node):**
            *   Attack Vector: Compromise Security if Faker's randomness is insufficient or predictable.
    *   **Application Logs or Exposes Faker Data Inappropriately (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Log Sensitive Information Generated by Faker (Critical Node):**
            *   Attack Vector: Expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data if Faker is misused to generate realistic-looking but sensitive data in non-production environments and these logs are accessible.
        *   **Display Faker Data Without Proper Sanitization (Critical Node):**
            *   Attack Vector: Lead to XSS vulnerabilities if Faker generates strings containing malicious scripts.
