# Threat Model Analysis for faker-ruby/faker

## Threat: [Data Corruption in Production Due to Accidental Faker Execution](./threats/data_corruption_in_production_due_to_accidental_faker_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability or take advantage of misconfiguration to trigger Faker code within the production environment, leading to the overwriting or modification of real data with fake data. This directly involves the execution of Faker's data generation functions in an unintended environment.
*   **Impact:** Loss of critical business data, data inconsistencies, application malfunction, and potential financial losses.
*   **Affected Faker Component:** Data Generation (all modules and functions that generate data).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strict separation of development/testing and production environments.
    *   Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized code execution in production.
    *   Utilize infrastructure-as-code and configuration management to ensure consistent and secure deployments.
    *   Implement database backups and recovery procedures to mitigate data loss.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Leading to Malicious Faker Library](./threats/dependency_confusion_leading_to_malicious_faker_library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially upload a malicious package to a public or private package repository with the same name as `faker-ruby/faker` or a closely related name, hoping that developers will accidentally install the malicious version. This directly involves the installation of a compromised library intended to be `faker-ruby/faker`.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malware, backdoors, or other malicious code within the application's dependencies, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Faker Component:** The library as a whole (dependency management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always verify the integrity and source of dependencies.
    *   Use dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    *   Implement security scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Use private package repositories with strict access controls if possible.
