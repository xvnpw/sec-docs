# Attack Surface Analysis for faker-ruby/faker

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **How Faker Contributes:** If Faker-generated strings are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, malicious strings generated by Faker (or carefully crafted custom providers) could be interpreted as SQL commands.
*   **Example:**  Imagine a query like `User.where("name = '#{Faker::Name.name}'")`. If `Faker::Name.name` generates a string like `'; DROP TABLE users; --`, this could execute a destructive SQL command.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data corruption, unauthorized access, complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** This ensures that Faker-generated data is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   **Implement robust input validation:** Even if using parameterized queries, validate the *type* and *format* of Faker-generated data before using it in queries.
        *   **Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with string interpolation:** This is the primary vulnerability point.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **How Faker Contributes:** Faker can generate strings containing HTML tags or JavaScript code. If this generated content is directly rendered in a web page without proper encoding, these scripts can execute in the user's browser.
*   **Example:** If `Faker::Lorem.paragraph` generates a string containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and this is displayed on a page without encoding, the alert will execute.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement of websites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Implement output encoding (escaping):**  Encode Faker-generated data before displaying it in HTML. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript contexts).
        *   **Use templating engines with auto-escaping features:** Most modern web frameworks provide this functionality.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations, even internal resources.
*   **How Faker Contributes:** If Faker is used to generate URLs (e.g., for testing or demonstration purposes) and these generated URLs are then used by the server to make external requests without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the generated URL to target internal services or external malicious sites.
*   **Example:** If your application uses `RestClient.get(Faker::Internet.url)` without validating the generated URL, an attacker might influence the Faker output (if controllable) to point to an internal service like `http://localhost:6379/` to interact with Redis.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, launching attacks from the server's IP address.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Validate and sanitize URLs:** Before making requests with Faker-generated URLs, rigorously validate them against a whitelist of allowed domains and protocols.
        *   **Avoid directly using Faker output for critical URL generation:** If possible, use more controlled methods for generating URLs in production code.
        *   **Implement network segmentation:** Restrict the server's access to internal resources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Providers](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_providers.md)

*   **Description:** If your application uses custom Faker providers, these can introduce vulnerabilities if they are not carefully written or if they are compromised.
*   **How Faker Contributes:** Custom providers have the potential to generate arbitrary strings or even execute code during the data generation process. A malicious provider could inject harmful data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Example:** A compromised custom provider for generating names could be designed to consistently return strings containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**  Any of the above vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.), remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the provider's capabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Thoroughly review and audit custom provider code:** Treat custom providers with the same scrutiny as any other part of your application.
        *   **Implement code signing or other integrity checks for custom providers:** Ensure that providers haven't been tampered with.
        *   **Limit the capabilities of custom providers:** Design your Faker setup to restrict what custom providers can do.
