# Threat Model Analysis for faker-ruby/faker

## Threat: [Introduction of Malicious Code through Custom Faker Providers](./threats/introduction_of_malicious_code_through_custom_faker_providers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise or create a malicious custom Faker provider. If an application uses this compromised provider, the attacker's code could be executed within the application's context when Faker attempts to generate data using that provider. This could lead to remote code execution or other severe compromises.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, full system compromise, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Affected Faker Component:** Custom or Community Providers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control the sources of custom Faker providers. Only use providers from highly trusted and well-vetted sources.
    *   Thoroughly review the code of any custom or community-contributed Faker providers before integrating them into the application.
    *   Implement code signing and verification mechanisms for custom providers if possible.
    *   Regularly audit the list of used Faker providers and their origins.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Faker or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_faker_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities present in the `faker-ruby/faker` library itself or in its underlying dependencies. If the application uses a vulnerable version of Faker or its dependencies, attackers could leverage these flaws to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, impacts can range from remote code execution and data breaches to denial of service and information disclosure. This can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
*   **Affected Faker Component:** The entire library and its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a high-severity vulnerability exists in Faker or a direct dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain an up-to-date version of the `faker-ruby/faker` library. Regularly check for and apply security updates.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify known vulnerabilities in Faker and its dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities by updating dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Ruby and the Faker library to stay informed about potential threats.
