# Attack Surface Analysis for faker-ruby/faker

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection Vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_vulnerabilities__xss__sqli__command_injection__etc__.md)

* **Description:** The application uses data generated by Faker in contexts where it can be interpreted as code, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    * **How Faker Contributes:** Faker generates strings that might contain characters or patterns exploitable in injection attacks. It provides diverse data formats, some of which can inadvertently include malicious payloads if not handled properly.
    * **Example:** An application uses `Faker::Quote.famous_last_words` to display a random quote on a webpage without proper HTML escaping. If the generated quote contains a `<script>` tag, it leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS), unauthorized access or modification of database data (SQLi), or execution of arbitrary commands on the server (Command Injection).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Context-Specific Output Encoding/Escaping:** Always encode or escape Faker-generated data appropriately for the context where it's used (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages, SQL parameterization for database queries).
        * **Input Validation (even for Faker data):** While Faker generates data, validate its format and content before using it in sensitive operations as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can trigger the application to generate a large amount of fake data using Faker, overwhelming system resources.
    * **How Faker Contributes:** Faker provides methods capable of generating substantial amounts of data (e.g., long paragraphs, large arrays). If an attacker can control or influence the parameters of these methods, they can cause resource exhaustion.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint uses `Faker::Lorem.paragraphs(number: user_provided_count)` to generate paragraphs based on user input. An attacker could send a request with a very large `user_provided_count`, causing the server to consume excessive CPU and memory.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Limit Data Generation:** Impose strict limits on the amount of data that can be generated by Faker methods, especially if parameters are influenced by user input.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or features utilizing Faker to prevent excessive requests.
        * **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for data generation processes to prevent them from running indefinitely.
