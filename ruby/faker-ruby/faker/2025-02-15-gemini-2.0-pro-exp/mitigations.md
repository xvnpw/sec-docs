# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for faker-ruby/faker

## Mitigation Strategy: [Seed Management](./mitigation_strategies/seed_management.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Random Seeds for General Testing:**  For most test scenarios, explicitly initialize `faker` with a new, cryptographically secure random seed for *each* test run.  Use `Random.new_seed` to generate the seed and then initialize `Faker::Config.random` with a `Random` object using that seed.
    ```ruby
    Faker::Config.random = Random.new(Random.new_seed)
    ```
2.  **Explicit Seeds for Reproducibility:** When reproducibility is required, use an explicit seed, but *never* hardcode it.  Retrieve the seed from an environment variable or a secure configuration store.
    ```ruby
    if ENV['FAKER_SEED']
      Faker::Config.random = Random.new(ENV['FAKER_SEED'].to_i)
    else
      Faker::Config.random = Random.new(Random.new_seed) # Fallback to random
    end
    ```
3.  **Seed Rotation:**  Even for explicit seeds used for reproducibility, implement a policy to periodically change these seeds.  The frequency depends on the sensitivity of the data and risk assessment.
4.  **Avoid Default Seed:** Explicitly *avoid* relying on the default `faker` seed.  Always set a seed, either random or a controlled explicit one.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Predictable Data (Severity: Medium):**  Directly addresses the predictability of `faker`'s output when using the default or a fixed seed.
    *   **Test Flakiness (Severity: Low):**  Ensures test independence by avoiding reliance on a specific, uncontrolled `faker` data sequence.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Low - specific scenarios):** Mitigates replay attacks if `faker` data is used in contexts like nonce generation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Predictable Data:** Risk significantly reduced by controlling the seed.
    *   **Test Flakiness:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk mitigated in relevant scenarios.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Random seeds are used by default in all test suites (via a global `before(:all)` hook in RSpec).
    *   Environment variable `FAKER_SEED` is used for setting explicit seeds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal seed rotation policy is not defined.
    *   Documentation of explicit seeds and their purposes needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Data Generation](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_data_generation.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Minimal Data:**  Generate only the *minimum* amount of data needed.  Avoid unnecessary calls to `faker` methods.
2.  **Specific Generators:**  Always use the most specific `faker` generator available for the data type you need.  Favor:
    *   `Faker::Lorem.sentence` over `Faker::Lorem.paragraph`
    *   `Faker::Internet.email` over `Faker::Lorem.word` for email fields
    *   `Faker::Address.zip_code` over `Faker::Number.number(digits: 5)`
    *   ...and so on.  Consult the `faker` documentation for the most appropriate generator.
3.  **Custom Generators:**  If `faker` does not provide a generator that meets your specific requirements (e.g., a particular data format, a constrained range of values, or a specific distribution), create a *custom* generator. This gives you the most precise control over the generated data.
    ```ruby
    module CustomFaker
      def self.product_code
        "PRD-" + Faker::Number.number(digits: 6).to_s
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Issues (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the overhead of generating unnecessary data.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Minimizes the risk of `faker` consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Data Inconsistency (Severity: Low):** Using specific and custom generators improves data consistency and validity.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium - in testing environments):** Limits the potential for `faker` to be used to cause a DoS in the testing environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Issues:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced.
    * **Denial of Service:** Risk mitigated in testing environments.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developers are encouraged to use specific generators.
    *   Some custom generators exist.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal guidelines for data generation limits are not documented.
    *   More comprehensive use of custom generators could be beneficial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Locale Awareness](./mitigation_strategies/locale_awareness.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Explicit Locale:**  *Always* explicitly set the desired locale using `Faker::Config.locale`.  Do *not* rely on the default locale.
    ```ruby
    Faker::Config.locale = 'en-US' # Or any other required locale
    ```
2.  **Consistent Locale:**  Use a consistent locale throughout your testing environment to avoid unexpected variations in data.
3.  **Multi-Locale Testing (if applicable):** If your application supports multiple locales, include tests that specifically set different `faker` locales to ensure correct handling of internationalized data.
    ```ruby
    it 'handles different locales' do
      ['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP'].each do |locale|
        Faker::Config.locale = locale
        # ... test logic ...
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Format Errors (Severity: Low):** Prevents issues caused by unexpected data formats (dates, numbers, etc.) due to incorrect locale settings.
    *   **Character Encoding Issues (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of character encoding problems.
    *   **Localization Bugs (Severity: Low):** Helps identify localization bugs early.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Format Errors:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Character Encoding Issues:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Localization Bugs:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Faker::Config.locale` is set to 'en-US' in the test environment setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Multi-locale testing is not currently implemented.
    *   Documentation on locale usage could be improved.
