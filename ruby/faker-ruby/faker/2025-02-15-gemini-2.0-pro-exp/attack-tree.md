## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Large Data Generation `{CRITICAL}`
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application where user input controls the amount of data generated by Faker. By providing a very large input value, the attacker triggers the generation of an excessive amount of data, consuming server resources (CPU, memory) and leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on any user-supplied values that influence the quantity of data generated by Faker.  Set reasonable limits on the number of items, string lengths, etc.
        *   Enforce resource limits (e.g., memory limits, timeouts) within the application to prevent runaway processes.
        *   Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) to detect potential DoS attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Leakage / Privacy Violation via Deterministic Data Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/data_leakage__privacy_violation_via_deterministic_data_exposure.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Use of `Faker::Config.locale` `{CRITICAL}` to generate sensitive data, followed by `Accidental Exposure` `{CRITICAL}`.
    *   **Description:** The application uses `Faker::Config.locale` to generate data that is considered sensitive (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, names associated with a specific locale). This data is then unintentionally exposed through various means, such as:
        *   **Logging:** Sensitive Faker-generated data is included in application logs.
        *   **Error Messages:** Error messages displayed to users inadvertently reveal Faker-generated data.
        *   **Debugging Output:** Debugging information containing Faker data is left enabled in production.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (can be High depending on the specific data exposed)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (for accidental exposure); Low (for finding the locale usage)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (for accidental exposure); Intermediate (for finding the locale usage)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (for accidental exposure); Medium (for finding the locale usage)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Review Locale Usage:** Carefully review all instances where `Faker::Config.locale` is used. Avoid using it to generate data that will be exposed to users or logged in production.  Consider using a default, generic locale if possible, or no locale at all.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only generate the *minimum* amount of Faker data required. Don't generate unnecessary fields.
        *   **Secure Logging:** Configure logging to *never* include sensitive data, including Faker-generated data. Use a logging library that supports redaction or masking of sensitive fields.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that returns generic error messages to users.  Never expose internal details, including Faker-generated data, in error messages.
        *   **Disable Debugging Output:** Ensure that all debugging output is disabled in production environments.
        * **Sanitize Output:** Before displaying any Faker-generated data to users, or including it in logs, sanitize the data. This might involve redacting sensitive parts or replacing them with placeholders.
