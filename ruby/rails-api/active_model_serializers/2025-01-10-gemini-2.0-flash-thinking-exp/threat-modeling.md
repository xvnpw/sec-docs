# Threat Model Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

## Threat: [Over-serialization of Sensitive Data](./threats/over-serialization_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft requests targeting API endpoints that utilize a serializer which inadvertently exposes sensitive attributes or associations of a model. This could be achieved by simply accessing a resource through the API or by manipulating parameters to trigger the serialization of related data that contains sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of confidential user data, internal system details, or business logic. This can lead to privacy violations, identity theft, or further attacks based on the exposed information.

**Affected Component:** Serializer class definition (attributes, associations)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly define the attributes to be included in each serializer using the `attributes` method.
* Carefully review and restrict the associations included in serializers using the `has_one`, `has_many`, and `belongs_to` methods, ensuring only necessary and non-sensitive related data is exposed.
* Utilize conditional logic within serializers (e.g., `if:`, `unless:`, or custom methods) to dynamically control which attributes or associations are included based on user roles, permissions, or context.
* Consider using different serializers for different API endpoints or user roles to tailor the data exposure appropriately.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Associations Leading to Unintended Data Exposure](./threats/insecure_handling_of_associations_leading_to_unintended_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in how associations are handled during serialization. For example, if a serializer eagerly loads and exposes all attributes of an associated model without proper filtering, it could reveal sensitive data from the associated model that should not be accessible.

**Impact:** Similar to over-serialization, this can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data residing in related database tables or models.

**Affected Component:** Association handling within serializers (`has_one`, `has_many`, `belongs_to`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly specify the attributes to be included for associated models within the serializer definition using nested serializers or the `fields` option within association declarations.
* Implement authorization checks within serializers or the associated models to ensure the current user has permission to view the associated data before it is included in the response.
* Be mindful of the default behavior of association handling and ensure it aligns with the intended data exposure policy.
