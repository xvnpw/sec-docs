## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serialization Logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serialization_logic__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks that focus on manipulating the process of selecting and preparing data for serialization. If successful, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulate the data being sent to clients.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Attribute Filtering/Inclusion [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_attribute_filteringinclusion__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of developers unintentionally including sensitive attributes in the serialized output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Inclusion of Sensitive Attributes [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/force_inclusion_of_sensitive_attributes__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers can craft specific API requests targeting endpoints or resources where sensitive attributes are mistakenly included in the response. This directly leads to the exposure of confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Relationship Handling [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_relationship_handling__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Active Model Serializers manages relationships between models.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improperly Scoped Relationships [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/improperly_scoped_relationships__high_risk_path_.md)

If relationships are not properly scoped based on user permissions, attackers can exploit this to access related data belonging to other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Unintended Related Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_unintended_related_data__high_risk_path_.md)

By manipulating requests or exploiting the lack of proper scoping, attackers can retrieve related data that the current user should not have access to, potentially revealing private information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializer Logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializer_logic__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node emphasizes the risks associated with extending Active Model Serializers with custom logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Custom Methods [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_custom_methods__high_risk_path_.md)

Custom methods within serializers might inadvertently expose sensitive data or internal logic through the API response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Sensitive Information [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_sensitive_information__high_risk_path_.md)

Through flawed custom methods, attackers can gain access to confidential data that should not be exposed through the API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Output Format/Content [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_output_formatcontent__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This represents a category of attacks focused on influencing the final serialized output. Successful attacks can lead to client-side vulnerabilities or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Content Injection via Custom Attributes/Methods [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/content_injection_via_custom_attributesmethods__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of injecting malicious content into the API response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Content [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_content__high_risk_path_.md)

If custom attributes or methods don't properly sanitize or escape data, especially data derived from user input or external sources, attackers can inject malicious content (e.g., XSS payloads) into the API response, potentially compromising client-side security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Complex Serializations [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_complex_serializations__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node focuses on the potential for attackers to overload the server through the serialization process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overloading the Server [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/overloading_the_server__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers can craft requests that trigger the serialization of extremely large or deeply nested data structures, consuming significant server resources and potentially leading to a denial of service.
