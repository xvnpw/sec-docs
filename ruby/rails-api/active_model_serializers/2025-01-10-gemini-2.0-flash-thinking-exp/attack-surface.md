# Attack Surface Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

## Attack Surface: [Over-serialization / Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/over-serialization__information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** The serializer includes sensitive or unnecessary data in the API response that should not be exposed to the client.
    *   **How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** Incorrect configuration of serializers (e.g., using `attributes :all` without careful consideration), or forgetting to exclude sensitive attributes using `except:` or `if:` conditions, leads to their inclusion in the output.
    *   **Example:** A `UserSerializer` might inadvertently include the `password_digest` or `social_security_number` attributes in the JSON response if not explicitly excluded.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for identity theft, privacy violations, and compliance breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly define the attributes to be included in the serializer using the `attributes` method with a specific list.
        *   Use `except:` or conditional logic (`if:`, `unless:`) within the `attributes` block to exclude sensitive attributes based on context or authorization.
        *   Regularly review serializer definitions to ensure they align with current security requirements.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Attribute Methods](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_attribute_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Custom methods defined within serializers to generate attribute values can introduce vulnerabilities if they perform unsafe operations or access sensitive resources without proper authorization.
    *   **How Active Model Serializers Contributes:**  The flexibility of AMS allows defining custom methods within serializers using `attribute :custom_attribute do ... end`. If these methods are not carefully implemented, they can become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** A custom attribute method fetches data from an external service without proper authentication or sanitizes user input incorrectly, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for injection attacks (e.g., command injection if interacting with the operating system), unauthorized access to external resources, or denial of service if the custom method is resource-intensive.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the actions performed by the custom method).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom attribute methods for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place before accessing sensitive resources within custom methods.
        *   Sanitize any user-provided input used within custom methods to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Avoid performing computationally expensive or potentially blocking operations within serializer methods.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Relationships](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_relationships.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly configured or missing authorization checks when serializing related models can lead to unauthorized access to associated data.
    *   **How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** AMS provides mechanisms to include related models using `has_one`, `has_many`, and `belongs_to`. If authorization is not enforced when including these relationships, sensitive data from related models might be exposed.
    *   **Example:** A `UserSerializer` includes `has_many :private_documents`. If there's no check to ensure the requesting user has access to these documents, they will be included in the response, even if the user shouldn't see them.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to related entities, privacy violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks within serializers or at the application level before including related models.
        *   Use conditional logic within relationship definitions (`if:`, `unless:`) to control when relationships are included based on authorization.
        *   Consider using separate serializers for related models with appropriate authorization rules.
