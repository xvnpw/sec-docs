## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Accessing Unintended Related Data [HIGH RISK PATH]

This analysis delves into the "Accessing Unintended Related Data" attack path within the context of an application using `active_model_serializers`. We'll break down the potential vulnerabilities, explore how attackers might exploit them, and provide actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The core of this attack path lies in the potential for attackers to gain access to data associated with a resource that they are not explicitly authorized to view. This happens when the application, through its API endpoints and the use of `active_model_serializers`, inadvertently exposes related data based on the current user's request, even if the user lacks the necessary permissions for that related data.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

`active_model_serializers` is designed to transform model data into JSON or other formats for API responses. It often involves including related data through associations defined in the Rails models. The vulnerability arises when the inclusion of these relationships isn't properly controlled or authorized.

**Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques:**

1. **Direct Manipulation of `include` Parameter:**

   * **Vulnerability:**  Many APIs using `active_model_serializers` allow clients to specify which related resources to include in the response using a query parameter like `include`. If the backend doesn't properly validate and authorize these inclusions, an attacker can request related data they shouldn't have access to.
   * **Exploitation:** An attacker might modify the `include` parameter to request related resources that belong to other users or are otherwise restricted.

   ```
   # Example Request:
   GET /api/users/123?include=posts,private_messages
   ```

   If the application blindly includes `private_messages` without checking if the current user has access to those messages associated with user `123`, sensitive information could be leaked.

2. **Exploiting Default Inclusion of Relationships:**

   * **Vulnerability:**  Serializers can be configured to include certain relationships by default. If these default inclusions involve sensitive data and the authorization checks are insufficient or non-existent, attackers can passively receive this data.
   * **Exploitation:** An attacker might simply make a standard request to an endpoint and receive unauthorized related data that is automatically included in the response.

   ```ruby
   # Example Serializer:
   class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
     attributes :id, :name, :email
     has_many :private_documents  # Included by default
   end
   ```

   If the authorization logic for accessing `private_documents` is flawed or missing, any user fetching user data could potentially see the IDs of private documents associated with that user.

3. **Lack of Scoping in Relationship Loading:**

   * **Vulnerability:**  When loading related data, the application might not apply proper scoping based on the current user's permissions. This means it fetches all related records, even those the user isn't authorized to see.
   * **Exploitation:** An attacker might trigger the loading of a relationship, and the backend fetches all associated records. The serializer then filters the attributes, but the existence and potentially some metadata (like IDs) of unauthorized related records might be exposed.

   For example, a user might request their own profile, which triggers the loading of all comments on their posts, even comments made by other users that the current user shouldn't be able to see directly.

4. **Inconsistent Authorization Logic:**

   * **Vulnerability:** Authorization checks might be implemented inconsistently across different endpoints or relationships. A user might be authorized to see a related resource through one endpoint but not through another.
   * **Exploitation:** An attacker might discover an endpoint where the authorization for a specific relationship is weaker or missing and exploit that to access unintended data.

5. **Bypassing Authorization Logic through Parameter Manipulation:**

   * **Vulnerability:** If authorization logic relies heavily on specific parameters or conditions that can be manipulated by the client, attackers might find ways to bypass these checks.
   * **Exploitation:** An attacker might craft requests with specific parameter values that trick the authorization logic into granting access to related data.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider an application with `User` and `Order` models, where a user can have multiple orders. A serializer might look like this:

```ruby
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  has_many :orders
end
```

If the API endpoint `/api/users/123` returns the serialized user data, and the authorization logic doesn't check if the current user is the owner of the orders being included, any authenticated user fetching user 123's data could see their order details, which might contain sensitive information like purchase history and addresses.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Strong Authorization on Relationship Inclusion:**

   * **Validate `include` Parameters:** Implement strict validation on the `include` parameter. Only allow inclusion of relationships that the current user is authorized to access in the context of the requested resource.
   * **Context-Aware Authorization:**  When including relationships, ensure the authorization logic considers the context of both the parent and the related resource. For example, when including orders for a user, verify that the current user is the owner of those orders.

   ```ruby
   # Example using Pundit for authorization:
   class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
     attributes :id, :name

     has_many :orders do |serializer|
       Pundit.policy(serializer.scope, serializer.object).show_orders?
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Control Default Relationship Inclusion:**

   * **Be Explicit:** Avoid including sensitive relationships by default. Only include relationships that are generally safe to expose or where authorization is strictly enforced.
   * **Conditional Inclusion:** Use conditional logic within the serializer to include relationships based on the current user's roles or permissions.

   ```ruby
   class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
     attributes :id, :name

     has_many :private_documents, if: -> { scope.admin? }
   end
   ```

3. **Implement Scoping for Relationship Loading:**

   * **Apply Scopes:** When fetching related data, apply database scopes or custom logic to filter the results based on the current user's permissions. This ensures that only authorized related records are loaded in the first place.

   ```ruby
   # Example using a scope in the Order model:
   class Order < ApplicationRecord
     belongs_to :user
     scope :accessible_by, -> (user) { where(user: user) }
   end

   class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
     attributes :id, :name
     has_many :orders do |serializer|
       serializer.object.orders.accessible_by(serializer.scope)
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Consistent and Robust Authorization Framework:**

   * **Use a Dedicated Authorization Library:** Employ well-established authorization gems like Pundit or CanCanCan to enforce consistent authorization rules throughout the application.
   * **Centralized Authorization Logic:** Avoid scattering authorization checks across different parts of the codebase. Centralize the logic for easier maintenance and auditing.

5. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

   * **Validate Input:** Thoroughly validate all input parameters, including the `include` parameter, to prevent unexpected or malicious values.
   * **Whitelist Allowed Inclusions:** Instead of blacklisting, maintain a whitelist of allowed relationships that can be included.

6. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

   * **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities related to unauthorized data access.
   * **Focus on Relationship Handling:** Pay close attention to how relationships are handled in the API and ensure that authorization is correctly implemented at each step.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Using Pundit for Authorization:**

```ruby
# app/policies/order_policy.rb
class OrderPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    user.admin? || record.user == user
  end
end

# app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  has_many :orders do |serializer|
    serializer.object.orders.select { |order| Pundit.policy(serializer.scope, order).show? }
  end
end
```

**Conditional Inclusion in Serializer:**

```ruby
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :sensitive_data, if: :is_admin?

  def is_admin?
    scope.admin? # Assuming 'scope' represents the current user
  end
end
```

**Further Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Avoid providing overly detailed error messages that could reveal the existence of unauthorized related data.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity, such as repeated attempts to access unauthorized data.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the API and data model based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary access to perform their tasks.

**Conclusion:**

The "Accessing Unintended Related Data" attack path is a significant risk when using `active_model_serializers` if proper authorization and scoping are not implemented. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information through API endpoints. A proactive and security-conscious approach to relationship handling within serializers is crucial for building secure and robust applications. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews and updates are essential to address evolving threats.
