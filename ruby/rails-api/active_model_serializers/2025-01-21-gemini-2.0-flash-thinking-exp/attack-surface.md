# Attack Surface Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

## Attack Surface: [Over-Serialization and Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/over-serialization_and_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** Unintentional inclusion of sensitive or internal attributes in the API response due to incorrect serializer configuration.

**How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** AMS controls which attributes and relationships are included in the serialized output. Misconfiguration or lack of explicit attribute whitelisting can lead to over-exposure.

**Example:** A `UserSerializer` might inadvertently include the `password_digest` attribute in the API response if not explicitly excluded or if a base serializer includes it by default.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive user data, internal system details, or business logic, potentially leading to account compromise, further attacks, or compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define attributes: Use the `attributes` method in serializers to explicitly list only the intended attributes for serialization. Avoid relying on default inclusions.
*   Use `except` or conditional logic: Employ the `except` option or conditional logic within serializers to exclude sensitive attributes based on context or user roles.
*   Regularly audit serializers: Review serializer configurations to ensure they align with the intended data exposure.
*   Implement attribute-level authorization: Consider using gems or custom logic to enforce authorization at the attribute level within serializers.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Related Model Data (Through Relationships)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_related_model_data__through_relationships_.md)

**Description:** Unintended exposure of data from related models due to improperly configured relationships in serializers.

**How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** AMS allows defining relationships (`has_many`, `belongs_to`) to include data from associated models. If the serializers for these related models are not carefully configured, they can expose more data than intended.

**Example:** A `PostSerializer` includes `belongs_to :author`. If the `AuthorSerializer` exposes sensitive information about the author, this information will be included in the `Post` API response.

**Impact:** Similar to over-serialization, this can lead to the leakage of sensitive data from related entities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure related serializers carefully: Ensure that serializers for related models only expose the necessary data.
*   Use `fields` or `embed :ids` for relationships: Instead of embedding full related objects, consider using `fields` to select specific attributes or `embed :ids` to only include IDs, requiring a separate request for full details.
*   Context-dependent relationship serialization:  Dynamically adjust the serialization of related models based on the context of the request or user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializer Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializer_logic.md)

**Description:** Security flaws introduced through custom methods or logic implemented within serializers.

**How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** AMS allows developers to define custom methods within serializers to manipulate or add data. If these methods are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom method in a serializer might fetch data from an external source without proper input validation, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Impact:** Can range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat serializer logic as security-sensitive code: Apply the same secure coding practices as you would for controllers or models.
*   Validate and sanitize input: If custom methods rely on external input, ensure it is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
*   Avoid complex logic in serializers: Keep serializer logic focused on data transformation and presentation. Move complex business logic to service objects or models.
*   Regularly review custom serializer code: Conduct code reviews to identify potential security flaws in custom methods.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Adapter Implementations (If Using Custom Adapters)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_adapter_implementations__if_using_custom_adapters_.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in custom or less common adapter implementations used by AMS.

**How Active Model Serializers Contributes:** AMS uses adapters to format the serialized output (e.g., JSON API, JSON). If a custom adapter is used, its implementation might contain security flaws.

**Example:** A custom XML adapter might be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection if it doesn't properly handle external entities.

**Impact:** Can lead to information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service, depending on the adapter vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prefer well-established and maintained adapters: Stick to widely used and actively maintained adapters like the default JSON adapter or the JSON API adapter.
*   Thoroughly vet custom adapters: If using a custom adapter, ensure it has undergone a thorough security review and follows secure coding practices.
*   Keep adapters up to date: If using a third-party adapter, ensure it is updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
