# Attack Tree Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **Compromise Application via Active Model Serializers [CRITICAL]**
    * **Exploit Insecure Serialization Configuration [CRITICAL]**
        * Improper Attribute Filtering --> Expose Sensitive Attributes --> **Gain Access to Confidential Data [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializer Logic [CRITICAL]**
        * Information Disclosure in Custom Methods --> **Expose Sensitive Data through Custom Logic [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
        * Code Injection in Custom Methods --> **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]**
    * Abuse Include Functionality
        * Unauthorized Data Access via Includes --> **Access Data from Associations the User Should Not See [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
    * Exploit Versioning Issues/Deprecated Features --> Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Specific AMS Versions
        --> Exploit Identified Security Flaws --> **Gain Unauthorized Access or Control [CRITICAL]**
    * Exploit Interaction with Underlying Models (Indirectly through AMS) --> Leverage Model Vulnerabilities Exposed by AMS
        --> Trigger Model Logic that Leads to Compromise
            --> Privilege Escalation (if model logic handles authorization) --> **Gain Unauthorized Access or Control [CRITICAL]**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Attribute Filtering --> Expose Sensitive Attributes --> Gain Access to Confidential Data](./attack_tree_paths/improper_attribute_filtering_--_expose_sensitive_attributes_--_gain_access_to_confidential_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers fail to explicitly exclude sensitive attributes in their Active Model Serializers.

**Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts API requests and examines the responses. Due to the misconfiguration, sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or internal identifiers are included in the serialized output.

**Underlying Vulnerability:** Lack of proper attribute filtering in the serializer definition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure in Custom Methods --> Expose Sensitive Data through Custom Logic](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_in_custom_methods_--_expose_sensitive_data_through_custom_logic.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom methods within their serializers that inadvertently expose sensitive information.

**Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies API endpoints that utilize serializers with vulnerable custom methods. The attacker crafts requests to trigger these methods, leading to the inclusion of sensitive data in the API response.

**Underlying Vulnerability:** Insecure logic or data access within custom serializer methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Data Access via Includes --> Access Data from Associations the User Should Not See](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_data_access_via_includes_--_access_data_from_associations_the_user_should_not_see.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses the `include` functionality of Active Model Serializers to load associated data, but lacks proper authorization checks on these associations.

**Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the `include` parameter in API requests to request associations they should not have access to. Due to the missing authorization checks, the application loads and serializes this data, exposing it to the attacker.

**Underlying Vulnerability:** Missing or insufficient authorization checks when loading associated resources via the `include` mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Active Model Serializers](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_active_model_serializers.md)

**Significance:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved a significant breach of the application's security.

**Consequences:**  Can lead to data breaches, service disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Serialization Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_serialization_configuration.md)

**Significance:** This node represents a fundamental flaw in how data is exposed by the application. It's a gateway to multiple high-risk paths.

**Consequences:**  Direct exposure of sensitive data, unintended data disclosure, and potential for client-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Confidential Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_confidential_data.md)

**Significance:** A direct and highly damaging outcome where the attacker obtains sensitive information.

**Consequences:**  Identity theft, financial fraud, unauthorized access to systems, and privacy violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializer Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializer_logic.md)

**Significance:** Custom logic introduces complexity and potential for security flaws. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to significant compromise.

**Consequences:** Information disclosure, data manipulation, and in the worst case, arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server.md)

**Significance:** The most severe form of compromise, granting the attacker complete control over the server.

**Consequences:**  Full system takeover, data destruction, installation of malware, and use of the server for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Data from Associations the User Should Not See](./attack_tree_paths/access_data_from_associations_the_user_should_not_see.md)

**Significance:** A direct violation of data privacy and security, indicating a failure in access control.

**Consequences:** Exposure of sensitive information belonging to other users or restricted parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access or Control](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_or_control.md)

**Significance:** Represents a breach of the application's security perimeter, allowing the attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do.

**Consequences:**  Data manipulation, privilege escalation, access to restricted resources, and potential for further compromise.
