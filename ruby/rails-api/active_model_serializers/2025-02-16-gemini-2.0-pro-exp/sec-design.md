# Project Design Document: Active Model Serializers

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Active Model Serializers (AMS) is a Ruby on Rails library that provides a convention-over-configuration approach to generating JSON responses from Rails models. It simplifies the process of serializing model data, including attributes and relationships, into a format suitable for API consumption.

Priorities:

- Maintainability: AMS is a mature project, and ensuring its continued maintainability is crucial. This includes keeping dependencies up-to-date, addressing reported issues, and ensuring compatibility with newer Rails versions.
- Ease of Use: A primary goal is to provide a simple and intuitive API for developers to serialize their models.
- Performance: Serialization can be a performance bottleneck, so optimizing for speed is important.
- Community Engagement: Maintaining an active and engaged community is vital for the long-term health of the project.
- Flexibility: While convention-over-configuration is a core principle, providing sufficient flexibility for customization is important.

Business Goals:

- Provide a reliable and efficient way for Rails developers to generate JSON responses.
- Reduce boilerplate code associated with JSON serialization.
- Promote consistency in API design across Rails projects.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Security Vulnerabilities: Serialization libraries can be potential targets for attacks, such as object injection or data leakage.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient serialization can negatively impact API response times.
- Compatibility Issues: Incompatibility with newer Rails versions or other dependencies can break existing applications.
- Lack of Maintenance: If the project is not actively maintained, it can become outdated and unusable.
- Community Fragmentation: A decline in community engagement can lead to fewer contributions and slower issue resolution.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Regular dependency updates: The project uses tools like Dependabot to keep dependencies up-to-date, mitigating known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Implemented in GitHub repository configuration).
- security control: Code Reviews: All contributions go through a code review process, helping to identify potential security issues before they are merged. (Implemented as a standard practice in the project's contribution guidelines).
- security control: Automated Testing: The project has a comprehensive test suite, which helps to prevent regressions and ensure that security-related features function as expected. (Implemented in the `test` directory of the repository).
- security control: Escaping: AMS likely uses Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when rendering JSON. (Implicitly handled by Rails).

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Potential for unknown vulnerabilities: Like any software, AMS may contain unknown vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies: The project depends on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could impact AMS.
- accepted risk: Limited control over user input: While AMS handles serialization, it relies on the application to properly validate and sanitize user input before it reaches the serialization layer.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP): While AMS itself doesn't directly handle HTTP responses, recommending the use of CSP in applications using AMS can mitigate XSS risks.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits: Periodic security audits, including penetration testing, can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Consider using a static analysis security tool (SAST): Integrating a SAST tool into the CI/CD pipeline can help detect potential security issues early in the development process.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to AMS, as it's a serialization library. Authentication should be handled at the application level.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to AMS. Authorization should be handled at the application level, controlling which resources a user can access. AMS should only serialize data that the user is authorized to see.
- Input Validation: While AMS doesn't directly handle user input, it's crucial that applications using AMS properly validate and sanitize all input before it's used to query models or passed to serializers. This prevents injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to AMS in most cases. If sensitive data needs to be encrypted, it should be handled at the application or database level before serialization. AMS should serialize the encrypted data, not perform the encryption itself.

### BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Pushes code" --> GitRepo["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepo -- "Webhook Trigger" --> CI["CI Server (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Runs Tests" --> TestSuite["Test Suite"]
    CI -- "Builds Gem" --> Build["Build Process"]
    Build -- "Publishes Gem" --> GemRepo["Gem Repository (RubyGems)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A webhook triggers the CI server (GitHub Actions in this case).
3.  The CI server checks out the code and runs the test suite.
4.  If the tests pass, the CI server builds the Ruby gem. This typically involves running `gem build active_model_serializers.gemspec`.
5.  The built gem is then published to the RubyGems repository using `gem push`.

Security Controls:

- security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed before being merged.
- security control: Automated Testing: The test suite is run automatically on every build.
- security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed using Bundler, and tools like Dependabot are used to keep them up-to-date.
- security control: Secure Credentials: API keys and other secrets used for publishing the gem are stored securely (e.g., using GitHub Actions secrets).
- security control: Static Analysis: Linters and static analysis tools (e.g., RuboCop) can be integrated into the build process to identify potential code quality and security issues.
- security control: Supply Chain Security: Consider using tools to verify the integrity of dependencies and prevent supply chain attacks.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- API Response Generation: The core function of AMS is to generate JSON responses for API requests. Any disruption to this process would directly impact the functionality of applications using the library.
- Data Serialization: AMS handles the serialization of model data. Errors or vulnerabilities in this process could lead to data corruption, leakage, or other security issues.

Data Sensitivity:

- The sensitivity of the data handled by AMS depends entirely on the application using it. AMS itself doesn't define the data it serializes.
- Applications using AMS may handle a wide range of data, from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
- The application using AMS is responsible for classifying and protecting data appropriately. AMS should be treated as a component that handles potentially sensitive data, and appropriate security measures should be applied at the application level.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific types of data will be serialized by applications using AMS? (This is crucial for determining the appropriate security measures.)
- What are the performance requirements for API responses? (This will influence the optimization strategies for AMS.)
- What is the expected level of customization required by users of AMS? (This will help determine the balance between convention-over-configuration and flexibility.)
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The project is actively maintained and has a responsive community.
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary use case is for generating JSON APIs for Rails applications.
