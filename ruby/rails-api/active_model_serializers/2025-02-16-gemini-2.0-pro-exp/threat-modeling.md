# Threat Model Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Default Attribute Inclusion](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_default_attribute_inclusion.md)

**1. Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure via Default Attribute Inclusion**

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a standard request to an API endpoint. The serializer, due to implicit attribute inclusion (not explicitly defining `attributes`), returns all model attributes, including sensitive ones like `password_digest`, `api_key`, `is_admin`, internal IDs, or other private data not intended for public consumption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Leakage of sensitive user data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial fraud, or account compromise.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Exposure of `is_admin` or similar flags could allow an attacker to identify administrative accounts.
    *   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Exposure of internal business logic or proprietary data.
*   **Affected Component:** The core serialization process when `attributes` are not explicitly defined in the serializer class. This affects the `ActiveModel::Serializer` base class and any subclasses that inherit this behavior. Specifically, the implicit attribute selection mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit `attributes` Declaration:** *Always* explicitly list the attributes to be serialized using `attributes :id, :name, :public_field, ...`. Never rely on the default behavior.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandate code reviews that specifically check serializers for explicit attribute definitions.
    *   **Automated Testing:** Include tests that verify the JSON output of serializers, ensuring only expected attributes are present.
    *   **Security Linters:** Use security-focused linters that can detect implicit attribute inclusion in serializers.

## Threat: [Over-Exposure of Associated Data](./threats/over-exposure_of_associated_data.md)

**2. Threat: Over-Exposure of Associated Data**

*   **Description:** An attacker requests a resource, and the serializer includes deeply nested associations (e.g., `User` includes `Posts`, which includes `Comments`, which includes `Commenters`). The attacker receives a large JSON payload containing sensitive data from related models that they should not have access to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Leakage of sensitive data from associated records.
    *   **Performance Degradation/DoS:** Excessive data retrieval can slow down the API or even lead to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of the relationship graph, revealing connections between users or data that should be private.
*   **Affected Component:** The association handling within serializers (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`). The way these associations are included and how their own serializers are configured.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Selective Association Inclusion:** Only include associations that are absolutely necessary for the specific API endpoint and user role.
    *   **Separate Serializers:** Create different serializers for different contexts (e.g., `PublicPostSerializer` vs. `AdminPostSerializer`).
    *   **Pagination:** *Always* paginate associated records to limit the amount of data returned.
    *   **`include` Option Control:** Carefully manage the `include` option in controllers to prevent overriding serializer settings and causing unintended data exposure.
    *   **Depth Limiting:** Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the depth of nested associations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Deeply Nested Associations](./threats/denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_associations.md)

**3. Threat: Denial of Service via Deeply Nested Associations**

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that triggers the serialization of deeply nested associations. This causes a large number of database queries (N+1 problem), potentially overwhelming the database server and leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Service Unavailability:** The API becomes unresponsive, affecting legitimate users.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Database server resources (CPU, memory, connections) are exhausted.
*   **Affected Component:** The association handling within serializers (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`), particularly when nested deeply and without proper eager loading or pagination.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Association Depth:** Avoid deeply nested associations in serializers.
    *   **Eager Loading:** Use `includes`, `preload`, or `eager_load` in controllers to efficiently load associated data.
    *   **Pagination:** Paginate associated records to limit the amount of data retrieved.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor database query performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
