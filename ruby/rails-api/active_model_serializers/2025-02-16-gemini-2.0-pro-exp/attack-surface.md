# Attack Surface Analysis for rails-api/active_model_serializers

## Attack Surface: [Data Over-Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./attack_surfaces/data_over-exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional leakage of sensitive data through API responses.
*   **AMS Contribution:** AMS can serialize all model attributes by default, or include excessive data through nested associations if not configured carefully. This is a *direct* consequence of how AMS functions.
*   **Example:** A `User` model with a `password_digest` attribute is serialized without an explicit serializer, exposing the hashed password to the client.  Or, a `Post` serializer includes the `User` association, which in turn includes all the user's private profile information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (passwords, PII, internal IDs, etc.), leading to potential account compromise, privacy violations, or further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if sensitive data like credentials are exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Serializers:** Always define explicit serializers for each model.
    *   **Attribute Whitelisting:** Use the `attributes` method within the serializer to *explicitly* list only the necessary attributes.
    *   **Controlled Nesting:** Limit the depth of nested associations. Use separate serializers for nested objects and whitelist their attributes.
    *   **`include: false`:** Use `include: false` or carefully manage the `include` option to prevent unintended inclusion of associations.
    *   **Regular Reviews:** Regularly review serializers to ensure they remain up-to-date and don't expose new sensitive data as the model evolves.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Serialization](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_serialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that trigger the serialization of extremely large or complex object graphs, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **AMS Contribution:** Deeply nested associations, a *direct* feature of AMS, can be exploited to create excessively large responses.
*   **Example:** An attacker requests a resource with deeply nested associations (e.g., `users?include=posts.comments.author.posts.comments...`).
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, affecting legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Nesting Depth:** Strictly limit the depth of nested associations allowed in serializers.
    *   **Pagination:** Implement pagination to limit the number of records returned in a single response.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from making an excessive number of requests.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set resource limits (memory, CPU) on the application server to prevent exhaustion.
    * **Batch Processing:** Use techniques like `ActiveRecord::Batches` to process large datasets in smaller chunks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization (Direct if misused)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization__direct_if_misused_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from deserializing untrusted data, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **AMS Contribution:** While AMS focuses on *serialization*, if it's *directly* used (misused) to deserialize untrusted input into model objects without proper validation, it becomes a direct vulnerability. This is a less common use case, but a critical risk if present.
*   **Example:** An application accepts a JSON payload from an untrusted source and *directly* uses AMS to deserialize it into model objects without any validation or sanitization. This is different from the "indirect" case where AMS is used *after* strong parameters.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, or other severe consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization with AMS:** Do *not* directly use AMS to deserialize untrusted data into model objects.
    *   **Safe Deserialization:** If deserialization is necessary, use a safe deserialization library or mechanism that prevents arbitrary code execution.  This would *not* be AMS.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data *before* attempting to use it, regardless of the deserialization method.
