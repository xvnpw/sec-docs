## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Active Model Serializers](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_active_model_serializers.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker.
* It is critical because success means full or partial compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [AND] [CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Data Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___and___critical_node__gain_unauthorized_data_access__high-risk_path_.md)

* This is a critical node because unauthorized data access is a primary goal for many attackers and a significant security breach.
* It is a high-risk path because misconfigurations and insecure custom logic in serializers are common and easily exploitable.
* Attack Vectors within this path:
    * Exploit Misconfiguration
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMS Library Itself (Lower Risk, not in sub-tree)
    * Abuse Custom Serializer Logic

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [OR] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3___or___critical_node__exploit_misconfiguration__high-risk_path_.md)

* This is a critical node because misconfigurations are the most likely and easily exploitable vulnerabilities in AMS usage.
* It is a high-risk path due to the high likelihood and relatively low effort required to exploit misconfigurations.
* Attack Vectors within this path:
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Over-serialization of Sensitive Data**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Attributes**
            * **Attack Vector:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive attributes in serializers by failing to explicitly exclude them.
            * **Likelihood:** High
            * **Impact:** High (Sensitive Data Exposure)
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Incorrect Association Serialization**
            * **Attack Vector:** Serializing related models without proper filtering, leading to exposure of unintended data, especially through deeply nested associations.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Medium-High (Potentially Sensitive Data Exposure, more complex data)
            * **Effort:** Low-Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Default Serializer Misuse**
            * **Attack Vector:** Relying on default serializers that expose more data than intended, instead of explicitly defining serializers.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Medium (Potentially Sensitive Data Exposure)
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Bypass Authorization Checks in Serializers**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of Authorization Logic in Custom Serializers**
            * **Attack Vector:** Custom serializers fail to implement proper authorization checks for attributes or associations, leading to unauthorized data access.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Medium-High (Unauthorized Access to Data)
            * **Effort:** Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
    * Information Leakage via Debugging/Error Messages (Lower Risk, not in sub-tree)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [OR] Abuse Custom Serializer Logic](./attack_tree_paths/4___or__abuse_custom_serializer_logic.md)

* This is a higher-level node representing vulnerabilities introduced through custom serializer implementations.
* Attack Vectors within this path:
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Custom Attributes/Methods**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Custom attributes fetch data without proper authorization.**
            * **Attack Vector:** Custom attributes in serializers directly access data without proper authorization checks, bypassing application-level security.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Medium-High (Unauthorized Access to Data, potential for manipulation if logic is complex)
            * **Effort:** Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Custom methods in serializers bypass application-level authorization.**
            * **Attack Vector:** Custom methods in serializers bypass application-level authorization mechanisms, leading to unauthorized data access.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Medium-High (Unauthorized Access to Data, potential for manipulation if logic is complex)
            * **Effort:** Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
    * Logic flaws in custom attribute/method implementation (Lower Risk, not in sub-tree)
    * Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Logic (Very Low Risk, not in sub-tree)

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [AND] Gain Unauthorized Data Manipulation (Less Direct via AMS, but possible consequence)](./attack_tree_paths/5___and__gain_unauthorized_data_manipulation__less_direct_via_ams__but_possible_consequence_.md)

* This node represents the potential for data manipulation as a consequence of data exposure through AMS.
* It is linked with "Gain Unauthorized Data Access" because data manipulation is often a secondary goal after gaining unauthorized access.
* Attack Vectors within this path:
    * **[OR] [CRITICAL NODE] Indirect Manipulation via Data Exposure [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exposed Sensitive Data Leads to Account Takeover**
            * **Attack Vector:** Leaked credentials or personal information via AMS misconfigurations are used for account takeover.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium (If sensitive data is exposed via misconfiguration)
            * **Impact:** High (Account Takeover, data breach)
            * **Effort:** Low-Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        * Exposed Business Logic Leads to Exploitation (Lower Risk, not in sub-tree)
    * Direct Manipulation via AMS Vulnerabilities (Very Very Low Risk, not in sub-tree)
