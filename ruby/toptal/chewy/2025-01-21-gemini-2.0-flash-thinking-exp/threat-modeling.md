# Threat Model Analysis for toptal/chewy

## Threat: [Insecure Elasticsearch Credentials in Chewy Configuration](./threats/insecure_elasticsearch_credentials_in_chewy_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in the application or gain unauthorized access to the server's file system to read configuration files where Elasticsearch credentials are stored in plain text or easily reversible formats. They could then use these credentials to directly access and manipulate the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch, data breaches, data manipulation (deletion, modification), denial of service by disrupting the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Chewy Configuration (e.g., `Chewy.config`, initializer files).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize secure credential management practices such as environment variable encryption (e.g., using `dotenv-vault`), secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in code or version control.
*   Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Chewy Indices and Types Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/misconfigured_chewy_indices_and_types_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or gaining unauthorized access to Elasticsearch, could leverage overly permissive index mappings or a lack of field-level security in Chewy-managed indices to access data they should not be able to see.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privacy violations, potential compliance breaches.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Chewy Index Definition (`Chewy::Index`), Type Definition (`Chewy::Type`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully define index mappings, explicitly setting `enabled: false` for fields that should not be searchable or retrievable.
*   Utilize Elasticsearch's security features (e.g., field-level access control) if necessary.
*   Regularly review and audit Chewy index and type definitions.

## Threat: [Injection Attacks via Unsanitized Data in Chewy Indexing Callbacks](./threats/injection_attacks_via_unsanitized_data_in_chewy_indexing_callbacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate data that is processed by custom logic within Chewy's indexing callbacks or strategies. If this logic constructs Elasticsearch queries or performs other actions based on this data without proper sanitization, it could lead to Elasticsearch query injection or other unintended consequences.

**Impact:** Data corruption in Elasticsearch, denial of service on the Elasticsearch cluster, potential for remote code execution if the Elasticsearch setup is vulnerable.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Chewy Indexing Callbacks (`#before_save`, `#after_save`, etc.), Custom Indexing Strategies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all external data before using it in indexing logic.
*   Avoid constructing raw Elasticsearch queries within callbacks if possible; utilize Chewy's DSL.
*   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom indexing logic.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection via Improper Use of Chewy's DSL](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection_via_improper_use_of_chewy's_dsl.md)

**Description:** While Chewy's DSL aims to abstract away raw Elasticsearch queries, developers might still inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by directly embedding unsanitized user input into query clauses when building search queries using the DSL.

**Impact:**  Bypassing access controls, retrieving sensitive data, potentially impacting Elasticsearch cluster performance.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Chewy's Search DSL (`Chewy::Query`, `Chewy::Type.search`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always sanitize and validate user input used in search queries.
*   Utilize parameterized queries or the more structured parts of Chewy's DSL to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into query clauses.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when constructing search queries.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Unrestricted Search Results](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_unrestricted_search_results.md)

**Description:** If Chewy indices contain sensitive data and search queries are not properly restricted based on user permissions, an attacker could potentially retrieve data they are not authorized to access through search results.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, data breaches, privacy violations.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Chewy's Search DSL, application logic interacting with search results.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement proper authorization and access control mechanisms at the application level to filter search results based on user roles and permissions.
*   Avoid indexing sensitive data that is not necessary for search functionality.
*   Consider using Elasticsearch's security features for document-level security if needed.

## Threat: [Using an Outdated Version of Chewy with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_an_outdated_version_of_chewy_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker might target known vulnerabilities present in older versions of the Chewy gem.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the application or the underlying Elasticsearch infrastructure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Chewy Component:** The entire Chewy gem.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Chewy updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor Chewy's release notes and security advisories for updates and patches.
*   Have a process for regularly updating dependencies.
