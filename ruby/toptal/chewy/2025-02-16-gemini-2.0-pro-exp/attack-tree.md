## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Data Access/Modification (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_data_accessmodification__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical branch, focusing on attacks that directly compromise data confidentiality and integrity. The attacker aims to read, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Index Corruption (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_index_corruption__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker attempts to corrupt the Elasticsearch index, leading to incorrect search results, data loss, or potential data leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Manipulate Indexing Logic](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_manipulate_indexing_logic.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code responsible for preparing data for indexing by Chewy. This could involve injecting malicious data or manipulating the indexing process to control how data is stored and retrieved.
*   *Likelihood:* Medium
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* Medium
*   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exploit Chewy's Update Strategies](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_chewy's_update_strategies.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker leverages a vulnerability within Chewy's update strategies (e.g., `atomic`, `bulk`) to corrupt the index. This is less likely if Chewy is well-maintained and the correct strategy is used appropriately.
*   *Likelihood:* Low
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* High
*   *Skill Level:* Advanced
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Abuse Update Strategies](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_abuse_update_strategies.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker exploits flaws in the application's logic surrounding Chewy's update features.  They might use legitimate Chewy update calls, but in a way that violates the application's intended authorization rules, leading to unauthorized data modification.
*   *Likelihood:* Medium
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* Medium
*   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Bypass Chewy's Access Controls (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_bypass_chewy's_access_controls__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker attempts to circumvent any filtering or access controls implemented using Chewy, gaining access to data they should not be able to see.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Craft Queries Bypassing Filters (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_craft_queries_bypassing_filters__high-risk_path_.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker crafts specific search queries that exploit weaknesses in the application's Chewy filters. This could involve using unexpected input, exploiting logical flaws in the filter definitions, or leveraging edge cases.
*   *Likelihood:* Medium
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* Medium
*   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Exploit Flaws in Filters](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_exploit_flaws_in_filters.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker exploits a vulnerability within Chewy's filtering mechanism itself. This is less likely if Chewy is well-maintained and regularly updated.
*   *Likelihood:* Low
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* High
*   *Skill Level:* Advanced
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Manipulate Query Composition](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_manipulate_query_composition.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker manipulates how the application constructs Chewy queries. If the application dynamically builds queries based on user input without proper sanitization, the attacker might be able to inject malicious query components.
*   *Likelihood:* Medium
*   *Impact:* High
*   *Effort:* Low
*   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Inject Malicious Queries (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_inject_malicious_queries__critical_node_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical attack vector. The attacker successfully injects malicious code into the Elasticsearch query, potentially gaining complete control over the search functionality and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Inject Elasticsearch Query DSL (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_inject_elasticsearch_query_dsl__high-risk_path_.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker injects raw Elasticsearch Query DSL code into the application. This is typically possible if the application directly uses user input to construct queries without proper validation or parameterization. This gives the attacker complete control over what Elasticsearch executes.
*   *Likelihood:* Low (if best practices are followed)
*   *Impact:* Very High
*   *Effort:* Low (if direct concatenation is used)
*   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Inject Scripting in Queries](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_inject_scripting_in_queries.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker injects malicious scripts into Elasticsearch queries. Elasticsearch supports scripting, which can be very powerful but also dangerous if misused. This attack requires that scripting is enabled and not properly secured.
*   *Likelihood:* Low
*   *Impact:* Very High
*   *Effort:* Medium
*   *Skill Level:* Advanced
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch via Chewy](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch_via_chewy.md)

*   *Description:* The attacker exploits a vulnerability in Elasticsearch itself, using Chewy as the conduit for the attack. This requires a known or zero-day vulnerability in Elasticsearch.
*   *Likelihood:* Low
*   *Impact:* Very High
*   *Effort:* High
*   *Skill Level:* Expert
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
