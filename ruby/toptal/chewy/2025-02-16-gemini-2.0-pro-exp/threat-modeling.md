# Threat Model Analysis for toptal/chewy

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure via Indexing](./threats/threat_sensitive_data_exposure_via_indexing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive data unintentionally indexed in Elasticsearch. This occurs because developers index entire model objects without carefully selecting fields or fail to transform sensitive data before indexing. The attacker uses Elasticsearch queries or exploits API vulnerabilities to retrieve this data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Leakage of confidential information (PII, financial data, internal documents).
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Legal and regulatory penalties.
    *   Loss of user trust.
*   **Chewy Component Affected:**
    *   Index definition (`Chewy::Index` subclasses).
    *   `field` method within index definitions.
    *   `update_index` and related methods that trigger indexing.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Field Selection:** Use the `field` method to *explicitly* list only necessary fields for indexing. Do *not* index entire objects.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Hash, encrypt, or redact sensitive fields *before* indexing.
    *   **Elasticsearch Access Control:** Implement strict access control within Elasticsearch (roles, users, permissions).
    *   **Regular Audits:** Review index definitions and Elasticsearch data regularly.

## Threat: [Threat: Elasticsearch Query Injection](./threats/threat_elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that's directly incorporated into an Elasticsearch query without sanitization. This manipulates query logic, bypassing security filters, accessing unauthorized data, or potentially executing arbitrary code within the Elasticsearch cluster (depending on configuration and vulnerabilities). This is most likely with raw query strings constructed using user input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potential for remote code execution (RCE) within the Elasticsearch cluster (severe cases, configuration-dependent).
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Chewy Component Affected:**
    *   Methods accepting user input and using it for queries, especially `Chewy::Query#query` with raw strings.
    *   Methods building queries dynamically from user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Chewy's DSL:** *Always* prefer Chewy's query DSL methods (`query`, `filter`, `term`, `match`) over raw query strings.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user input before use in *any* query part, even with the DSL.
    *   **Avoid Raw Queries:** Minimize/eliminate raw Elasticsearch queries passed to Chewy.
    *   **Least Privilege (Elasticsearch):** Grant the application's Elasticsearch user only minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends many complex/inefficient search requests, overwhelming the Elasticsearch cluster. This can be through malicious queries or exploiting poorly optimized Chewy queries. The attacker aims to consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O, making Elasticsearch unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Search functionality unavailable.
    *   Potential cascading failures if other application parts depend on Elasticsearch.
    *   Application downtime.
*   **Chewy Component Affected:**
    *   Methods executing Elasticsearch queries, especially those handling user search requests.
    *   `Chewy::Query` and its methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Optimization:** Design efficient Chewy queries. Use appropriate filters, aggregations, and sorting. Profile queries.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on search requests.
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for Elasticsearch queries.
    *   **Elasticsearch Cluster Monitoring:** Monitor cluster resource usage; set alerts for high load.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Temporarily disable search if the cluster is overloaded.

## Threat: [Threat: Index Corruption or Deletion](./threats/threat_index_corruption_or_deletion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or a bug in application code, accidentally/intentionally deletes or corrupts Elasticsearch indices. This could be due to direct access to Elasticsearch with elevated privileges, or flaws in Chewy integration allowing unintended index manipulation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete loss of search functionality.
    *   Data loss (if backups are unavailable/outdated).
    *   Application downtime.
*   **Chewy Component Affected:**
    *   `Chewy::Index.reset!` and `Chewy::Index.delete`.
    *   Code interacting with index creation, deletion, or updating.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Backups:** Implement regular, automated backups.
    *   **Strict Access Control (Elasticsearch):** Limit write/delete permissions to authorized users/applications.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code interacting with Chewy's index management.
    *   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing, including integration tests, for index operations.

## Threat: [Threat: Vulnerabilities in Chewy or Dependencies](./threats/threat_vulnerabilities_in_chewy_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered in the Chewy gem itself or in one of its dependencies (e.g., the Elasticsearch client library). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from data breaches to remote code execution.
*   **Chewy Component Affected:**
    *   Potentially any part of the Chewy gem or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability) - Potentially Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Chewy and all its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Chewy, Elasticsearch, and related libraries.
