# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the 'chewy' GitHub repository, aims to provide a Ruby library that simplifies the integration of Elasticsearch into Ruby applications. The primary business goal is to enhance the development experience for Ruby developers working with Elasticsearch, enabling them to build efficient and robust search and data indexing functionalities more easily. This can lead to faster development cycles, reduced development costs, and improved application performance related to search and data retrieval.

From a business perspective, the priorities are:

- Developer productivity: Streamlining the process of working with Elasticsearch in Ruby.
- Application performance: Enabling efficient search and data indexing within Ruby applications.
- Maintainability: Providing a well-structured and easy-to-maintain abstraction layer.
- Community adoption: Encouraging widespread use within the Ruby developer community.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Security vulnerabilities in the library itself could be exploited by applications using it, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
- Inefficient or incorrect usage of the library by developers could lead to performance issues or data integrity problems in applications.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable over time.
- Compatibility issues with different versions of Elasticsearch or Ruby could hinder adoption and cause integration problems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Open-source license (MIT License), allowing for community review and contribution. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)
- security control: Dependency management using Bundler and gemspec, allowing for tracking and management of external dependencies. (Implemented: Gemfile and .gemspec file in repository)

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (gems) which may have their own vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Security of applications using 'chewy' is the responsibility of the application developers, not the library itself.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced in future updates or contributions.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in gem dependencies.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for new features and contributions.
- security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure usage of the library, including input validation and sanitization when interacting with Elasticsearch.
- security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is handled by the applications using 'chewy' and Elasticsearch itself.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is handled by the applications using 'chewy' and Elasticsearch itself.
- Input validation: While 'chewy' itself doesn't directly handle user input, it's crucial that applications using 'chewy' properly validate and sanitize any user input before using it in Elasticsearch queries or index operations. 'chewy' should encourage and facilitate secure practices in its documentation and examples.
- Cryptography: 'chewy' might interact with sensitive data indexed in Elasticsearch. While 'chewy' itself might not implement cryptography, it should support and encourage the use of encrypted connections to Elasticsearch (HTTPS) and the proper handling of sensitive data within applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process:

- Enabling search functionality in Ruby applications. This is critical for applications where users need to find information quickly and efficiently. Disruption or compromise of this functionality can negatively impact user experience and business operations.

Data we are trying to protect:

- Data indexed in Elasticsearch: The 'chewy' gem is used to manage data that is indexed and stored in Elasticsearch. The sensitivity of this data depends on the applications using 'chewy'. It could range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
- Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the data is application-dependent. For applications handling user data, the data indexed in Elasticsearch could be highly sensitive (e.g., user profiles, transaction history, personal information). For other applications, it might be less sensitive (e.g., product catalogs, public website content). It is crucial to understand the data sensitivity in the context of each application using 'chewy'.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
