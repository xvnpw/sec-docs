# Threat Model Analysis for toptal/chewy

## Threat: [Data Injection/Tampering during Indexing](./threats/data_injectiontampering_during_indexing.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could manipulate data during the indexing process by exploiting flaws in Chewy strategies or data transformation logic. This could involve injecting malicious scripts or altering data integrity. For example, by submitting crafted data to application endpoints that are subsequently indexed by Chewy.
* **Impact:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities in search results, data corruption in Elasticsearch, potential for further exploitation if injected data is processed by other application components.
* **Affected Chewy Component:** Index Strategies, Data Transformation Logic within Strategies.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization in Chewy index strategies.
    * Use output encoding when displaying search results to prevent XSS.
    * Regularly review and test data transformation logic for vulnerabilities.
    * Apply principle of least privilege to database access used by indexing processes.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Elasticsearch](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_elasticsearch.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive data if Chewy indexes data that should not be searchable or publicly accessible due to misconfigured index mappings. This could happen if developers inadvertently include sensitive fields in the indexed data through Chewy's configuration.
* **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage.
* **Affected Chewy Component:** Index Mappings, Index Configuration.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully design Chewy index mappings to only include necessary data.
    * Exclude sensitive data from indexing unless absolutely required and properly secured.
    * Implement strong access control mechanisms in Elasticsearch to restrict access to sensitive indices.
    * Regularly audit indexed data to ensure compliance with data privacy policies.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could inject malicious Elasticsearch query clauses if user input is directly incorporated into queries constructed by Chewy without proper sanitization. This could allow bypassing access controls or retrieving unauthorized data. For example, by manipulating search parameters in the application's search interface that are processed by Chewy.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation in Elasticsearch (in severe cases), potential for privilege escalation.
* **Affected Chewy Component:** Query Builder, Raw Query Functionality (if used directly).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Always use Chewy's query builder methods instead of raw query strings whenever possible.**
    * If raw queries are necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into the query.
    * Utilize parameterized queries if supported by Chewy and Elasticsearch.
    * Implement input validation on search parameters.

## Threat: [Insecure Elasticsearch Connection](./threats/insecure_elasticsearch_connection.md)

* **Description:** If the connection between Chewy and Elasticsearch, configured through Chewy, is not properly secured, communication could be intercepted or manipulated. This could happen if using HTTP instead of HTTPS or weak credentials in Chewy's Elasticsearch client configuration.
* **Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access to Elasticsearch, data breaches.
* **Affected Chewy Component:** Elasticsearch Client Configuration, Connection Settings within Chewy.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Always use HTTPS for communication between Chewy and Elasticsearch.**
    * Configure strong, unique credentials for Elasticsearch access within Chewy's configuration.
    * Use TLS/SSL certificates for encrypted communication.
    * Restrict network access to Elasticsearch to authorized application servers.

## Threat: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

* **Description:** If Elasticsearch credentials used by Chewy are hardcoded or stored insecurely in application configuration accessible to Chewy, they could be compromised, leading to unauthorized access to Elasticsearch. This could happen if credentials are in code, configuration files, or environment variables without proper protection when used by Chewy.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Elasticsearch, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
* **Affected Chewy Component:** Configuration Loading, Credential Management within Chewy's context.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Never hardcode Elasticsearch credentials in application code or configuration files used by Chewy.**
    * Use secure methods for storing and retrieving credentials, such as environment variables managed by a secure configuration management system or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), and ensure Chewy is configured to use these secure methods.
    * Restrict access to credential storage mechanisms.
