# Attack Surface Analysis for toptal/chewy

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Injection via Search Parameters](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_injection_via_search_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate user-provided input used to construct Elasticsearch queries, leading to unintended data access, modification, or denial-of-service within the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **How Chewy Contributes:** Chewy simplifies the process of building Elasticsearch queries in Ruby. If the application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into Chewy's query DSL (Domain Specific Language) or uses string-based queries with user input, it becomes vulnerable to injection.
    *   **Example:** An e-commerce application allows users to search for products. If the search term is directly inserted into a Chewy query like `Product.search(query: { match: { name: params[:q] } })`, an attacker could input something like `"}} OR _exists_:password OR {{"` to potentially bypass the intended search and retrieve products with a "password" field.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch.
        *   Modification or deletion of data within Elasticsearch.
        *   Denial-of-service by crafting resource-intensive queries that overload the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Parameterized Queries: Utilize Chewy's features that allow for parameterized queries, where user input is treated as data rather than code. This prevents the interpretation of malicious input as part of the query structure.
        *   Input Sanitization and Validation: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries. This includes escaping special characters and ensuring the input conforms to expected formats.
        *   Whitelisting Allowed Fields and Operators: If possible, limit the search functionality to specific fields and operators, preventing the use of potentially dangerous Elasticsearch features through user input.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege for Elasticsearch User: Ensure the Elasticsearch user the application connects with has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations, limiting the impact of a successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage or Exposure of Elasticsearch Connection Details](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_or_exposure_of_elasticsearch_connection_details.md)

*   **Description:** If the connection details for the Elasticsearch cluster (e.g., host, port, username, password) are stored insecurely or exposed, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch infrastructure.
    *   **How Chewy Contributes:** Chewy requires configuration to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster. If this configuration is hardcoded in the application, stored in version control without proper encryption, or exposed through insecure configuration files, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Elasticsearch connection details are directly written in a configuration file that is committed to a public Git repository.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service.
        *   Potential access to other applications or systems that share the same Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Environment Variables: Store sensitive Elasticsearch connection details as environment variables, which are not typically stored in version control and can be managed separately for different environments.
        *   Secure Configuration Management: Utilize secure configuration management tools or services that encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege for Elasticsearch Credentials: Ensure the credentials used by the application have the minimum necessary permissions on the Elasticsearch cluster.
        *   Avoid Hardcoding Credentials: Never hardcode sensitive credentials directly into the application code.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection During Indexing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_during_indexing.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows external users or untrusted sources to trigger data indexing into Elasticsearch via Chewy without proper authorization and validation, attackers can inject malicious data.
    *   **How Chewy Contributes:** Chewy provides the mechanisms for indexing data into Elasticsearch. If the application's logic around data ingestion and indexing doesn't implement sufficient security checks, Chewy can become a conduit for injecting malicious content.
    *   **Example:** A blogging platform uses Chewy to index blog posts. If a user can manipulate the data sent for indexing, they could inject malicious JavaScript into the post content, which could then be executed in other users' browsers when the post is displayed in search results.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if injected data is rendered in web applications.
        *   Data poisoning, corrupting the integrity of the indexed data.
        *   Potential for further exploitation depending on the nature of the injected data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data before indexing it into Elasticsearch. This includes escaping HTML and JavaScript for web applications.
        *   Authorization and Authentication: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users or systems can trigger indexing operations.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong Content Security Policy in web applications to mitigate the impact of injected XSS payloads.
        *   Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit the data indexing process to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
