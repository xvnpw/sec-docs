# Threat Model Analysis for toptal/chewy

## Threat: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials in Chewy Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_elasticsearch_credentials_in_chewy_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the Elasticsearch cluster credentials (hostname, port, username, password) if they are directly exposed through Chewy's configuration mechanisms. This includes hardcoding credentials in `chewy.yml` or initializers, or if Chewy's configuration logic does not properly handle secure credential retrieval from environment variables or other secure stores.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster. An attacker could read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Affected Chewy Component:** `Chewy::Config` module, configuration loading logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure Chewy to retrieve Elasticsearch credentials from secure environment variables or dedicated secret management systems.
*   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in Chewy configuration files.
*   Ensure that Chewy's configuration loading process is secure and does not inadvertently expose credentials.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Unsanitized Input during Chewy Indexing](./threats/data_injection_through_unsanitized_input_during_chewy_indexing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data into the Elasticsearch index by providing crafted input that bypasses sanitization checks *before* being passed to Chewy's indexing methods. The vulnerability lies in how the application interacts with Chewy's indexing API, allowing unsanitized data to be sent for indexing.

**Impact:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the injected data contains malicious scripts that are executed in users' browsers when the data is retrieved from Elasticsearch. Data corruption within the Elasticsearch index. Potential for further attacks if the injected data is used in other application processes.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Indexing methods within defined Chewy index classes, the interface through which the application sends data to Chewy for indexing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data *before* passing it to Chewy's indexing methods.
*   Use output encoding when displaying data retrieved from Elasticsearch to prevent XSS.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection through Malicious Search Parameters](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection_through_malicious_search_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious Elasticsearch queries by manipulating input parameters that are directly used by the application to build Elasticsearch queries *using Chewy's query DSL*. The vulnerability occurs when the application improperly constructs Chewy queries by directly incorporating unsanitized user input, allowing injection of arbitrary Elasticsearch query syntax.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data stored in Elasticsearch that the user should not have access to. Potential for data modification or deletion depending on Elasticsearch cluster configuration. Denial of Service (DoS) by crafting resource-intensive queries that overload the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Search methods provided by Chewy within defined Chewy index classes, application code constructing search queries using Chewy's DSL.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize parameterized queries or the query builder provided by Chewy's DSL to construct search queries, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input into query structures.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all search parameters *before* they are used to build Chewy queries.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Elasticsearch Indices due to Incorrect Mapping in Chewy](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_elasticsearch_indices_due_to_incorrect_mapping_in_chewy.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently index sensitive data into Elasticsearch due to an incorrect or overly broad index mapping configuration *defined within Chewy index classes*. This occurs when the Chewy mapping includes fields that expose sensitive information unnecessarily.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized users who might gain access to the Elasticsearch index or search results. Potential violation of data privacy regulations.

**Affected Chewy Component:** Index mapping definitions within Chewy index classes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully design and review the index mapping for each Chewy index, ensuring only necessary data is indexed.
*   Avoid including sensitive information in the Chewy index mapping unless absolutely required.
*   Consider using data masking or anonymization techniques *before* data is processed by Chewy for indexing.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication between Chewy and Elasticsearch](./threats/insecure_communication_between_chewy_and_elasticsearch.md)

**Description:** If Chewy is configured to communicate with Elasticsearch over an insecure protocol (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker could eavesdrop on the communication. This vulnerability lies within Chewy's transport layer configuration.

**Impact:** Exposure of Elasticsearch credentials transmitted between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster. Disclosure of sensitive data being indexed or queried through Chewy.

**Affected Chewy Component:** `Chewy::Transport::HTTP` or other transport layers used by Chewy to communicate with Elasticsearch, Chewy's configuration related to transport.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure Chewy to communicate with Elasticsearch exclusively over HTTPS/TLS.
*   Ensure that the Elasticsearch cluster is configured to enforce TLS/SSL connections.
*   Verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the Elasticsearch server in Chewy's configuration to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
