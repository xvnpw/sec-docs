# Attack Surface Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the way Discourse parses and renders user-provided Markdown can lead to the execution of malicious code or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse uses a custom Markdown parser. Bugs or oversights in this parser's code directly introduce the risk of improper rendering and potential exploitation.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a specific Markdown input that, when rendered by Discourse, executes arbitrary JavaScript in another user's browser (XSS).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to account takeover, data theft, or defacement.
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the parser can be tricked into making requests to internal resources.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) if specially crafted Markdown consumes excessive server resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous testing and security audits of the Discourse Markdown parser are essential. Implement robust input sanitization and contextual output encoding within the parser. Regularly review and update the parser logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Discourse's API can allow unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse's core functionality is exposed through its API. Flaws in the API's authentication, authorization mechanisms, or input validation within Discourse's codebase create these attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint designed for administrators lacks proper authentication checks in the Discourse backend, allowing any logged-in user to perform administrative actions by directly calling the API.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches through unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by Discourse.
        *   Account manipulation or takeover via API calls.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) by abusing API endpoints, potentially overwhelming Discourse resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the affected API endpoints and the level of access granted).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict and consistent authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints within the Discourse codebase. Perform thorough input validation and output encoding on all API request and response data. Enforce rate limiting at the API level within Discourse to prevent abuse. Regularly audit the API codebase for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Vulnerabilities (Focus on Discourse's Handling)](./attack_surfaces/webhook_vulnerabilities__focus_on_discourse's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Security issues related to *how Discourse handles* incoming webhook responses or how it allows configuration of outgoing webhooks can be exploited.
    *   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse's code is responsible for processing incoming webhook responses and for providing the interface to configure outgoing webhooks. Vulnerabilities in this code directly contribute to the risk.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in how Discourse processes the data received from a webhook allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the system. Or, the lack of proper validation on webhook URLs allows an administrator to configure a webhook pointing to an internal service, leading to SSRF.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if webhook configurations can be manipulated to target internal resources.
        *   Data manipulation or injection within the Discourse application itself through maliciously crafted webhook responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of data received from webhook responses within Discourse's code. Implement strict validation of webhook URLs to prevent targeting of internal resources.
        *   **Users/Admins:** Exercise caution when configuring webhooks, ensuring the receiving endpoints are trusted.
