    - User search queries are directed to Elasticsearch for efficient retrieval of results.

## 5. Data Flow

This section illustrates the typical flow of data for common user interactions within the Discourse platform.

### 5.1. User Login

- The user enters their credentials in the login form within their web browser.
- The browser sends an HTTPS POST request containing the credentials to the load balancer.
- The load balancer routes the request to one of the available web application servers.
- The web application server authenticates the user by comparing the provided credentials with the stored, hashed password in the PostgreSQL database.
- Upon successful authentication, the server creates a session and stores the session ID in the Redis cache.
- The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser, including a `Set-Cookie` header containing the session cookie.

### 5.2. Posting a New Topic

- The user composes a new topic using the editor in their web browser.
- The browser sends an AJAX POST request containing the topic title and content to the load balancer.
- The load balancer routes the request to a web application server.
- The web application server validates the input data.
- The server creates a new topic and the initial post in the PostgreSQL database.
- The server updates relevant caches in Redis (e.g., recent topics).
- The server queues background jobs using Sidekiq for sending notifications to subscribed users.
- The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser confirming the successful creation of the topic.

### 5.3. Viewing a Topic

- The user clicks on a link to a topic in their web browser.
- The browser sends an HTTPS GET request to the load balancer, specifying the topic ID.
- The load balancer routes the request to a web application server.
- The web application server retrieves the topic and its associated posts from the PostgreSQL database, potentially leveraging the Redis cache for frequently accessed data.
- The server renders the HTML for the topic page and sends it as an HTTP response to the browser.
- The browser then makes separate requests to the CDN for static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript).

### 5.4. Uploading an Avatar

- The user uploads an avatar image through a form in their web browser.
- The browser sends a multipart/form-data POST request to the load balancer.
- The load balancer routes the request to a web application server.
- The web application server receives the image data.
- The server uploads the image to the configured object storage (e.g., S3).
- The server updates the user's profile in the PostgreSQL database with the URL of the uploaded avatar in object storage.
- The server updates relevant caches in Redis.
- The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser confirming the successful upload.

    - Implementing fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
- **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    - Thoroughly validating all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)).
    - Encoding output data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
    - Implementing CSRF tokens to prevent malicious requests originating from other websites.
- **Session Management:**
    - Securely managing user sessions using HTTP cookies with appropriate flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
    - Implementing session timeouts and invalidation mechanisms.
- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**
    - Implementing rate limiting on API endpoints and critical actions to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.
- **Data Protection (at Rest and in Transit):**
    - Encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database and object storage.
    - Enforcing HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
- **Vulnerability Management:**
    - Regularly updating dependencies (Ruby gems, JavaScript libraries, operating system packages) to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing.
- **Secure File Uploads:**
    - Validating file types and sizes upon upload.
    - Scanning uploaded files for malware.
    - Storing uploaded files securely and serving them with appropriate content security headers.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    - Implementing a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
- **Regular Security Audits:**
    - Conducting periodic security assessments and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Configuration Management:**
    - Securely managing and storing configuration settings, avoiding hardcoding sensitive information.
