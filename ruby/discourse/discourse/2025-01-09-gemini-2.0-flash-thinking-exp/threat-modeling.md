# Threat Model Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious forum post, user profile field, or private message containing JavaScript code. When another user views this content, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting them to phishing sites, or performing actions on their behalf. This directly involves Discourse's content rendering and sanitization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the forum for individual users, spreading of malicious content.
*   **Affected Component:** Post Renderer, User Profile Renderer, Private Message Renderer, potentially custom plugin rendering logic (if the plugin doesn't properly escape output).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on all user-provided content within Discourse's codebase.
    *   Utilize Discourse's built-in Content Security Policy (CSP) and configure it restrictively.
    *   Regularly review and update sanitization libraries and frameworks used by Discourse.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An administrator with sufficient privileges installs a plugin containing malicious code. This code executes within the Discourse environment and can directly interact with Discourse's core functionalities, database, and server resources.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Discourse instance, data breach, server takeover, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin System, potentially core Discourse components if the plugin has broad access through Discourse's plugin API.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and review the code of any third-party plugins before installation.
    *   Install plugins only from trusted sources.
    *   Implement a process for security review of plugins before allowing installation.
    *   Regularly audit installed plugins for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Restrict plugin installation privileges to a limited number of trusted administrators.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate plugin contains a security vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, remote code execution) within its code that interacts with Discourse. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control over Discourse or its data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, potential server compromise, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin and the Discourse APIs or components it interacts with.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in installed plugins.
    *   Implement a process for quickly patching or removing vulnerable plugins.
    *   Consider using plugin security scanners if available for the Discourse ecosystem.

## Threat: [API Key Exposure Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_key_exposure_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** API keys generated and managed by Discourse for integrations are exposed (e.g., due to insecure storage within Discourse's configuration or database). An attacker obtains these keys and uses them to access Discourse's API, potentially performing actions they are not authorized for, such as creating users, deleting content, or accessing private data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, manipulation of forum content, unauthorized user management.
*   **Affected Component:** API Authentication System, API Key Management Module, potentially any API endpoint depending on the compromised key's permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys securely within Discourse's infrastructure, utilizing encryption at rest.
    *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for API keys within Discourse, limiting their scope.
    *   Provide mechanisms for administrators to easily rotate API keys.
    *   Audit API key usage.

## Threat: [Insecure Theme Leading to XSS or Data Theft](./threats/insecure_theme_leading_to_xss_or_data_theft.md)

*   **Description:** A custom theme, directly affecting how Discourse renders content, contains malicious JavaScript or CSS code. This code can be used to perform XSS attacks, steal user data (e.g., through keylogging), or modify the appearance of the forum to trick users. This is a direct vulnerability within the theming system of Discourse.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Theme Rendering Engine, potentially core Discourse components if the theme interacts with them directly through template overrides or custom JavaScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and review the code of any custom themes before installation.
    *   Obtain themes from trusted sources.
    *   Restrict theme installation privileges.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) within Discourse to mitigate the impact of malicious scripts in themes.
