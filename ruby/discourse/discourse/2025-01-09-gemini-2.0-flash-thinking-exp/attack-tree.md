## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Discourse [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_authentication_bypass_vulnerability_in_discourse__critical_.md)

**How:** Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Discourse's authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth bypass, session hijacking).
* **Impact:** Gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrative accounts.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly update Discourse to the latest stable version, monitor security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Discourse Features](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_discourse_features.md)

**How:** Inject malicious scripts through Discourse features like posts, user profiles, custom fields, or theme components that are not properly sanitized.
* **Impact:** Steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding across all Discourse features, utilize Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Third-Party Plugin [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_third-party_plugin__critical_.md)

**How:** Identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in installed Discourse plugins (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass).
* **Impact:** Depends on the plugin's functionality, can range from data breaches to complete server compromise.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly review and update installed plugins, only install plugins from trusted sources, conduct security audits of critical plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Discourse Core [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_discourse_core__critical_.md)

**How:** Exploit critical vulnerabilities in Discourse's core codebase that allow for arbitrary code execution on the server.
* **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
* **Mitigation:** Keep Discourse updated, promptly apply security patches, implement strong server security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's API Interaction Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application's_api_interaction_logic.md)

**How:** Identify flaws in how the application interacts with the Discourse API, allowing for unintended actions or data manipulation.
* **Impact:** Depends on the API functionality, could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.
* **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test and validate API interactions, implement proper input validation and output encoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Shared Database Used by Application and Discourse](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_shared_database_used_by_application_and_discourse.md)

**How:** If the application and Discourse share a database, vulnerabilities in either application could lead to compromise of the shared data.
* **Impact:** Data breach affecting both the application and Discourse.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strong database security measures, use separate databases if possible, restrict database access based on the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Shared Hosting Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_shared_hosting_environment.md)

**How:** If the application and Discourse are hosted on the same server or within the same infrastructure, vulnerabilities in one could be used to compromise the other.
* **Impact:** Lateral movement within the infrastructure, potential compromise of both applications.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strong server hardening and isolation techniques, regularly patch the underlying operating system and infrastructure components.
