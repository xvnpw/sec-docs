# Attack Surface Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Attack Surface: [1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content (Markdown/BBCode)](./attack_surfaces/1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content__markdownbbcode_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages through user-generated content, which are then executed in other users' browsers when they view the content.
*   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse's core functionality relies on user-generated content formatted with Markdown and BBCode. Vulnerabilities in Discourse's parsing and rendering of these formats directly enable XSS attacks.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a Discourse post containing malicious Javascript embedded within a seemingly innocuous Markdown image link. When another user views this post, the script executes, stealing their session cookie and redirecting them to a phishing site, all within the context of the trusted Discourse domain.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft (including private messages and user profiles), defacement of the forum, malware distribution targeting forum users, sophisticated phishing attacks leveraging the forum's reputation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization and Output Encoding (Discourse Development):** Discourse developers must rigorously sanitize and encode all user-provided Markdown/BBCode input *server-side* before rendering it in the browser. Utilizing well-vetted and actively maintained secure Markdown parsing libraries is crucial.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Discourse Configuration & Development):** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy. Discourse administrators should configure CSP headers, and developers should ensure the application's architecture supports and benefits from CSP to limit the damage even if XSS vulnerabilities are present.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Discourse Operators):** Regularly audit Discourse instances, specifically focusing on user-generated content rendering and Markdown/BBCode parsing. Penetration testing should simulate XSS attacks through various user input vectors.
    *   **Keep Discourse and Dependencies Updated (Discourse Operators):**  Immediately apply security updates released by the Discourse team. These updates often patch newly discovered XSS vulnerabilities in the core platform and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Plugin and Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__plugin_and_theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in third-party plugins or themes that extend Discourse functionality or customize its appearance.
*   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse's plugin and theme architecture, while providing extensibility, inherently expands the attack surface.  Discourse directly facilitates the installation and execution of these third-party components.
*   **Example:** A popular Discourse plugin, designed for user polls, contains an SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through a crafted poll interaction, gaining direct access to the Discourse database and potentially extracting all user data, including hashed passwords and private forum content.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (potentially complete database compromise), account takeover, denial of service, complete compromise of the Discourse instance, depending on the plugin's privileges and the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **Critical** (Severity escalates to Critical if vulnerabilities allow database access or remote code execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Plugin and Theme Selection & Vetting (Discourse Operators):**  Exercise extreme caution when selecting and installing plugins and themes. Prioritize those from verified developers with strong security reputations and active maintenance. Review plugin/theme code if possible before deployment.
    *   **Regular Plugin and Theme Updates (Discourse Operators):**  Maintain a strict update schedule for all installed plugins and themes. Security vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and patched in these extensions.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage (Discourse Operators):**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege and only install absolutely necessary plugins and themes.  Reduce the attack surface by minimizing the number of third-party components.
    *   **Security Audits of Critical Plugins/Themes (Discourse Operators - for high-value instances):** For critical Discourse deployments, consider commissioning independent security audits or code reviews of essential plugins and themes, especially custom or less widely used ones.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing/Isolation (Discourse Development - potential future enhancement):**  Explore and advocate for stronger plugin sandboxing or isolation mechanisms within Discourse core to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in individual plugins.

## Attack Surface: [3. API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/3__api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Discourse's REST API authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functionalities.
*   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse provides a comprehensive REST API for integrations and automation.  The security of this API is directly managed by Discourse's core code and configuration. Flaws here directly expose Discourse's internal data and operations.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for moderators to manage user flags lacks proper authorization checks. An attacker discovers this endpoint and, even without moderator credentials, can use it to delete user posts or suspend accounts, disrupting forum operations and potentially causing data loss.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (access to user data, forum content, settings), unauthorized modification of forum data, account manipulation, denial of service through API abuse, potential escalation of privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if administrative API endpoints are vulnerable or if sensitive data is easily accessible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust API Authentication and Authorization (Discourse Development):** Discourse developers must ensure all API endpoints enforce strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and granular authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **API Rate Limiting (Discourse Development & Operators):** Implement and configure aggressive rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service attempts.
    *   **Regular API Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Discourse Operators & Development):**  Regularly audit the Discourse API for security vulnerabilities. Penetration testing should specifically target API endpoints and authentication/authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys (Discourse Operators):** When using API keys, grant them only the minimum necessary permissions and scope required for their intended purpose. Regularly review and revoke unused or overly permissive API keys.
    *   **Secure API Key Management (Discourse Operators):**  Store and manage API keys securely, avoiding embedding them directly in client-side code or publicly accessible configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [4. Administrative Interface Vulnerabilities and Insecure Configuration](./attack_surfaces/4__administrative_interface_vulnerabilities_and_insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the Discourse administrative interface itself or insecure default configurations that can be exploited to gain full control of the platform.
*   **Discourse Contribution:** Discourse's administrative interface is a core component, directly developed and maintained by the Discourse team. Vulnerabilities here directly compromise the entire platform. Insecure default configurations are also a direct responsibility of the platform's design.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the Discourse admin panel allows for authentication bypass, perhaps through a session fixation or CSRF flaw. An attacker exploits this to gain full administrator access without valid credentials, enabling them to modify any setting, create rogue admin accounts, inject malicious code, and completely control the Discourse instance and its data.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Discourse instance, total data breach, denial of service, reputational devastation, long-term control of the platform by attackers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Admin Interface Development (Discourse Development):** Discourse developers must prioritize security in the development of the admin interface, rigorously testing for common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and implementing secure coding practices.
    *   **Strong Admin Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Discourse Operators):** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for all administrator accounts. Mandate and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all admin logins to provide a critical second layer of security.
    *   **Regular Security Updates (Discourse Operators):**  Promptly apply all Discourse security updates, as these frequently address vulnerabilities in the admin interface.
    *   **Restrict Admin Access (Discourse Operators):** Limit access to the admin interface to only essential personnel and from trusted networks if feasible. Consider using IP whitelisting or VPNs to further restrict access.
    *   **Review and Harden Default Configurations (Discourse Operators):**  Thoroughly review all default Discourse configurations and harden them according to security best practices. This includes setting strong password policies, disabling unnecessary features, and carefully configuring access controls.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Admin Interface (Discourse Operators):**  Include the administrative interface as a primary focus in regular security audits and penetration testing. Simulate attacks targeting admin login, privilege escalation, and configuration manipulation.
