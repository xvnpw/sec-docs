# Threat Model Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing](./threats/account_takeover_via_brute-forcecredential_stuffing.md)

* **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user passwords through repeated login attempts (brute-force) or use stolen credentials from other breaches (credential stuffing) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. They might use automated tools to try common passwords or lists of leaked credentials against Discourse login form.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for data breaches, spamming, forum disruption, and reputational damage.
* **Affected Discourse Component:** Authentication Module, Login Form
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong password policies and enforce them.
    * Enable and configure Discourse's built-in rate limiting for login attempts.
    * Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to further rate limit and block malicious login attempts.
    * Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and password managers.
    * Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for user accounts, especially for administrators.
    * Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity and investigate anomalies.

## Threat: [Password Reset Vulnerabilities](./threats/password_reset_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in the password reset process to gain access to user accounts. This could involve manipulating password reset tokens, intercepting reset emails, or exploiting logic errors in the reset flow within Discourse. They might try to bypass email verification or brute-force reset tokens generated by Discourse.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data breaches, user impersonation, and reputational damage.
* **Affected Discourse Component:** Password Reset Module, Email System
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly test the password reset process for vulnerabilities.
    * Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens (ensure Discourse configuration does this).
    * Ensure secure email delivery and consider using a reputable email service provider.
    * Implement rate limiting for password reset requests within Discourse configuration.
    * Educate users about phishing attempts related to password resets.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content (posts, topics, usernames, custom fields) that is then executed in other users' browsers when they view the content within Discourse. They might use Markdown or HTML injection vulnerabilities in Discourse's parsing to embed `<script>` tags or event handlers.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of forum pages, information theft, and malware distribution.
* **Affected Discourse Component:** Markdown Parser, HTML Renderer, User Input Handling
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure robust input sanitization and output encoding are in place within Discourse for all user-generated content.
    * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources and mitigate XSS impact (configure in web server and Discourse if possible).
    * Regularly update Discourse to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on XSS vulnerabilities in Discourse's content handling.
    * Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or content.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in third-party Discourse plugins to compromise the forum. Plugins, being extensions to Discourse, might contain XSS, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices or lack of updates. They might target popular or outdated plugins available for Discourse.
* **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, including data breaches, account compromise, forum takeover, and denial of service.
* **Affected Discourse Component:** Plugin System, Specific Plugins
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Only install plugins from trusted sources and reputable developers within the Discourse plugin ecosystem.
    * Regularly review and audit installed plugins for security vulnerabilities and updates.
    * Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions available for Discourse.
    * Remove or disable plugins that are no longer needed or actively maintained.
    * Implement a plugin security review process before installing new plugins, checking for known vulnerabilities or security best practices.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Admin Panel](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_admin_panel.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Discourse admin panel, often through weak admin passwords, exposed admin interfaces, or vulnerabilities in the admin login process of Discourse. They might brute-force admin credentials or exploit misconfigurations in Discourse's admin panel security.
* **Impact:** Full control over the forum, data breaches, forum defacement, complete service disruption, and reputational damage.
* **Affected Discourse Component:** Admin Panel, Authentication Module, Authorization Module
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use strong, unique passwords for all administrator accounts.
    * Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts within Discourse if available or through external authentication mechanisms.
    * Restrict access to the admin panel to authorized IP addresses or networks if possible using web server or firewall configurations.
    * Regularly audit admin user accounts and permissions within Discourse.
    * Keep Discourse and its dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities, including those affecting the admin panel.
    * Monitor admin panel login attempts for suspicious activity.
