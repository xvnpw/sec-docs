# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Vet Discourse Plugins and Themes](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_vet_discourse_plugins_and_themes.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strictly Vet Discourse Plugins and Themes**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify the Plugin/Theme within Discourse Ecosystem:** Focus on plugins and themes available through Discourse's plugin ecosystem or designed specifically for Discourse.
    2.  **Check Developer Reputation within Discourse Community:** Research the developer or organization *within the Discourse community*. Look for their contributions to Discourse, reputation on the official Discourse forums, and feedback from other Discourse users.
    3.  **Review Source Code (Discourse Context):** If reviewing source code, focus on how the plugin/theme interacts with Discourse's core functionalities, APIs, and data models. Look for potential conflicts or security issues specific to Discourse's architecture.
    4.  **Check Community Feedback on Discourse Forums:** Search for reviews and discussions about the plugin/theme specifically on the official Discourse forums (e.g., meta.discourse.org). Pay attention to Discourse-specific compatibility issues or security concerns raised by the Discourse community.
    5.  **Prioritize Official Discourse Plugins/Themes:**  Favor plugins and themes officially maintained by the Discourse team or recognized as highly trusted within the Discourse ecosystem.
    6.  **Test in a Discourse Staging Environment:** Test the plugin/theme in a staging environment that is a *clone of your Discourse production instance*, ensuring Discourse-specific configurations and customizations are mirrored.
    7.  **Document Vetting Process (Discourse Context):** Document the vetting process specifically in relation to Discourse plugin/theme security best practices and community guidelines.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Discourse Plugin/Theme Installation (High Severity):** Installation of plugins or themes designed to exploit Discourse-specific vulnerabilities or introduce backdoors within the Discourse platform.
    *   **Vulnerable Discourse Plugin/Theme Installation (Medium to High Severity):** Installation of plugins or themes with security flaws that are exploitable within the context of a Discourse application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Discourse Plugin/Theme Installation:** Significantly reduces the risk of introducing intentionally harmful code *into your Discourse instance*.
    *   **Vulnerable Discourse Plugin/Theme Installation:** Moderately to Significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities *within your Discourse application* by avoiding plugins/themes with known or likely flaws.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Plugin/theme requests are informally reviewed, often considering the source and general reputation, but a formal Discourse-focused vetting process is lacking. Discourse community feedback is sometimes considered, but not systematically.
    *   Location: Project's informal plugin/theme approval process, developer guidelines (partially documented, Discourse-agnostic).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documented plugin and theme vetting process *specifically tailored for Discourse*, referencing Discourse security best practices and community resources.
    *   Mandatory code review for all non-official plugins and themes *within the Discourse context* before production deployment.
    *   Leveraging Discourse community resources and vulnerability databases (if available) during vetting.
    *   Regular audits of installed plugins and themes *in the context of Discourse updates and security advisories*.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Discourse](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_content_security_policy__csp__for_discourse.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Discourse**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Directives Considering Discourse Architecture:** Define CSP directives that are compatible with Discourse's front-end architecture, including its JavaScript framework (Ember.js) and plugin/theme structure.
    2.  **Address Discourse Plugin/Theme CSP Compatibility:**  Pay special attention to CSP compatibility with installed Discourse plugins and themes. Some plugins/themes might require specific CSP exceptions or adjustments. Test thoroughly after plugin/theme installations.
    3.  **Utilize Discourse's CSP Configuration Options (If Available):** Check if Discourse provides any built-in configuration options or settings related to CSP. Leverage these if available to simplify CSP management within the Discourse environment.
    4.  **Report-Only Mode Initially (Discourse Context):** Deploy CSP in report-only mode on your Discourse instance first. Monitor reports specifically for violations related to Discourse core functionality, plugins, and themes.
    5.  **Enforce CSP in Discourse Production:**  Switch to enforce mode on your production Discourse instance after thorough testing and addressing violations.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update CSP (Discourse Context):**  Review and update CSP whenever you update Discourse core, plugins, or themes, as these changes might introduce new CSP requirements or incompatibilities.
    7.  **Configure Web Server to Send CSP Header (for Discourse):** Configure your web server to send the `Content-Security-Policy` header specifically for your Discourse application's responses.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks in Discourse (High Severity):** CSP is a crucial defense against XSS attacks *targeting your Discourse forum*. It mitigates XSS vulnerabilities that might exist in Discourse core, plugins, or themes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks in Discourse:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks *within your Discourse application*. A well-configured CSP tailored for Discourse can effectively neutralize many XSS attempts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. A basic CSP might be in place, but it may not be strictly configured for Discourse's specific needs and plugin/theme ecosystem. Compatibility testing with Discourse components might be insufficient.
    *   Location: Web server configuration (Nginx/Apache for Discourse), potentially Discourse configuration files (if Discourse offers CSP settings).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Transition to a stricter CSP *specifically designed for Discourse*, considering its architecture and plugin/theme ecosystem.
    *   Comprehensive CSP testing *within the Discourse environment*, including all plugins and themes.
    *   Automated CSP violation reporting and monitoring *for the Discourse instance*.
    *   Regular review and updates of the CSP *in sync with Discourse updates and plugin/theme changes*.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Discourse API Key Management and Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/secure_discourse_api_key_management_and_least_privilege.md)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Discourse API keys are used, stored as environment variables, but Discourse-specific least privilege and API permission configurations might not be fully utilized. Monitoring is basic or absent for Discourse API usage.
    *   Location: Application configuration, environment variables, integration code interacting with the Discourse API.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal API key management policy *specifically for Discourse API keys*.
    *   Leveraging Discourse's API permission system to enforce least privilege.
    *   Automated rotation of Discourse API keys.
    *   Detailed monitoring and logging of Discourse API key usage *within the Discourse context*.
    *   Incident response plan *specifically for Discourse API key compromise*.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Webhook Signature Verification for Discourse Webhooks](./mitigation_strategies/implement_webhook_signature_verification_for_discourse_webhooks.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Implement Webhook Signature Verification for Discourse Webhooks**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Discourse Webhook Configuration with Secret Key:** When configuring webhooks *within Discourse*, ensure a secret key is set for signature generation.
    2.  **Webhook Endpoint Implementation for Discourse Webhooks:** Implement signature verification logic on your webhook endpoints that receive webhooks *from Discourse*.
    3.  **Discourse Signature Calculation and Header:** Understand how Discourse calculates webhook signatures and which header it uses to send the signature (e.g., `X-Discourse-Signature`).
    4.  **Signature Verification at Endpoint (Discourse Context):**  Your webhook endpoint receiving Discourse webhooks must verify the signature using the *Discourse-configured secret key* and the expected signature algorithm.
    5.  **Reject Invalid Signatures from Discourse:** Reject webhook requests with invalid signatures, indicating potential spoofing or tampering *of Discourse webhooks*.
    6.  **Securely Store Discourse Webhook Secret:** Securely store the webhook secret key configured in Discourse, treating it as sensitive information.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Discourse Webhook Spoofing (Medium to High Severity):** Without signature verification, attackers could send forged webhook requests *mimicking Discourse webhooks*, potentially triggering unintended actions or data manipulation in systems integrated with Discourse.
    *   **Discourse Webhook Replay Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):** Signature verification for Discourse webhooks helps, but consider timestamp or nonce-based mechanisms for stronger replay attack prevention if needed for sensitive webhook actions triggered by Discourse.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Discourse Webhook Spoofing:** Significantly reduces the risk of accepting spoofed webhook requests *intended to appear as originating from Discourse*.
    *   **Discourse Webhook Replay Attacks:** Minimally reduces replay risk with basic signature verification. Additional measures might be needed for stronger replay attack mitigation *for Discourse webhooks*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Webhooks are used for Discourse integrations, but signature verification for *Discourse webhooks* is not enabled. Security relies on endpoint obscurity, not robust verification.
    *   Location: Webhook endpoint code, Discourse webhook configuration (within Discourse admin panel).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enabling webhook signature generation in Discourse webhook settings *within the Discourse admin panel*.
    *   Implementing signature verification logic in webhook endpoints that process *Discourse webhooks*.
    *   Secure storage of the webhook secret key *configured in Discourse*.
    *   Logging of signature verification failures *for Discourse webhook processing*.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Discourse Updates and Patch Management](./mitigation_strategies/regular_discourse_updates_and_patch_management.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Regular Discourse Updates and Patch Management**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Discourse Security Channels:** Actively monitor official Discourse channels (e.g., meta.discourse.org, security mailing lists) for security announcements and updates *specifically related to Discourse*.
    2.  **Establish Discourse Update Schedule:** Create a schedule for regularly updating your Discourse instance, prioritizing security updates *released by the Discourse team*.
    3.  **Test Discourse Updates in Staging:** Thoroughly test Discourse updates in a staging environment that is a *clone of your production Discourse instance* before applying them to production.
    4.  **Apply Discourse Updates Methodically (Discourse Procedures):** Follow Discourse's recommended update procedures, typically using Discourse's built-in update mechanisms (e.g., `launcher rebuild app`).
    5.  **Backup Discourse Before Updating:** Always create a full backup of your Discourse data and configuration *before updating your Discourse instance*.
    6.  **Verify Discourse Update Success:** After updating Discourse, verify that *your Discourse instance* is functioning correctly and the update was successful. Check Discourse logs and test key Discourse functionalities.
