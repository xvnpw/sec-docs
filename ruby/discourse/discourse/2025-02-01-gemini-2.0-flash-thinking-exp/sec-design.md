# BUSINESS POSTURE

Discourse is an open-source internet forum and mailing list management software. It aims to modernize online discussions by providing a platform that is engaging, user-friendly, and scalable.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a modern, user-friendly forum platform.
  - Enable communities to grow and thrive through online discussions.
  - Offer a scalable and reliable platform for various community sizes.
  - Support open-source principles and community contributions.
  - Offer both self-hosted and hosted solutions to cater to different user needs.

- Most important business risks:
  - Data breaches and data loss, leading to reputational damage and loss of user trust.
  - Service disruptions and downtime, impacting community engagement and platform reliability.
  - Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise user accounts or platform integrity.
  - Difficulty in scaling the platform to meet growing community demands.
  - Negative perception due to lack of security features or poor security practices.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (location: likely documented in security policies or blog posts, but needs verification).
  - security control: Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) practices, including code reviews and security testing (location: likely internal development processes, needs verification).
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection (location: within the application codebase).
  - security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to forum features and data (location: within the application codebase).
  - security control: Protection against common web attacks like CSRF (location: within the application codebase).
  - security control: HTTPS encryption for communication between users and the platform (location: deployment configuration).
  - security control: Rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts (location: application or infrastructure level).
  - security control: Regular security updates and patching of dependencies (location: development and maintenance processes).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching (inherent to open-source projects).
  - accepted risk: Potential for misconfigurations in self-hosted deployments by users (outside of Discourse control).

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities for security events and incident response.
  - security control: Formalize incident response plan and procedures.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning and management tools to ensure timely patching of vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Provide security hardening guidelines for self-hosted deployments.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure user authentication mechanisms, including password-based login, social logins (OAuth), and potentially multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - Requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
    - Requirement: Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to forum features (e.g., admin, moderator, user).
    - Requirement: Granular permissions to control access to categories, topics, and administrative functions.
    - Requirement: Secure API authorization for external integrations.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
    - Requirement: Validation on both client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data at rest, such as API keys or secrets (if applicable).
    - Requirement: Proper handling of cryptographic keys and secrets.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific security audit and penetration testing schedules and findings for Discourse?
  - What specific SAST/DAST tools are currently used or planned for use in the development pipeline?
  - Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) currently supported or planned for Discourse user accounts and administrative accounts?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: Discourse prioritizes user privacy and data security due to the nature of online forum platforms and the sensitivity of user-generated content.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Discourse follows secure software development practices and implements common web application security controls. However, as an open-source project, it relies on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - DESIGN: Discourse is designed as a modern web application with a modular architecture, utilizing containers and cloud-native technologies for deployment and scalability. It leverages common components like databases, caching systems, and background job processors. The deployment model assumes a cloud-based environment for scalability and manageability.
