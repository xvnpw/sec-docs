# Threat Model Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Threat: [Admin/Moderator Account Takeover via Phishing/Credential Stuffing (Discourse-Specific Aspects)](./threats/adminmoderator_account_takeover_via_phishingcredential_stuffing__discourse-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets Discourse administrators or moderators with phishing emails that convincingly mimic legitimate Discourse notifications (e.g., password reset requests, new user reports) or login pages. The attacker leverages Discourse's reliance on email for account recovery. Credential stuffing attacks exploit reused passwords, targeting the Discourse login specifically.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the forum. The attacker can delete content, ban users, change site settings, access private messages, deface the site, or use it for further attacks.
    *   **Discourse Component Affected:** User authentication system (login, password reset, session management), email notification system (as a vector for phishing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA (TOTP or WebAuthn) for *all* administrator and moderator accounts. This is the single most effective mitigation, directly addressing the Discourse-specific reliance on email.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords. Utilize Discourse's built-in password strength enforcement.
        *   **Admin/Moderator Training:** Specific training on recognizing Discourse-themed phishing attempts.
        *   **Login Attempt Monitoring:** Monitor login attempts for patterns indicative of credential stuffing, specifically targeting Discourse accounts.
        *   **Limit Admin Accounts:** Minimize the number of administrator accounts.

## Threat: [SSO Integration Bypass](./threats/sso_integration_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Discourse SSO *plugin* (e.g., a flaw in the OAuth 2.0 or SAML implementation) or a flaw in how Discourse integrates with the third-party SSO provider. The attacker forges authentication tokens or manipulates redirects to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrator or moderator accounts if SSO is used for those roles.
    *   **Discourse Component Affected:** SSO plugin (e.g., `omniauth-google-oauth2`, `omniauth-facebook`, `omniauth-github`), Discourse's authentication integration code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Well-Vetted SSO Plugins:** Only use officially supported or widely used and *actively maintained* SSO plugins.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:**  Immediate updates to both Discourse and the SSO plugin are critical.
        *   **Monitor SSO Provider Security:** Stay informed about the SSO provider's security.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the SSO *integration* specifically.
        *   **Limit SSO for Privileged Accounts:** Consider *not* using SSO for admin/moderator accounts.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Data Tampering](./threats/malicious_plugin_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious *Discourse plugin* that directly modifies the Discourse database. The plugin could alter posts, user data, site settings, or insert backdoors. This leverages the power of Discourse's plugin architecture.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, potential compromise of the entire forum.
    *   **Discourse Component Affected:** Plugin system, database interaction layer (ActiveRecord models), any part of Discourse accessible to plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from the official Discourse repository or highly trusted developers.
        *   **Code Review:** *Thorough* code review of any custom plugins or plugins from less-known sources, focusing on database interactions.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing (if available):** Utilize any available plugin sandboxing mechanisms.
        *   **Regular Plugin Audits:** Periodically review all installed plugins.
        *   **Database Backups:** Frequent, secure, and *tested* backups are essential for recovery.
        *   **Least Privilege Database User:** Ensure the Discourse database user (used by the application and plugins) has only necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Unpatched Discourse Core Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_discourse_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly disclosed or zero-day vulnerability in the *Discourse core software itself*. This could be a flaw in any part of Discourse, from authentication to post rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, but can include complete remote code execution (RCE) and forum takeover.
    *   **Discourse Component Affected:** Potentially any part of the Discourse core codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE or privilege escalation), High (for other significant vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Discourse Updated:** This is paramount. Subscribe to Discourse's security announcements and apply updates *immediately*.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly check for security advisories related to Discourse.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide some mitigation, but is not a primary defense.

## Threat: [Leaked API Key Abuse (Discourse-Specific)](./threats/leaked_api_key_abuse__discourse-specific_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker obtains a Discourse API key and uses it to make unauthorized requests to the *Discourse API*, potentially impersonating users, modifying content, or extracting data. The impact depends on the API key's permissions.
    * **Impact:** Ranges from data leaks to complete forum compromise, depending on the API key's permissions.
    * **Discourse Component Affected:** Discourse API, authentication system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if the key has broad permissions)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure API Key Storage:** Never store API keys in code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration system.
        * **Least Privilege Principle:** Create API keys with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
        * **API Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys.
        * **API Usage Monitoring:** Monitor API usage for suspicious activity, specifically targeting Discourse API endpoints.
        * **IP Address Whitelisting:** If possible, restrict API key usage to specific IP addresses.

## Threat: [Unsafe File Uploads (Beyond Images) - *Discourse Plugin or Misconfiguration*](./threats/unsafe_file_uploads__beyond_images__-_discourse_plugin_or_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  A custom *Discourse plugin* or a misconfiguration of Discourse's upload handling allows users to upload file types beyond images (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, executable files) that could lead to XSS or code execution. This is distinct from general file upload vulnerabilities; it's about bypassing Discourse's intended restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, XSS attacks, or other security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Discourse Component Affected:** File upload handling, potentially any plugins that handle file uploads, Discourse's content sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Type Whitelisting:** Only allow specific, safe file types. Enforce this *within Discourse's configuration and any relevant plugins*.
        *   **File Content Inspection:** If possible, inspect file content to ensure it matches the expected type, going beyond simple extension checks.
        *   **Store Uploads Outside Web Root:** Store uploaded files outside the web root.
        *   **Serve Uploads with Correct Content-Type:** Ensure correct Content-Type headers.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS.
        * **Review Plugin Code:** Thoroughly review any custom plugins that handle file uploads.
