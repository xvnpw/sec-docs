# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Plugin and Theme Management](./mitigation_strategies/strict_plugin_and_theme_management.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Plugin and Theme Management**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Plugin/Theme Review Process:** Before installing *any* plugin or theme, a designated team (ideally including developers with security experience) reviews:
        *   The source code (if available) for obvious vulnerabilities, focusing on how the plugin interacts with Discourse's API and data models. Look for improper use of Discourse's helper functions, direct database queries bypassing Discourse's ORM, and insecure handling of user data within the Discourse context.
        *   The developer's reputation and track record on the Discourse Meta forum and other relevant communities.
        *   The plugin's update history – frequent updates addressing security issues are a good sign; long periods of inactivity are a warning.  Check if the plugin is actively maintained *within the Discourse ecosystem*.
        *   User reviews and community feedback for any reported issues, specifically looking for reports of conflicts or security problems *within Discourse*.
    2.  **Prioritize Official/Trusted Sources:** Prefer plugins and themes from the official Discourse team or well-established, reputable community developers *known for their Discourse contributions*.
    3.  **Minimize Plugin Count:** Only install plugins that are *absolutely necessary* for the forum's functionality. Each plugin increases the attack surface *within Discourse*.
    4.  **Staging Environment Testing:** *Always* install and test new plugins/themes, and updates to existing ones, in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment *before* deploying to production. This includes:
        *   Functionality testing: Does the plugin work as expected *within Discourse*?
        *   Security testing: Attempt basic attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF) that exploit potential weaknesses in how the plugin interacts with Discourse's features.
        *   Performance testing: Does the plugin significantly impact Discourse's performance?
    5.  **Regular Updates:** Enable automatic updates for trusted plugins (if the option is available and you trust the source, *and it's a Discourse-aware update mechanism*) or establish a strict schedule for manual updates. Check for updates at least weekly, *specifically within the Discourse update system*.
    6.  **Monitor for Vulnerability Announcements:** Subscribe to the Discourse Meta forum's security category and any plugin-specific forums or mailing lists to be notified of security vulnerabilities *related to Discourse*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) (High Severity):** Malicious plugins/themes can inject JavaScript code into the Discourse forum, leveraging Discourse's rendering engine.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) (High Severity):** Attackers can exploit Discourse's user session management if a plugin has CSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical Severity):** Poorly coded plugins can bypass Discourse's ORM and execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):** A plugin vulnerability could allow execution of code within the Discourse server environment.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to Discourse user data, private messages, or other sensitive information stored within Discourse.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** A buggy or malicious plugin could consume excessive resources, impacting Discourse's performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low/Medium).
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Plugin review process partially implemented: Developers informally review plugins, but no formal Discourse-specific checklist.
    *   Staging environment used for major updates, but not consistently for all plugin updates within Discourse.
    *   Automatic updates enabled for a few "trusted" plugins via Discourse's system.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented plugin review process with a Discourse-specific security checklist.
    *   Consistent use of the staging environment for *all* plugin and theme updates managed through Discourse.
    *   Dedicated security testing focused on Discourse integration points.
    *   Centralized tracking of installed plugins, versions, and update status within Discourse.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proactive Discourse Core Updates](./mitigation_strategies/proactive_discourse_core_updates.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:  Proactive Discourse Core Updates**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the "security" category on the Discourse Meta forum (meta.discourse.org) to receive immediate notifications of security releases *for Discourse itself*.
    2.  **Automated Updates (Preferred):** If using a managed Discourse hosting provider, ensure automatic updates are enabled *for the Discourse application*. If self-hosting, consider configuring automatic updates using Discourse's built-in mechanisms (if available and you're comfortable with the potential for minor disruptions). *This relies on Discourse's update system*.
    3.  **Manual Update Schedule (If Automated Updates Not Used):** Establish a *strict* schedule for manually updating Discourse *through its admin panel or command-line tools*. Aim to update within 24-48 hours of a security release. This requires monitoring the Meta forum closely.
    4.  **Staging Environment Testing (Before Production Updates):** Before applying *any* Discourse update to the production environment, apply it to a staging environment that mirrors production. Test:
        *   Basic Discourse forum functionality.
        *   Any custom Discourse plugins or themes.
        *   Discourse's performance.
    5.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a clear plan in place to quickly roll back to a previous version of Discourse if an update causes problems. This usually involves restoring from a recent Discourse backup *using Discourse's backup/restore tools*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All vulnerabilities in the Discourse core:** This includes XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, RCE, and any other flaws that might be discovered in the core Discourse software. Severity varies, but can range from Low to Critical.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduces the risk of *all* core Discourse vulnerabilities to the lowest possible level, *provided updates are applied promptly*. Impact is generally from High/Critical to Negligible/Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Subscribed to the Discourse Meta security announcements.
    *   Manual update process in place via Discourse's admin panel, but updates are sometimes delayed.
    *   Staging environment used for major version upgrades, but not always for minor security patches within Discourse.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated updates (either through a managed host or self-hosted Discourse configuration).
    *   Consistent use of the staging environment for *all* Discourse updates, including minor security patches.
    *   Formalized rollback plan using Discourse's backup/restore functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Content Security Policy (CSP) (Using Discourse's Tools)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_content_security_policy__csp___using_discourse's_tools_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:  Robust Content Security Policy (CSP) (Using Discourse's Tools)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand CSP:** Thoroughly research and understand the Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header and its directives.
    2.  **Initial Strict Policy:** Start with a very restrictive CSP that blocks *everything* by default (`default-src 'none'`).
    3.  **Gradual Whitelisting:** Gradually whitelist only the specific sources that are *absolutely necessary* for your Discourse forum to function. This includes:
        *   Your own domain (`self`).
        *   Sources for images, scripts, stylesheets, fonts, etc., *as used by Discourse and its plugins*. Be as specific as possible.
        *   Any third-party services you use *that are integrated with Discourse* (e.g., CDNs, analytics providers) – *only* if absolutely necessary and from trusted sources.
    4.  **Use Discourse's CSP Tools:** *Crucially*, use Discourse's built-in tools (in the admin panel) to manage CSP settings. This ensures the CSP is correctly integrated with Discourse's rendering engine and plugin system.
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Use browser developer tools and Discourse's reporting features (if available) to identify any resources that are being blocked by your CSP. Adjust the policy as needed *within Discourse's settings*.
    6.  **Report-Only Mode:** Initially, use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header (configured through Discourse) to test your policy without actually blocking anything.
    7.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review your CSP *within Discourse's admin panel* to ensure it's still appropriate and hasn't become overly permissive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) (High Severity):** A well-crafted CSP, *managed through Discourse*, is a very effective defense against XSS attacks that might try to exploit Discourse's rendering.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** CSP can help prevent clickjacking by controlling how your Discourse forum can be framed (using the `frame-ancestors` directive), managed through Discourse's settings.
    *   **Data Injection (Medium Severity):** CSP can limit the types of data loaded, reducing the risk of certain data injection attacks targeting Discourse.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
    *   **Data Injection:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic CSP implemented using Discourse's built-in settings, but it's likely too permissive.
    *   No use of `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` for testing within Discourse.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review and refinement of the existing CSP *within Discourse's settings* to make it more restrictive.
    *   Use of `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` for testing *through Discourse*.
    *   Regular review and updates to the CSP *using Discourse's tools*.
    *   Documentation of the CSP and its rationale, specifically related to Discourse's configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Usage (Within the Discourse Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_usage__within_the_discourse_ecosystem_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Secure API Usage (Within the Discourse Ecosystem)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **API Key Management (Discourse Admin Panel):**
        *   Generate strong, unique API keys *using Discourse's admin panel* for each application or service that needs to access the Discourse API.
        *   Store API keys securely, *never* in client-side code or publicly accessible repositories.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys *through Discourse's interface*.
        *   Revoke API keys immediately if they are compromised, *using Discourse's controls*.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Discourse Permissions):**
        *   Grant each API key only the *minimum* necessary permissions *using Discourse's built-in permission system*.
        *   Use Discourse's API key management features to control permissions granularly.
    3.  **Rate Limiting (Discourse Settings):**
        *   Implement rate limiting for API requests *using Discourse's built-in rate limiting features*.
        *   Configure rate limits appropriately to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks targeting the Discourse API.
    4.  **Input Validation (Within Discourse's API Framework):**
        *   If developing custom plugins that interact with the Discourse API, validate *all* input received via the API *using Discourse's recommended validation methods*.
    5.  **Authentication and Authorization (Discourse's Mechanisms):**
        *   Ensure that all API requests are properly authenticated and authorized *using Discourse's built-in authentication mechanisms* (e.g., API keys, user authentication).
        *   Leverage Discourse's user and group management for API access control.
    6. **HTTPS Only (Discourse Configuration):**
        * Enforce HTTPS for all API communication to protect data in transit. Configure this within Discourse's site settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Proper API key management and authentication within Discourse prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Secure API usage within Discourse prevents attackers from accessing or modifying sensitive data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting, configured through Discourse, prevents API-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Input validation within custom plugins using Discourse's framework prevents injection attacks.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Enforcing HTTPS via Discourse's settings prevents MitM attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API keys are used, managed through Discourse, but not regularly rotated.
    *   Basic rate limiting is in place via Discourse's settings.
    *   HTTPS is enforced through Discourse's configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular API key rotation *using Discourse's interface*.
    *   Principle of least privilege for API keys (some keys have more permissions than necessary *within Discourse*).
    *   Thorough input validation for all API endpoints *within custom Discourse plugins*.
    *   Documentation of API security practices, specifically related to Discourse's API.
