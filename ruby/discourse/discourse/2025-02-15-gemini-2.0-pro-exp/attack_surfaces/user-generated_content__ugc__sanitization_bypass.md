# Deep Analysis: User-Generated Content (UGC) Sanitization Bypass in Discourse

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "User-Generated Content (UGC) Sanitization Bypass" attack surface within the context of a Discourse application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, understanding how Discourse's features contribute to the risk, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide developers with a prioritized list of areas to focus on for hardening the application against this class of attacks.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on vulnerabilities related to the processing and rendering of user-generated content within Discourse, including:

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   Posts (topics and replies)
    *   Comments (if enabled)
    *   User profiles (bio, custom fields)
    *   Private messages
    *   Group descriptions
    *   Poll options
    *   Any other area where users can input text or formatted content.

*   **Discourse Features:**
    *   Markdown parsing (including extensions and variations)
    *   BBCode parsing (if enabled)
    *   HTML rendering (if enabled, and its interaction with sanitization)
    *   Onebox functionality (link previews)
    *   Embedded content (e.g., iframes, videos)
    *   Custom plugins that introduce new input methods or rendering logic.

*   **Exclusions:**
    *   Vulnerabilities *not* directly related to UGC sanitization (e.g., SQL injection in a different part of the application, server misconfiguration).
    *   Attacks that rely on social engineering *without* a technical sanitization bypass (e.g., tricking a user into clicking a malicious link that *isn't* exploiting a Discourse vulnerability).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the Discourse codebase (available on GitHub) to identify:
    *   Sanitization functions and libraries used (e.g., `Sanitize`, `Loofah`, Markdown parsers).
    *   Areas where user input is directly inserted into the DOM or used in potentially dangerous contexts (e.g., `innerHTML`, `eval`, `script` tags).
    *   Regular expressions used for input validation and filtering.
    *   Configuration options related to HTML, BBCode, and Onebox.
    *   Known vulnerable patterns (e.g., mXSS, DOM-based XSS).

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing and Penetration Testing):**
    *   We will use automated fuzzing tools (e.g., `wfuzz`, `Burp Suite Intruder`, custom scripts) to send a wide range of malicious payloads to Discourse input fields.  These payloads will target known XSS and HTML injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Manual penetration testing will be conducted to explore edge cases and bypasses that automated tools might miss.  This includes crafting complex Markdown, BBCode, and HTML payloads.
    *   We will specifically test the interaction between different input formats (e.g., Markdown nested within BBCode).

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   We will review publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to Discourse and its dependencies (e.g., Markdown parsers, sanitization libraries).
    *   We will analyze bug reports and security advisories to understand past attack vectors and fixes.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   We will consider various attacker profiles (e.g., script kiddies, motivated attackers) and their potential goals (e.g., account takeover, data exfiltration).
    *   We will map out attack paths that could lead to successful exploitation of UGC sanitization bypasses.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities

Discourse primarily uses Markdown for user input.  The complexity of Markdown parsing, especially with extensions, creates a significant attack surface.

*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   **Markdown Parser Bugs:**  Vulnerabilities in the specific Markdown parser used by Discourse (e.g., `markdown-it`, or previously `kramdown`) can lead to XSS.  These parsers are complex and may have edge cases that allow malicious code to bypass sanitization.
    *   **Nested Markdown:**  Incorrect handling of nested Markdown structures (e.g., lists within blockquotes within links) can create opportunities for bypasses.
    *   **HTML within Markdown:**  If Discourse allows raw HTML within Markdown (even in a limited form), this significantly increases the risk.  The interaction between Markdown parsing and HTML sanitization is a common source of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Custom Markdown Extensions:**  Discourse plugins can add custom Markdown extensions.  These extensions must be carefully audited for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):**  Poorly crafted regular expressions within the Markdown parser can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service attack, potentially impacting sanitization.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `lib/cooked_processor.rb` file (and related files) in the Discourse codebase.  This is where the Markdown parsing and sanitization logic resides.
    *   Identify the specific Markdown parser and version used.
    *   Look for any custom regular expressions used for Markdown processing.
    *   Analyze how HTML is handled within Markdown.

*   **Fuzzing Targets:**
    *   Send a variety of Markdown payloads, including:
        *   Nested structures (lists, blockquotes, links, emphasis).
        *   Edge cases (e.g., unusual characters, long strings).
        *   Known XSS payloads adapted for Markdown.
        *   Payloads targeting specific Markdown parser vulnerabilities (if known).

### 2.2. BBCode Parsing Vulnerabilities (if enabled)

If BBCode is enabled, it introduces another layer of parsing and potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   **BBCode Parser Bugs:** Similar to Markdown, the BBCode parser itself may have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Nested BBCode:**  Incorrect handling of nested BBCode tags can lead to bypasses.
    *   **Interaction with Markdown:**  If users can mix BBCode and Markdown, this creates a complex interaction that can be exploited.
    *   **Custom BBCodes:**  Discourse allows administrators to define custom BBCodes.  These custom BBCodes must be carefully reviewed for security vulnerabilities.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the code responsible for BBCode parsing (likely in a separate module or plugin).
    *   Identify the specific BBCode parser and version used.
    *   Look for any custom regular expressions used for BBCode processing.
    *   Analyze how BBCode interacts with Markdown (if both are enabled).

*   **Fuzzing Targets:**
    *   Similar to Markdown, send a variety of BBCode payloads, focusing on nested tags, edge cases, and known vulnerabilities.

### 2.3. HTML Sanitization Bypass (if HTML is enabled)

If Discourse allows any form of HTML input, even "safe" HTML, this is a high-risk area.

*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   **Whitelist vs. Blacklist:**  A whitelist approach (allowing only specific HTML tags and attributes) is much more secure than a blacklist approach (blocking known dangerous tags and attributes).
    *   **Attribute-Based XSS:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into HTML attributes (e.g., `onmouseover`, `onerror`).
    *   **CSS-Based XSS:**  Malicious CSS can be used to execute JavaScript in some browsers.
    *   **mXSS (Mutation XSS):**  The browser's DOM parsing can mutate seemingly safe HTML into malicious code.  This is a particularly difficult type of XSS to prevent.
    *   **DOM Clobbering:**  Attackers can manipulate the DOM to overwrite existing JavaScript variables or functions, leading to XSS.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `lib/sanitize.rb` file (and related files).  This is where the HTML sanitization logic resides.
    *   Identify the specific sanitization library used (e.g., `Loofah`, `Sanitize`).
    *   Analyze the whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes.
    *   Look for any custom sanitization rules.
    *   Check for known vulnerable patterns (e.g., `javascript:` URLs, `data:` URLs, event handlers).

*   **Fuzzing Targets:**
    *   Send a variety of HTML payloads, including:
        *   Payloads targeting specific HTML tags and attributes.
        *   Payloads using different encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entities, URL encoding).
        *   Payloads designed to trigger mXSS.
        *   Payloads attempting DOM clobbering.

### 2.4. Onebox and Embedded Content Vulnerabilities

Onebox (link previews) and embedded content (e.g., iframes) introduce external content into Discourse, creating a risk of XSS and other attacks.

*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   **Onebox Provider Vulnerabilities:**  The external websites providing Onebox previews may have XSS vulnerabilities.  Discourse must sanitize the content received from these providers.
    *   **iframe Sandboxing:**  Iframes should be properly sandboxed to prevent them from accessing the parent Discourse page.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP can help mitigate the risk of XSS from Onebox and embedded content.
    *   **Allowed Providers:**  Discourse administrators should carefully review and limit the list of allowed Onebox and embedding providers.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the `lib/oneboxer.rb` file (and related files).  This is where the Onebox logic resides.
    *   Analyze how Onebox content is fetched and sanitized.
    *   Check for proper iframe sandboxing.
    *   Review the CSP configuration.

*   **Fuzzing Targets:**
    *   Use links to websites known to have XSS vulnerabilities (or intentionally vulnerable test sites).
    *   Craft malicious Onebox payloads that attempt to bypass sanitization.
    *   Test different embedding scenarios (e.g., videos, social media posts).

### 2.5. Client-Side Sanitization Bypass

Even if server-side sanitization is robust, attackers may attempt to bypass client-side sanitization.

*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   **JavaScript Framework Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the JavaScript framework used by Discourse (e.g., Ember.js) can lead to XSS.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:**  Attackers may attempt to manipulate the DOM after the page has loaded to inject malicious code.
    *   **Bypassing CSP:**  Attackers may find ways to bypass the CSP, even if it is well-configured.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep the JavaScript framework and libraries up to date.
    *   Use a strong CSP.
    *   Avoid using `innerHTML` or other dangerous DOM manipulation methods.
    *   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies (Prioritized)

The following mitigation strategies are prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility:

1.  **Keep Discourse and Dependencies Updated (Highest Priority):**  This is the most crucial step.  Regularly update Discourse, the Markdown parser, the BBCode parser (if used), the HTML sanitization library, and all other dependencies.  Security updates often patch known vulnerabilities.

2.  **Robust Content Security Policy (CSP) (High Priority):**  Implement a strict CSP that limits the sources of scripts, styles, images, and other resources.  This can prevent XSS even if a sanitization bypass occurs.  Specifically:
    *   `script-src`:  Restrict to trusted sources (e.g., your own domain, CDN).  Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`.
    *   `style-src`:  Restrict to trusted sources.  Avoid `unsafe-inline`.
    *   `img-src`:  Restrict to trusted sources.
    *   `frame-src`:  Carefully control allowed iframe sources.  Use the `sandbox` attribute.
    *   `object-src`:  Generally, set to `'none'`.
    *   `base-uri`:  Set to `'self'` to prevent base tag hijacking.

3.  **Whitelist-Based HTML Sanitization (High Priority):**  If HTML input is allowed, use a strict whitelist approach.  Only allow a minimal set of safe HTML tags and attributes.  Use a well-vetted sanitization library (e.g., `Loofah`, `Sanitize`).

4.  **Fuzz Testing (High Priority):**  Regularly fuzz test the Markdown parser, BBCode parser (if used), and HTML sanitization logic.  Use a variety of fuzzing tools and payloads.

5.  **Disable HTML Input if Possible (Medium Priority):**  If HTML input is not essential, disable it completely.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.

6.  **Limit Custom BBCode and Markdown Extensions (Medium Priority):**  Carefully review and audit any custom BBCode or Markdown extensions.  Avoid adding extensions unless absolutely necessary.

7.  **Review and Update Allowed Onebox/Embedding Providers (Medium Priority):**  Regularly review the list of allowed Onebox and embedding providers.  Remove any providers that are not essential or are known to be insecure.

8.  **Code Review and Static Analysis (Medium Priority):**  Regularly conduct code reviews and static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Focus on areas where user input is processed and rendered.

9.  **Penetration Testing (Medium Priority):**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

10. **User Education (Low Priority):**  Educate users and administrators about the risks of XSS and other web vulnerabilities.  Encourage them to be cautious of links and content from untrusted sources.  While important, this is less effective than technical controls.

## 4. Conclusion

The "User-Generated Content (UGC) Sanitization Bypass" attack surface in Discourse is a complex and high-risk area.  By understanding the specific vulnerabilities, conducting thorough code reviews and testing, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS and other attacks.
