# Attack Surface Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Attack Surface: [User-Generated Content (UGC) Sanitization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/user-generated_content__ugc__sanitization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass Discourse's input sanitization to inject malicious code (XSS, HTML injection) via posts, comments, etc.
*   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse's rich text editor (Markdown, BBCode, potential HTML) and complex parsing, including Onebox and embedding, create a large attack surface.
*   **Example:** Crafted Markdown bypasses XSS filters, executing JavaScript in other users' browsers.  A malicious Onebox link injects XSS.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, data theft, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):** Update Discourse and libraries (especially Markdown parser).  Robust CSP.  Fuzz test input sanitization.  Whitelist allowed HTML (if enabled).  Sanitize Onebox/embedded content.
    *   **(Users/Admins):**  Disable HTML input if possible.  Limit custom BBCode.  Be cautious of links from untrusted users.  Review/update allowed Onebox/embedding providers.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin-Based Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin-based_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in installed Discourse plugins (official and third-party).
*   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse's plugin architecture allows extensive customization, but introduces risk if plugins are not vetted or updated. Plugins have API and database access.
*   **Example:**  A third-party plugin has SQL injection, allowing data extraction.  An official plugin has an unauthenticated API endpoint allowing setting modification.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, RCE, forum takeover, denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**  Security guidelines for plugin developers.  Plugin review process (if possible).  Sandboxing mechanisms (if feasible).
    *   **(Users/Admins):**  Only install plugins from trusted sources.  Vet plugins before installation (review code, check for vulnerabilities).  Keep plugins updated.  Disable unused plugins.  Monitor plugin activity.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Onebox](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_onebox.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers use Onebox (link previews) to make Discourse send requests to internal/external resources that should be inaccessible.
*   **How Discourse Contributes:**  Onebox inherently involves making external requests on behalf of the server.
*   **Example:**  A link to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` to retrieve AWS credentials.  Targeting an internal service on `http://localhost:8080/admin`.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal resources, cloud credentials, sensitive data; potential RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**  Strict allowlist for Onebox domains.  Dedicated network proxy with limited access.  Don't follow redirects to internal IPs.  Timeout requests quickly.
    *   **(Users/Admins):**  Review/update Onebox domain allowlist.  Disable Onebox if not needed.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to the Discourse API due to compromised API keys.
*   **How Discourse Contributes:**  Discourse relies heavily on its API.  API keys provide extensive access to data and functionality.
*   **Example:**  An API key is accidentally committed to a public repository and used to extract data or modify settings.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, forum takeover, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**  Documentation on secure API key management.  API key rotation features.  Granular API key permissions.
    *   **(Users/Admins):**  Store API keys securely (environment variables, not code).  Rotate API keys regularly.  Monitor API usage logs.  Use least privilege for API keys.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers upload malicious files disguised as legitimate images or other allowed types.
*   **How Discourse Contributes:**  Discourse allows file uploads; vulnerabilities in image processing or inadequate file type validation can be exploited.
*   **Example:**  A crafted image exploits ImageMagick, leading to RCE.  A `.php` file disguised as `.jpg` is executed by the web server.
*   **Impact:**  RCE, malware distribution, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**  Keep image processing libraries updated.  Validate file types rigorously (magic numbers, not extensions).  Store files outside web root.  Serve from a separate domain.
    *   **(Users/Admins):**  Limit allowed file types/sizes.  Use a virus scanner.  Configure file storage securely (private S3 bucket with signed URLs).

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Admin Account](./attack_surfaces/compromised_admin_account.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to an administrator account, granting them full control over the Discourse forum.
* **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse relies on administrator accounts for managing the forum, its settings, users, and content.
* **Example:** An attacker uses a phishing attack or password reuse to gain access to an admin account. They then deface the forum, delete content, or steal user data.
* **Impact:** Complete forum takeover, data breaches, reputational damage, service disruption.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **(Developers):** Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts. Implement and encourage the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts. Provide detailed audit logging of admin actions.
    * **(Users/Admins):** Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts. Enable MFA for all admin accounts. Regularly review admin activity logs. Limit the number of admin accounts to the absolute minimum necessary. Be vigilant against phishing attacks.
