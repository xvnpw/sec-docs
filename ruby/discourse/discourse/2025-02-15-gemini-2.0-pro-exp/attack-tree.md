## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access]]](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_administrative_access__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker; to obtain full administrative control over the Discourse instance.
*   **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over the forum, data, and users)
*   **Effort:** N/A
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Discourse-Specific Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_discourse-specific_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** Leveraging security flaws within the Discourse software itself (either core code or third-party plugins).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Vulnerabilities are discovered periodically)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly, from Intermediate to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Very Hard (Sophisticated exploits can be difficult to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Plugin Vuln]]](./attack_tree_paths/__plugin_vuln__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party plugins installed on the Discourse instance.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Plugins have varying levels of security)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to RCE, data breaches, etc.)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[[RCE]] (Remote Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/__rce____remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** A plugin vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Discourse instance.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on plugin quality and security practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Finding and exploiting an RCE usually requires significant effort)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (May be detected by intrusion detection systems, but sophisticated exploits can be stealthy)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Core Vuln]]](./attack_tree_paths/__core_vuln__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the core Discourse codebase.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Core is generally well-secured, but not impossible)
*   **Impact:** Very High (System-wide compromise)
*   **Effort:** High to Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[[SQLi]] (SQL Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/__sqli____sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Discourse core is generally well-secured against SQLi)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full database access, potential for data exfiltration and modification)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires finding a specific vulnerability in the core codebase)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Can be detected by WAFs and database monitoring, but sophisticated SQLi can be stealthy)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Auth Bypass]]](./attack_tree_paths/__auth_bypass__.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing Discourse's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access, potentially as an administrator.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Discourse's authentication mechanisms are generally robust)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct administrative access)
*   **Effort:** High to Very High (Requires deep understanding of Discourse's authentication flow)
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (Successful bypass may leave few traces)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise Admin Account Credentials]]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_admin_account_credentials__.md)

*   **Description:** Obtaining the username and password of a Discourse administrator account.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password strength and security practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct administrative access)
*   **Effort:** Varies greatly.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly, from Script Kiddie to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies greatly.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Brute Force]]](./attack_tree_paths/__brute_force__.md)

*   **Description:**  Attempting to guess the administrator's password by trying many different combinations.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Due to rate limiting, *unless* the password is very weak or a default)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Administrative access)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Automated tools can be used)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Rate limiting and failed login attempts are easily logged)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Phishing]]](./attack_tree_paths/__phishing__.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking the administrator into revealing their credentials through a deceptive email or website (e.g., a fake Discourse update notification).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the sophistication of the phishing attack and the user's awareness)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Administrative access)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Creating a convincing phishing email/page)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by email security gateways and user reporting)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Abuse Discourse Features/Configuration]](./attack_tree_paths/_abuse_discourse_featuresconfiguration_.md)

* **[Data Leak Leading to Auth]**
        * **[[API Key Leak]]**
            *   **Description:**  An API key with administrative privileges is accidentally exposed (e.g., in a public code repository, misconfigured plugin, or compromised server).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on how API keys are managed and stored)
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can grant administrative access via the API)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Using a leaked API key)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring API usage and identifying unauthorized requests)
        *   **[[Backup Exposure]]**
            *   **Description:**  A Discourse backup file (containing the database and configuration) is exposed to unauthorized access (e.g., through a misconfigured web server or publicly accessible storage).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires a significant misconfiguration or server compromise)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Full database and configuration access)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Downloading an exposed backup file)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring file access and network traffic)
