Okay, let's create a design document for the Discourse project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.  It aims to provide a clean, modern, and customizable forum solution for communities.  The business priorities revolve around:

*   User Engagement:  Maintaining a vibrant and active user base.
*   Community Health:  Providing tools to foster positive and constructive discussions.
*   Customization and Extensibility:  Allowing users to tailor the platform to their specific needs.
*   Reliability and Scalability:  Ensuring the platform can handle a large number of users and discussions.
*   Reputation: Maintaining a positive image as a secure and reliable platform.

Given these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Data Breach:  Leakage of user data (emails, private messages, etc.) could severely damage reputation and user trust.
*   Platform Abuse:  Spam, harassment, and other forms of abuse can degrade the user experience and community health.
*   Service Disruption:  Downtime or performance issues can frustrate users and drive them to other platforms.
*   Compromise of Administrative Accounts:  Attackers gaining administrative access could manipulate the platform, delete content, or ban users.
*   Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins:  Since Discourse is highly extensible, vulnerabilities in plugins could expose the core platform to risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the provided GitHub repository, here's an assessment of Discourse's security posture:

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Robust Authentication: Supports various authentication methods, including email/password, social logins (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and SSO. Implemented in the core application logic and various authentication plugins.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) system with different levels of permissions (e.g., regular users, moderators, administrators). Implemented in the core application logic.
*   security control: Input Validation: Extensive use of sanitization and validation to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other common web vulnerabilities. Implemented throughout the codebase, particularly in models and controllers.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Implemented to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks. Configurable in site settings.
*   security control: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Implemented using standard Rails mechanisms.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Implemented to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. Configurable in site settings.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Tests: While not explicitly documented in the repository, it's highly likely that a project of this scale undergoes regular security assessments.
*   security control: Secure Development Practices: The codebase demonstrates a strong focus on security, with consistent use of secure coding patterns.
*   security control: HTTPS Enforcement: Enforced by default.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Supported and encouraged for enhanced account security.
*   security control: Password Hashing: Uses strong, salted password hashing (BCrypt).
*   security control: Email Verification: New user accounts typically require email verification.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Dependence on Third-Party Libraries: Like any large project, Discourse relies on numerous third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Plugin Security: The security of third-party plugins is largely outside the control of the core Discourse team.
*   accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of security settings by administrators could expose the platform to risks.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:  As with any software, there's always the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for JavaScript and CSS assets to mitigate the risk of compromised CDNs or third-party scripts.
*   security control: Regularly review and update third-party dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Implement automated dependency scanning.
*   security control: Provide comprehensive security documentation and guidelines for plugin developers.
*   security control: Implement a robust security logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   security control: Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
    *   Provide options for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Securely store and manage user credentials.
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks.
    *   Implement secure session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   Enforce granular access control based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Prevent privilege escalation attacks.
    *   Ensure that users can only access data and functionality they are authorized to use.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user input on the server-side.
    *   Sanitize user input to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to input validation whenever possible.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.

## DEPLOYMENT

Discourse can be deployed in several ways:

1.  **Self-Hosted (Docker):** The recommended and most common approach.  Uses Docker Compose to orchestrate the various containers (web app, database, Redis, Sidekiq).
2.  **Self-Hosted (Manual Installation):**  Installing all dependencies and configuring the application manually on a server.  More complex and less recommended.
3.  **Cloud Providers (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, GCP):**  Deploying Discourse on cloud platforms using virtual machines or container services (e.g., AWS ECS, Kubernetes).
4.  **Hosted Services:** Using a managed Discourse hosting provider.

We'll describe the **Self-Hosted (Docker)** deployment in detail, as it's the official recommendation:

```mermaid

## BUILD

Discourse uses a combination of tools and processes for building and publishing the application:

1.  **Source Code Management:** Git (hosted on GitHub).
2.  **Dependency Management:** Bundler (for Ruby gems), Yarn (for JavaScript packages).
3.  **Build Automation:** Docker Compose is used to build the Docker images.  The `Dockerfile` defines the build steps for each container.
4.  **Testing:** RSpec (for Ruby code), QUnit (for JavaScript code).  Tests are run as part of the build process.
5.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** Discourse uses GitHub Actions for CI.  Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows`. These workflows automate tasks like running tests, building Docker images, and linting code.
6.  **Security Checks:**
    *   **Linters:** RuboCop (for Ruby code style and potential errors), ESLint (for JavaScript code style and potential errors).
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** While not explicitly shown in the workflows, it's common practice to use tools like `bundler-audit` (for Ruby gem vulnerabilities) and `npm audit` (for JavaScript package vulnerabilities) during the build process. These could be integrated into the CI pipeline.
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Tools like Brakeman (for Ruby on Rails security vulnerabilities) could be integrated into the CI pipeline to scan the codebase for potential security issues.
