# Threat Model Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An administrator with insufficient security awareness or a compromised administrator account could install a malicious plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin could contain arbitrary code that executes on the Discourse server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, or inject malicious content into the forum.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach (including user credentials, private messages, and forum content), defacement of the forum, and potential for further attacks on other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin system (`app/models/plugin.rb`, plugin loading mechanisms), potentially all parts of the application depending on the plugin's actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources (e.g., the official Discourse plugin repository).
        *   Thoroughly review the code of any third-party plugin before installation.
        *   Implement strict access controls for plugin installation and management.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a plugin vetting process or security scanning tools.

## Threat: [Markdown/BBCode Injection Leading to XSS](./threats/markdownbbcode_injection_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Threat:** Markdown/BBCode Injection Leading to XSS
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious post or user profile containing specially crafted Markdown or BBCode that bypasses Discourse's sanitization and allows the injection of client-side scripts (JavaScript). When other users view this content, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting them to phishing sites, or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), defacement of the forum for individual users, potential for spreading malware or phishing attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Markdown/BBCode parsing engine (`lib/markdown.rb`), potentially user profile rendering components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content.
        *   Use a well-vetted and regularly updated Markdown/BBCode parsing library.
        *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Regularly test for XSS vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual penetration testing.

## Threat: [Insecure Attachment Handling](./threats/insecure_attachment_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Attachment Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious file disguised as a legitimate file type (e.g., an image with embedded executable code) or exploit vulnerabilities in Discourse's file processing. If the server doesn't properly validate and sanitize uploaded files, this could lead to remote code execution on the server when the file is accessed or processed.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** File upload handling (`app/controllers/uploads_controller.rb`), attachment storage and retrieval mechanisms, potentially image processing libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        *   Scan uploaded files with antivirus software.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate domain or using a content delivery network (CDN) with appropriate security configurations.
        *   Limit the allowed file types and sizes.
