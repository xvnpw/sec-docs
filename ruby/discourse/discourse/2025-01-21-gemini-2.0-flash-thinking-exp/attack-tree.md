## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Discourse User Account Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_discourse_user_account_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing Discourse Accounts [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers use automated tools to try numerous username/password combinations to guess valid credentials.
    *   Credential stuffing involves using lists of previously compromised credentials from other breaches, hoping users reuse passwords.
    *   Success depends on weak password policies, lack of MFA, and users reusing passwords.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Session Hijacking of Discourse Users [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers aim to steal a valid user's session identifier (usually a cookie) to impersonate them without needing their login credentials.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit XSS in Discourse to steal session cookies:**
        *   Malicious JavaScript code is injected into Discourse (either persistently or via a crafted link).
        *   When a user views the malicious content, the script executes in their browser and sends their session cookie to the attacker.
*   **Social Engineering to Obtain Discourse Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers manipulate users into revealing their login credentials through deceptive tactics.
    *   Common methods include phishing emails mimicking legitimate Discourse notifications or login pages.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Discourse Content Manipulation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_discourse_content_manipulation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **Stored XSS via User-Generated Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Malicious scripts are permanently stored within the Discourse database (e.g., in forum posts, profile fields).
        *   When other users view this content, the script executes in their browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Discourse Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_discourse_pluginextension_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers leverage publicly known security flaws in Discourse plugins.
    *   This often involves using readily available exploit code to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Discourse API Vulnerabilities (If Application Integrates with Discourse API) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_discourse_api_vulnerabilities__if_application_integrates_with_discourse_api_ccd59cac.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authentication Bypass in Discourse API [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers find ways to bypass the API's authentication mechanisms, gaining access without proper credentials.
    *   This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication logic or using default/weak credentials.
*   **Authorization Flaws in Discourse API [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the API controls access to resources and actions.
    *   This allows them to perform actions or access data they are not authorized for.
*   **Data Injection/Manipulation via Discourse API [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers send malicious data through API requests to compromise the application or its data.
    *   This can include SQL injection (if the API interacts with a database) or other forms of data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Discourse Email Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_discourse_email_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Email Spoofing Leading to Account Takeover [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers forge the "From" address in emails to make them appear as if they are coming from a legitimate source (e.g., Discourse).
    *   This is often used to trick users into clicking malicious links or providing credentials through password reset workflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Discourse Webhook Vulnerabilities (If Application Uses Webhooks)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_discourse_webhook_vulnerabilities__if_application_uses_webhooks_.md)

*   **Webhook Injection/Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers craft malicious webhook requests and send them to the application's webhook endpoint.
    *   If the application doesn't properly verify the authenticity and content of webhooks, attackers can trigger unintended actions or inject malicious data.
