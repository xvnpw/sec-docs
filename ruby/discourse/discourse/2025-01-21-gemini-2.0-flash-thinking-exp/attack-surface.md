# Attack Surface Analysis for discourse/discourse

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Markdown Rendering](./attack_surfaces/malicious_markdown_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the way Discourse parses and renders user-supplied Markdown can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or other unintended behavior.
    *   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse uses a custom Markdown parser to format user-generated content in posts, topics, and private messages. Bugs in this parser can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a specific Markdown structure that, when rendered by Discourse, executes JavaScript in another user's browser (XSS). This could steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or defacement. Server-side vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Regularly update Discourse to benefit from security patches in the Markdown parser.
            *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for Markdown rendering.
            *   Consider using well-vetted and actively maintained Markdown parsing libraries if feasible.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugin Ecosystem](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugin_ecosystem.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party plugins can introduce vulnerabilities that affect the entire Discourse instance.
    *   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse has a plugin architecture that allows for extending its functionality. The security of the platform depends on the security of these plugins.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin has an SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to access or modify the Discourse database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privilege escalation, denial of service, remote code execution (depending on the plugin's permissions and vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement a robust plugin review process, including security audits.
            *   Provide clear guidelines and best practices for plugin development, emphasizing security.
            *   Consider sandboxing or limiting the permissions of plugins.
            *   Implement mechanisms for reporting and addressing plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
            *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
            *   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or maintained.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Discourse handles user-uploaded files can lead to malicious file execution or other security issues.
    *   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse allows users to upload files (e.g., images, attachments). Improper validation and storage of these files can create risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image. If Discourse doesn't properly sanitize the filename or storage location, this script could be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, defacement, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension.
            *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
            *   Use secure file storage mechanisms and avoid serving user-uploaded content from the same domain as the application.
            *   Implement antivirus scanning for uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure and Misuse](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure_and_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Exposed or poorly managed API keys can grant unauthorized access to Discourse functionalities.
    *   **How Discourse Contributes:** Discourse provides an API for integration with other services. API keys are used for authentication.
    *   **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository. An attacker finds this key and uses it to access and modify Discourse data or perform administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of content, potential for account takeover or administrative control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management).
            *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for API keys.
            *   Rotate API keys regularly.
            *   Educate users on the importance of keeping API keys secret.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Treat API keys as sensitive credentials.
            *   Avoid storing API keys in publicly accessible locations.
            *   Regularly review and revoke unused API keys.
