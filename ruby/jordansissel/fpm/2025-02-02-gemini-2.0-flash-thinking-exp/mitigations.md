# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Validate User-Provided Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_validate_user-provided_inputs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `fpm` Input Points:**  Pinpoint all locations where user-provided data is used as input to `fpm` commands. This includes command-line arguments passed to `fpm` (like `--name`, `--version`, `--description`, `--input-type`, `--output-type`, file paths, etc.), data read from configuration files that influence `fpm` behavior, and any environment variables used to configure `fpm` commands.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for `fpm` Inputs:** For each `fpm` input point, define strict validation rules based on `fpm`'s expected input formats and limitations. Consult `fpm` documentation to understand valid input types, formats, and any restrictions. For example, validate package names against allowed characters and lengths as per package format specifications, validate versions against semantic versioning, and ensure file paths are within allowed directories and formats.
    3.  **Implement Input Validation Before Calling `fpm`:** Integrate input validation checks into your application code *before* executing `fpm` commands. Use appropriate validation libraries or functions in your programming language to enforce the defined rules on the data intended to be passed to `fpm`.
    4.  **Handle Invalid Inputs and Prevent `fpm` Execution:**  Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs. When validation fails, reject the input, log the error with details (including the invalid input), and provide informative error messages.  Crucially, *prevent* the execution of the `fpm` command if input validation fails. Do not pass invalid data to `fpm` in any circumstance.
    5.  **Canonicalize Paths Passed to `fpm`:** When specifying file paths to `fpm` (e.g., using `--input-files`, `--directories`), use path canonicalization techniques *before* passing them to `fpm`. This resolves symbolic links and ensures that paths point to the intended locations within allowed directories, preventing path traversal attempts that could be exploited by `fpm` if it doesn't perform sufficient internal path sanitization.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via `fpm` Arguments (High Severity):** Malicious user input injected into `fpm` command-line arguments can be interpreted as commands by `fpm` or the underlying shell, leading to arbitrary command execution on the build system.
    *   **Path Traversal via `fpm` File Paths (High Severity):**  Unvalidated file paths provided to `fpm` can allow attackers to specify files outside of the intended build directory, potentially leading to `fpm` packaging sensitive system files or manipulating files outside the intended build context if `fpm` itself has path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed `fpm` Inputs (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously crafted inputs (e.g., extremely long strings, special characters in package names or descriptions) can cause `fpm` to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service of the packaging process.
    *   **Configuration Injection into `fpm` (Medium Severity):**  Manipulating `fpm` configuration options through unvalidated input could lead to unintended or insecure package configurations being generated by `fpm`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection via `fpm` Arguments:** High Reduction - Thorough input validation specifically targeting `fpm` arguments significantly reduces the risk of command injection by preventing malicious commands from being constructed and passed to `fpm`.
    *   **Path Traversal via `fpm` File Paths:** High Reduction - Path validation and canonicalization applied *before* passing paths to `fpm` effectively prevent path traversal vulnerabilities related to `fpm`'s file handling.
    *   **DoS via Malformed `fpm` Inputs:** Medium Reduction - Input validation can mitigate some input-based DoS attacks against `fpm` by rejecting malformed or excessively large inputs before they reach `fpm`, but might not prevent all DoS scenarios within `fpm` itself.
    *   **Configuration Injection into `fpm`:** High Reduction - Validating configuration-related inputs passed to `fpm` prevents attackers from manipulating package settings through input manipulation of `fpm`'s options.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic regex checks are used for package name and version validation before calling `fpm` in the application's packaging script.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing detailed validation for file paths provided to `fpm` (especially when specifying directories to include using `--directories` or similar options), descriptions, and other metadata fields passed as arguments to `fpm`.  Canonicalization of paths *before* passing them to `fpm` is not currently implemented. Validation of configuration file inputs that might influence `fpm` execution is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Script Execution during Package Build (via `fpm` options)](./mitigation_strategies/control_script_execution_during_package_build__via__fpm__options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Script Usage with `fpm`:**  Reduce the reliance on preinstall, postinstall, prerm, and postrm scripts within packages built by `fpm`. Explore alternative `fpm` options or configuration methods to achieve desired setup tasks without relying on external scripts. For example, use `fpm`'s built-in features for setting file permissions, ownership, or configuration file management instead of scripts where possible.
    2.  **Carefully Review Scripts Used with `fpm`:** If scripts are deemed necessary for package creation with `fpm`, carefully review and audit the content of these scripts *before* using them with `fpm`. Ensure they are written securely and follow secure coding practices. Avoid including or executing untrusted or dynamically generated code within these scripts that are passed to `fpm` for inclusion in packages.
    3.  **Static Analysis of `fpm` Package Scripts:** Perform static analysis on any package scripts that are intended to be used with `fpm` (and included in packages) to identify potential security vulnerabilities *before* using `fpm` to build the package. Use static analysis tools appropriate for the scripting language used (e.g., ShellCheck for shell scripts).
    4.  **Restrict Script Permissions within `fpm` (if possible):**  If `fpm` offers options to control the permissions under which package scripts are executed during installation, utilize these options to restrict script permissions to the minimum necessary. Avoid running scripts as root unless absolutely required and minimize the scope of root privileges even then. Consult `fpm` documentation for script execution permission controls.
    5.  **Avoid Passing Untrusted Scripts to `fpm`:** Never pass untrusted or externally sourced scripts to `fpm` for inclusion in packages without thorough security review and validation. Treat scripts used with `fpm` as critical components that can directly impact system security.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Package Scripts Included via `fpm` (High Severity):**  If malicious or compromised scripts are inadvertently or intentionally included in packages via `fpm`'s script inclusion mechanisms, these scripts can execute arbitrary code on the target system during package installation or removal, leading to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Package Scripts Handled by `fpm` (Medium Severity):**  Poorly written package scripts that are included via `fpm` can contain vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal) that can be exploited by attackers after package installation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Package Scripts Included via `fpm`:** High Reduction - Carefully controlling and reviewing scripts used with `fpm`, and minimizing their use in favor of `fpm`'s built-in features, significantly reduces the risk of malicious scripts being included in packages through `fpm`.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Package Scripts Handled by `fpm`:** Medium Reduction - Static analysis and secure coding practices for scripts intended for use with `fpm` help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in package scripts before they are packaged by `fpm`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Package scripts are used sparingly with `fpm`, and basic manual reviews are performed on scripts before using them with `fpm`. Static analysis and explicit permission controls within `fpm` for scripts are not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalized script review process specifically for scripts used with `fpm`, static analysis of these scripts, and investigation/implementation of any `fpm` options to restrict script execution permissions are missing.  Continued efforts to minimize script usage with `fpm` should be prioritized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure File Permissions in Packages (via `fpm` options)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_file_permissions_in_packages__via__fpm__options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Secure Default Permissions for `fpm` Packages:** Establish secure default file permissions for files and directories within packages generated by `fpm`, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Determine appropriate default permissions for different types of files (executables, configuration files, data files, directories) within your application packages.
    2.  **Configure `fpm` to Set Permissions Explicitly:** Utilize `fpm`'s command-line options or configuration settings to explicitly set file permissions during package creation. Consult `fpm` documentation for options like `--directories-mode`, `--files-mode`, `--config-files-mode`, and similar permission-related flags. Ensure that directories have appropriate execute permissions for traversal, and files have read/write permissions only where necessary.
    3.  **Use `fpm` Options to Set Ownership:**  Utilize `fpm` options to set appropriate ownership (user and group) for files and directories within packages. Use options like `--directories-owner`, `--files-owner`, `--directories-group`, `--files-group` to control ownership. Ensure that ownership aligns with the principle of least privilege and application security requirements.
    4.  **Avoid Overly Permissive Permissions in `fpm` Configurations:**  When configuring `fpm`'s permission settings, actively avoid setting overly permissive permissions like `777` (world-writable and executable) unless absolutely required and thoroughly justified by a specific security requirement.
    5.  **Regularly Review `fpm` Permission Configurations:** Periodically review the `fpm` configurations used for setting file permissions and ownership to ensure they remain secure, aligned with security best practices, and consistent with organizational security policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Package Files (Medium Severity):** Overly permissive file permissions set by `fpm` in generated packages can allow unauthorized users or processes on the target system to read, modify, or execute files within the installed package, potentially leading to information disclosure, data tampering, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Incorrect Package Permissions (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect file permissions on executables or configuration files within packages created by `fpm` can be exploited for privilege escalation attacks on the target system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Package Files:** Medium Reduction - Enforcing secure file permissions using `fpm`'s options significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to package files after installation.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Incorrect Package Permissions:** Medium Reduction - Correctly setting permissions using `fpm` helps prevent certain types of privilege escalation attacks related to file permissions within installed packages.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic default permissions are applied by `fpm` based on the system defaults, but explicit configuration of permissions and ownership using `fpm` options is not systematically performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A defined set of secure default permissions and ownership settings for packages needs to be established and then explicitly configured in `fpm` using its permission and ownership related options. Regular reviews of these `fpm` configurations should be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Obtain `fpm` Tool from Trusted Sources](./mitigation_strategies/obtain__fpm__tool_from_trusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Official and Trusted Sources for `fpm` Installation:**  Install the `fpm` tool exclusively from official and trusted sources. The primary trusted source is the official GitHub repository (`https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm`) for verifying releases and potentially building from source. Package managers of reputable Linux distributions (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`) are also generally considered trusted sources for pre-built `fpm` packages.
    2.  **Verify Integrity of `fpm` Downloads:** When downloading `fpm` from any source (even trusted ones), verify the integrity of the downloaded file using checksums or digital signatures provided by the source. For GitHub releases, check for signatures or checksums provided alongside release binaries. For package manager installations, rely on the package manager's built-in integrity verification mechanisms. Compare the downloaded file's checksum against the official checksum to ensure it hasn't been tampered with during download or distribution.
    3.  **Avoid Unofficial or Third-Party `fpm` Sources:**  Strictly avoid downloading or installing `fpm` from unofficial websites, third-party repositories, or file-sharing platforms. These sources may distribute compromised, backdoored, or outdated versions of the `fpm` tool.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised `fpm` Tool Itself (High Severity):**  Downloading `fpm` from untrusted sources significantly increases the risk of obtaining a compromised version of the tool. A compromised `fpm` tool could be backdoored to inject malicious code into generated packages *during the packaging process*, or compromise the build system itself when executed. This is a direct threat introduced by the source of the `fpm` tool.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting `fpm` Tool (Medium Severity):** Using untrusted sources for `fpm` can be a point of entry for supply chain attacks, where attackers distribute malicious software by compromising the distribution channels of tools like `fpm`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised `fpm` Tool Itself:** High Reduction - Obtaining `fpm` exclusively from trusted sources significantly reduces the risk of using a compromised `fpm` tool and thus reduces the risk of malicious packages being generated or the build system being compromised *by the `fpm` tool itself*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting `fpm` Tool:** Medium Reduction - Using trusted sources is a crucial step in mitigating supply chain risks specifically related to the `fpm` tool and ensuring the tool itself is not a source of compromise.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. `fpm` is installed using the system package manager (`apt`) which is considered a trusted source for system packages.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Currently implemented. However, it's important to periodically re-verify the source and installation method to ensure continued adherence to this strategy and to re-evaluate trust in the installation source if circumstances change.  Also, ensure that any updates to `fpm` are also sourced from trusted locations.
