# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the fpm project is to simplify and standardize the process of creating software packages for various operating systems and package formats.
  - Business priorities include:
    - Broad format support: Supporting a wide range of input and output package formats to cater to diverse platform needs.
    - Ease of use: Providing a user-friendly command-line interface and intuitive workflow for package creation.
    - Reliability and consistency: Ensuring that packages are built reliably and consistently across different environments.
    - Extensibility: Allowing users to extend fpm's functionality through plugins or custom configurations.

- Business Risks:
  - Package integrity compromise: Risk of malicious actors injecting malware or vulnerabilities into software packages during the packaging process.
  - Supply chain vulnerability: Risk of dependencies or build tools used by fpm being compromised, leading to compromised output packages.
  - Operational disruption: Risk of fpm tool itself becoming unavailable or malfunctioning, disrupting software release pipelines.
  - Reputational damage: Distribution of compromised packages can damage the reputation of the software vendor and the fpm project itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation - fpm likely performs some level of input validation to ensure provided files and configurations are valid for package creation. (Implemented within fpm codebase, details need to be analyzed).
  - security control: Checksum generation - Package formats often include checksums to verify package integrity after download. fpm likely generates these checksums as part of the package creation process. (Implemented within fpm codebase, part of package format standards).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Lack of package signing by default - fpm itself might not enforce or automate package signing, leaving it to the user to implement separately.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user-provided build environment security - fpm operates within the user's build environment, inheriting any security vulnerabilities present there.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement package signing: Integrate package signing capabilities into fpm to allow users to cryptographically sign packages, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
  - security control: Dependency scanning: Incorporate dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies used during the packaging process.
  - security control: Secure build environment guidelines: Provide guidelines and best practices for setting up secure build environments for fpm, including isolation and access control.
  - security control: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation: Generate SBOM for created packages to enhance transparency and allow for vulnerability tracking.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to fpm as a command-line tool. Authentication might be relevant in the context of a CI/CD pipeline or package repository integration where fpm is used.
  - Authorization:
    - Access control to the build environment where fpm is executed is crucial. Ensure only authorized users and processes can execute fpm and access sensitive resources like signing keys.
  - Input Validation:
    - Rigorous input validation is essential to prevent injection attacks and ensure the integrity of the generated packages. Validate all input parameters, file paths, and configuration options provided to fpm.
  - Cryptography:
    - Utilize cryptography for package signing to ensure package authenticity and integrity. Support strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
    - Employ checksums and hashing algorithms to verify the integrity of packages and their components.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software distribution to end-users.
  - Maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of software releases.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Software Packages: Publicly distributed, integrity is critical to prevent malware distribution (Medium Sensitivity - Integrity focused).
  - Build Environment: Contains build scripts, dependencies, potentially secrets (Medium Sensitivity - Confidentiality and Integrity).
  - Signing Keys (if implemented): Used to sign packages, compromise would allow malicious package signing (High Sensitivity - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
  - Source Code: Intellectual property, potential vulnerabilities if exposed (Medium Sensitivity - Confidentiality).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific package formats that fpm will be used to create?
  - What CI/CD system will be used to integrate fpm?
  - Are there any specific regulatory or compliance requirements for software packaging?
  - What is the process for managing and distributing package signing keys?
  - What level of security expertise is available within the team using fpm?

- Assumptions:
  - fpm will be used in a CI/CD pipeline for automated package creation.
  - Package signing is desired but not currently implemented.
  - Security is a concern, but the organization is still developing its security posture for software packaging.
  - The target deployment environment for packages is standard Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, Red Hat).
