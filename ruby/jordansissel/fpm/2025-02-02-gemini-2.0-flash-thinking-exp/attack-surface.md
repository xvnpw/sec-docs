# Attack Surface Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Input Parameters](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_input_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious shell commands by manipulating input parameters passed directly to the `fpm` command-line interface.
*   **How fpm contributes:** `fpm` relies on command-line arguments for configuration, including package names, versions, and descriptions. If these arguments are constructed using unsanitized external or user-provided data, `fpm` directly passes them to the underlying shell, creating a command injection vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   A script uses user input to define the package name: `fpm -s dir -t deb -n "webapp-${USER_INPUT}" ...`
    *   If `USER_INPUT` is maliciously crafted as  `; touch /tmp/pwned #`, the command becomes `fpm -s dir -t deb -n "webapp-"; touch /tmp/pwned # ...`.
    *   This results in the execution of `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system running `fpm`.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data loss, denial of service, unauthorized access to the build environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input parameters used in `fpm` commands, especially those originating from user input or external sources. Use allow-lists and escape shell-sensitive characters.
    *   **Parameterization (where possible):**  Avoid dynamic command construction. Use fixed parameters or safer methods for passing dynamic values if feasible.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Implement secure coding practices in scripts that generate `fpm` commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `fpm` processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Input File Handling](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_input_file_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in file paths provided as input to `fpm` to access files or directories outside the intended scope of the package.
*   **How fpm contributes:** `fpm` accepts file paths as input for source directories, files to include in packages, and for scripts. If `fpm` does not rigorously validate and sanitize these paths, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `fpm -s dir -t deb -C /app/webapp -f ../../../etc/shadow -n mypackage .`
    *   Intended to package files from `/app/webapp`, this command is manipulated to include `/etc/shadow` from the root directory using `../../../etc/shadow`.
    *   The attacker could then extract the Debian package and potentially access the sensitive `/etc/shadow` file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive files included in the package), unauthorized access to files on the build system, potential for package manipulation by including unintended files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Path Validation:**  Implement strict validation and sanitization of all input file paths provided to `fpm`. Use canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and remove `.` and `..` components.
    *   **Chroot Environment:**  Run `fpm` within a chroot environment to restrict its file system access to a designated directory, limiting the scope of path traversal exploits.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure `fpm` processes operate with minimal file system permissions, reducing the potential damage from path traversal.
    *   **Input Whitelisting:**  Define a whitelist of allowed input paths and reject any paths that fall outside this whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Handling of External Processes and Commands (Scripts)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_handling_of_external_processes_and_commands__scripts_.md)

*   **Description:** `fpm` executes external commands and scripts defined through options like `--before-install`, `--after-install`, and custom package scripts. If these commands or scripts are constructed unsafely, it can lead to command injection or exploitation of vulnerabilities in external tools executed by `fpm`.
*   **How fpm contributes:** `fpm`'s design includes features that allow execution of arbitrary shell commands during the package building and installation lifecycle. If the construction or content of these commands/scripts is not carefully managed, `fpm` facilitates the execution of malicious code.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `--before-install "echo 'Pre-install script for version: $PACKAGE_VERSION'"` where `$PACKAGE_VERSION` is derived from an external, potentially attacker-influenced source.
    *   If `$PACKAGE_VERSION` is set to `'; malicious_command #`, the executed command becomes `echo 'Pre-install script for version: '; malicious_command #`.
    *   This allows execution of `malicious_command` with the privileges of the `fpm` process during package installation.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution during package installation or removal, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction in Scripts:** Minimize or eliminate the dynamic construction of commands within `fpm` scripts, especially when using external or user-provided data.
    *   **Parameterization for Scripts:**  Pass dynamic data to scripts as arguments rather than embedding it directly into the script code to prevent injection.
    *   **Secure Scripting Practices:**  Ensure all scripts executed by `fpm` are written securely, following best practices to prevent command injection and other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis of Scripts:**  Use static analysis tools to scan scripts for potential security vulnerabilities before using them with `fpm`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Scripts:**  Run scripts with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Plugin Usage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_plugin_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or vulnerable `fpm` plugins can introduce significant security risks, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or compromising the build environment.
*   **How fpm contributes:** `fpm`'s plugin architecture allows extending its functionality, but using untrusted or poorly vetted plugins directly expands the attack surface of `fpm` itself. `fpm` loads and executes plugin code, inheriting any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior present in the plugin.
*   **Example:**
    *   A malicious `fpm` plugin could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data from the build environment, modify package contents to include backdoors, or execute arbitrary code on the build system during the packaging process.
    *   A vulnerable plugin, even if not intentionally malicious, could contain security flaws that are exploitable, leading to compromise of the build system.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, package manipulation (supply chain attacks), backdoors in generated packages.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the plugin's capabilities and vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting and Auditing:**  Thoroughly vet, audit, and review the source code and security of any `fpm` plugins before using them.
    *   **Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Only use plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources with a strong security track record.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  If possible, run plugins with restricted permissions or within a sandboxed environment to limit their potential impact.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Investigate and utilize any sandboxing or isolation mechanisms offered by `fpm` or the plugin ecosystem to limit plugin capabilities.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates and Security Monitoring:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions and monitor for security advisories related to `fpm` plugins.
