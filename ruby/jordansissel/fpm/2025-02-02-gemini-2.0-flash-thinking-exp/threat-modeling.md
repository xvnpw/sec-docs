# Threat Model Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Threat: [Compromised fpm Binary](./threats/compromised_fpm_binary.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised fpm Binary
    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `fpm` binary with a malicious one. This could happen through supply chain attacks or compromised download sources. When developers use this compromised `fpm` to package their application, the malicious binary injects malware into the resulting package.
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of malware to application users, leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities on user machines.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** `fpm` executable itself, core functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download `fpm` from official and trusted sources (e.g., GitHub releases, official package repositories).
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded `fpm` binary using checksums (SHA256, etc.) provided by the official source.
        *   Use package managers (like `apt`, `yum`, `brew`) to install `fpm` when possible, as they often provide integrity checks and updates from trusted repositories.
        *   Consider using a containerized or isolated build environment to limit the impact of a compromised tool.

## Threat: [Malicious fpm Dependencies](./threats/malicious_fpm_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious fpm Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of `fpm`.  `fpm` relies on Ruby and potentially other gems. If a malicious version of a gem is introduced into the Ruby ecosystem or the build environment, `fpm` might use it during package creation, leading to malicious code injection into the packaged application.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to compromised binary, this can lead to distribution of malware to application users and compromise of their systems.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** Dependency resolution and loading within `fpm` (Ruby gems).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a dependency lock file (e.g., `Gemfile.lock` in Ruby) to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates to potentially malicious versions.
        *   Regularly audit and update `fpm` dependencies.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to check `fpm` dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Source dependencies from trusted repositories and consider using private gem mirrors or repositories for better control.

## Threat: [Command Injection via fpm Arguments](./threats/command_injection_via_fpm_arguments.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via fpm Arguments
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization when constructing `fpm` commands. If parts of the `fpm` command (e.g., filenames, package metadata) are built dynamically from untrusted input, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, by crafting a filename that includes shell commands, they could execute arbitrary code on the build server during package creation.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to build process compromise, data breaches, or malicious modification of the application package.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** Command-line argument parsing and processing within `fpm`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing `fpm` commands dynamically from untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic input is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input before using it in `fpm` commands. Use parameterized commands or escaping mechanisms provided by the scripting language used to invoke `fpm`.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the build process user, limiting the impact of command injection.

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Secrets (via fpm packaging)](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_secrets__via_fpm_packaging_.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Secrets (via fpm packaging)
    *   **Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or database credentials within the files packaged by `fpm`. While not directly a vulnerability *in* `fpm` itself, `fpm`'s file inclusion mechanism becomes the vector for this issue. Misconfiguration or oversight in what files are provided to `fpm` for packaging leads to secrets being included in the final application package.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, or account compromise.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** `fpm`'s file inclusion mechanism, and developer practices in managing secrets during the packaging process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust secret management practices *specifically during the build and packaging process*. Do not store secrets directly in the codebase or configuration files that are packaged.
        *   Use environment variables, dedicated secret management tools, or configuration management systems to manage secrets *and ensure they are not inadvertently packaged*.
        *   Regularly scan the application codebase and *build artifacts* for accidentally committed secrets.
        *   *Thoroughly review the list of files and directories provided to `fpm` for packaging* before release to ensure no sensitive information is included.
