*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection via Arguments
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the command-line arguments passed to `fpm` to include malicious files or scripts within the generated package. This might involve crafting arguments that point to attacker-controlled resources or inject commands into archive creation processes.
    *   **Impact:**  The generated package will contain malicious content, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system upon installation or execution of the packaged application.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** Command-line argument parsing, package building logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully sanitize and validate all inputs used to construct the `fpm` command.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided data in `fpm` arguments without thorough validation.
        *   Implement strict access controls on systems where `fpm` commands are executed.
        *   Use parameterized commands or secure templating mechanisms when constructing `fpm` commands programmatically.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection via Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the system where `fpm` is executed could modify `fpm` configuration files to include malicious files or alter the packaging process to embed malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to argument injection, the generated package will be compromised, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** Configuration file parsing, package building logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on systems where `fpm` is installed and its configuration files reside.
        *   Regularly audit `fpm` configuration files for unauthorized modifications.
        *   Consider using configuration management tools to enforce desired configurations.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via External Command Execution
    *   **Description:** `fpm` relies on executing external commands for various packaging tasks. If `fpm` doesn't properly sanitize inputs when constructing these external commands, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with the privileges of the `fpm` process.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the build server or potentially on the target system during package installation if the injected commands are embedded within the package.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:**  Execution of external commands, input sanitization within `fpm`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `fpm` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Thoroughly review the `fpm` documentation to understand how it handles external commands.
        *   Avoid using `fpm` features that involve executing external commands with user-controlled data if possible.
        *   If external commands are necessary, ensure that inputs are strictly validated and sanitized before being passed to the command execution function.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Package Metadata
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially influence the package metadata (e.g., name, version, dependencies) through `fpm` configuration or arguments. This could be used to create packages that appear legitimate but contain malicious content or to cause dependency conflicts.
    *   **Impact:**  Supply chain attacks by creating seemingly valid packages that install malicious software. Confusion and potential installation of incorrect or vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Affected fpm Component:** Metadata handling, package generation logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict controls over the package building process and the source of truth for package metadata.
        *   Digitally sign packages after creation to ensure integrity and authenticity.
        *   Verify package metadata during installation or deployment processes.
