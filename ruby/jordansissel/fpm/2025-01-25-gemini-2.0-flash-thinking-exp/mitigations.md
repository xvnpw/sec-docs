## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for fpm Arguments](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_fpm_arguments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify fpm input points:** Pinpoint all locations in your packaging scripts or processes where user-controlled data is passed as arguments to the `fpm` command-line tool. This includes parameters like `--name`, `--version`, `--description`, `--input-type`, `--output-type`, file paths for `--input` and `--chdir`, and metadata options like `--vendor`, `--maintainer`, etc.
    2.  **Define validation rules specific to fpm:**  Consult the `fpm` documentation to understand the expected format and constraints for each argument. Create validation rules that match these expectations. For example, package names might have character restrictions, versions should follow semantic versioning, and file paths should be within allowed boundaries.
    3.  **Implement validation before fpm execution:**  In your packaging scripts, implement validation checks *before* executing the `fpm` command. Use scripting language features (e.g., regular expressions, string manipulation) to verify that user-provided inputs conform to the defined rules.
    4.  **Sanitize inputs for shell safety:**  Even after validation, sanitize inputs, especially file paths and metadata, to prevent command injection if `fpm` internally uses these values in shell commands.  Use shell escaping functions or parameterization techniques provided by your scripting language to ensure safe execution.
    5.  **Handle invalid input gracefully:** If validation fails, halt the packaging process immediately. Log the validation error with details about the invalid input. Provide informative error messages to developers or users to help them correct the input. Do not proceed with executing `fpm` with invalid arguments.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via fpm arguments (High Severity):**  Malicious input in `fpm` arguments could be interpreted as shell commands if `fpm` doesn't properly handle them internally, leading to arbitrary code execution on the build system.
    *   **Path Traversal via fpm file paths (Medium Severity):**  Unvalidated file paths provided to `fpm` (e.g., `--input`, `--chdir`) could allow attackers to specify paths outside the intended project directory, potentially including sensitive files or malicious code in the package.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against fpm (Medium Severity):**  Providing extremely long or malformed arguments to `fpm` could potentially cause it to crash or consume excessive resources, disrupting the packaging process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious commands from being injected through `fpm`'s argument processing.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized file access and inclusion by strictly controlling file paths used by `fpm`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately reduces the risk of `fpm` becoming unresponsive due to malformed inputs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial validation exists for package name and version using basic regular expressions in `bash` scripts before calling `fpm`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation for all relevant `fpm` arguments is missing, especially for file paths and metadata fields.
    *   Input sanitization specifically for shell safety when passing arguments to `fpm` is not consistently implemented.
    *   Robust error handling and logging for invalid `fpm` inputs are not fully in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed Input File Paths *Used by fpm*](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_input_file_paths_used_by_fpm.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define allowed source directories for fpm:** Clearly define the directories within your project that are intended to be used as input for `fpm`. This should typically be limited to the project's source code, assets, and necessary configuration files. Avoid allowing `fpm` to access the entire filesystem.
    2.  **Use `--chdir` and relative paths with fpm:** When invoking `fpm`, utilize the `--chdir` argument to explicitly set the working directory for `fpm` to the root of your allowed source directories.  Then, provide all input file paths to `fpm` using *relative paths* starting from this `--chdir` directory. This confines `fpm`'s file operations within the defined scope.
    3.  **Validate input paths against allowed directories:** In your packaging scripts, before calling `fpm`, validate that all file paths intended for inclusion in the package (passed via `--input` or other relevant `fpm` options) are indeed located within the pre-defined allowed source directories. Reject any paths that fall outside this scope.
    4.  **Avoid absolute paths with fpm:**  Strictly avoid using absolute file paths as arguments to `fpm`. Rely solely on relative paths in conjunction with `--chdir` to maintain control over `fpm`'s file access.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal Exploitation via fpm (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating file paths provided to `fpm` to access or include files from outside the intended project source directory, potentially leading to inclusion of sensitive data or malicious files in the package.
    *   **Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Files by fpm (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally packaging sensitive files that might be located outside the intended source directories if file path restrictions are not enforced for `fpm`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal Exploitation:** Significantly reduces the risk by effectively limiting `fpm`'s file access to the intended project scope through controlled working directory and relative paths.
    *   **Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Files:** Moderately reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks by restricting `fpm`'s operational scope.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `--chdir` is used in some build scripts, but not consistently across all packaging workflows.
    *   Relative paths are generally used, but explicit validation against allowed directories is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of `--chdir` across all `fpm` invocations.
    *   Validation logic to ensure all input paths for `fpm` are within allowed source directories.
    *   Enforcement to prevent the use of absolute paths with `fpm`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for User Running fpm](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_user_running_fpm.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated user for fpm execution:** Ensure that the `fpm` command and the entire packaging process are executed under a dedicated, non-privileged user account. This user should not be the root user or have unnecessary administrative privileges.
    2.  **Restrict file system permissions for fpm user:** Configure file system permissions so that the dedicated `fpm` user has only the *minimum* necessary permissions to perform its packaging tasks. This includes:
        *   **Read access:** Read access to the project source code and necessary configuration files within the allowed source directories.
        *   **Write access:** Write access to temporary directories used by `fpm` during the build process and to the designated output directory for the generated packages.
        *   **Limited execution permissions:** Only execution permissions for essential tools required by `fpm` within the isolated build environment.
    3.  **Avoid root execution of fpm:**  Never execute `fpm` as the root user. This is crucial to limit the potential damage if a vulnerability in `fpm` or the packaging process is exploited. If root privileges are accidentally or intentionally used, any compromise could have system-wide consequences.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation if fpm is compromised (High Severity):** If a vulnerability in `fpm` is exploited, running it with minimal privileges limits the attacker's ability to escalate privileges and gain root access to the build system.
    *   **System-Wide Damage from fpm Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Restricting privileges confines the potential impact of vulnerabilities in `fpm`. A compromised low-privilege `fpm` process has limited capabilities to harm the system compared to a compromised root process.
    *   **Accidental System Modification by fpm (Medium Severity):** Running `fpm` with least privilege reduces the risk of accidental or unintended modifications to the system due to misconfiguration or errors in the packaging process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the attacker's ability to gain higher privileges if `fpm` is compromised.
    *   **System-Wide Damage from Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of widespread damage by containing the impact of a potential `fpm` compromise.
    *   **Accidental System Modification:** Moderately reduces the risk of unintended system changes during packaging.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Build processes are run under a dedicated service account, but the level of privilege restriction might not be fully optimized for `fpm` specifically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed review and hardening of permissions for the service account running `fpm` to ensure strict adherence to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Formal documentation of the minimum required permissions for the `fpm` execution user.

## Mitigation Strategy: [fpm Version Management and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/fpm_version_management_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Pin a specific fpm version:** In your build environment configuration and packaging scripts, explicitly specify and pin a particular version of `fpm` to be used. Avoid using "latest" or rolling release versions in production packaging pipelines. This ensures consistency and predictability in your builds.
    2.  **Track fpm security advisories:** Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports of security issues in `fpm`. Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or use vulnerability scanning tools to stay informed about potential risks.
    3.  **Apply fpm updates promptly:** When security updates or patches are released for `fpm`, prioritize applying these updates to your build environment as quickly as possible.
    4.  **Test fpm updates before production:** Before deploying `fpm` updates to your production packaging pipelines, thoroughly test the updated version in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and stability and to verify that the update effectively addresses the reported vulnerabilities without introducing regressions.
    5.  **Verify fpm installation source:** When installing or updating `fpm`, always verify the source and integrity of the installation package. Use trusted repositories, official download sources, and verify checksums or digital signatures if available to prevent installation of compromised or backdoored versions of `fpm`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known fpm Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Using outdated versions of `fpm` with known security vulnerabilities exposes your build system and potentially your packaged applications to exploitation.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised fpm (High Severity):** If the `fpm` installation source is compromised, attackers could distribute backdoored versions of `fpm`, potentially injecting malware into your packages or compromising your build environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring you are using patched versions of `fpm` and mitigating known security flaws.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by verifying the integrity of the `fpm` installation and using trusted sources.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `fpm` version is specified in build environment setup scripts, but automatic update tracking and patching are not in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated tracking of `fpm` security advisories and vulnerability reports.
    *   Automated or streamlined process for applying `fpm` updates and patches.
    *   Formalized testing procedure for `fpm` updates before production deployment.
    *   Automated verification of `fpm` installation source and integrity.
