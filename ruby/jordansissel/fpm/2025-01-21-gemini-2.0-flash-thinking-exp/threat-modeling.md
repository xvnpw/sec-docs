# Threat Model Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in fpm Itself](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_fpm_itself.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `fpm` codebase. This might involve crafting specific inputs or manipulating the execution environment to trigger unintended behavior.
    * **How:** This could be achieved by providing specially crafted command-line arguments, configuration files, or input data that exposes a flaw in `fpm`'s logic.
**Impact:**
    * **Description:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution during the packaging process, allowing the attacker to compromise the build system or inject malicious code into the generated package. It could also lead to denial of service on the build system.
**Affected fpm Component:**
    * **Description:**  Could affect various modules depending on the specific vulnerability. Examples include **command-line argument parsing**, **input validation**, **package format handling** (e.g., DEB, RPM), or **external command execution**.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update `fpm` to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `fpm`.
    * Consider using alternative packaging tools if critical vulnerabilities are discovered and remain unpatched.
    * Run `fpm` in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution via fpm's Dependency Handling](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_via_fpm's_dependency_handling.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** If `fpm` is configured to fetch dependencies from external sources (e.g., RubyGems, PyPI) and doesn't have strict version pinning or integrity checks, an attacker could introduce a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency.
    * **How:** This relies on the attacker publishing a malicious package to a public repository that `fpm` might access before the legitimate one, or exploiting weaknesses in the dependency resolution process.
**Impact:**
    * **Description:** `fpm` could inadvertently include the malicious dependency in the generated package, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code on the target system.
**Affected fpm Component:**
    * **Description:** Primarily affects the **dependency resolution** and **package inclusion** logic within `fpm`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use dependency pinning or locking mechanisms to specify exact versions of dependencies.
    * Utilize private package repositories or mirrors for dependencies to reduce the risk of external interference.
    * Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification) for downloaded dependencies.
    * Carefully review and audit the dependencies included in the final package.

## Threat: [Command Injection via fpm Configuration or Input](./threats/command_injection_via_fpm_configuration_or_input.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** If `fpm`'s configuration or input allows for the execution of arbitrary commands (e.g., through shell commands specified in configuration files or through filenames with special characters), an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    * **How:** This could occur if `fpm` doesn't properly sanitize or escape input that is later used in shell commands or other system calls.
**Impact:**
    * **Description:** Successful command injection could lead to arbitrary code execution on the build system during the packaging process, potentially compromising the build environment or the generated package.
**Affected fpm Component:**
    * **Description:** Affects components responsible for **processing configuration files**, **handling filenames**, and **executing external commands**.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid using `fpm` features that involve direct execution of shell commands if possible.
    * Sanitize and validate any input that could be interpreted as a command by `fpm`.
    * Run the `fpm` process with the least privileges necessary.
    * Implement strict input validation for all configuration options and input files.
