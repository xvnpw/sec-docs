## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_manipulation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains control over the input files or data provided to the FPM tool during the package creation process. This can occur if the application allows external users or untrusted processes to supply these inputs without proper validation.
* **Potential Impact:**  This path can lead to the inclusion of malicious code, altered configurations, or the exploitation of file system vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in application compromise, privilege escalation, or full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Supply Malicious Input Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_supply_malicious_input_files.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides crafted files to FPM that contain malicious payloads or configurations. This is a critical entry point because it directly injects harmful elements into the application's package.
* **Potential Impact:**  This can lead to the deployment of backdoors, malware, or configuration changes that grant unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Manipulation -> Supply Malicious Input Files -> Include Backdoor/Malware in Package Content](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_manipulation_-_supply_malicious_input_files_-_include_backdoormalware_i_2b012917.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker embeds executable code (backdoors, malware, reverse shells) within files that are intended to be part of the application package.
* **Potential Impact:** Upon deployment, this malicious code can be executed, granting the attacker persistent access, control over the system, or the ability to perform further malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Manipulation -> Supply Malicious Input Files -> Include Configuration Files with Malicious Settings](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_manipulation_-_supply_malicious_input_files_-_include_configuration_fil_7d820e6c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker modifies configuration files that are included in the package. These modifications can alter the application's behavior, potentially creating backdoors, disabling security features, or granting unauthorized access.
* **Potential Impact:**  This can lead to application compromise, data breaches, or the ability to manipulate the application's functionality for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Manipulation -> Manipulate File Paths (Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_manipulation_-_manipulate_file_paths__path_traversal_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts input file paths with ".." sequences or other path traversal techniques. When FPM processes these paths, it can lead to files being written outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting critical system files.
* **Potential Impact:** This can result in privilege escalation, denial of service, or even full system compromise by corrupting essential system components.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit FPM Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_fpm_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits inherent security flaws or weaknesses within the FPM tool itself. This could involve vulnerabilities in FPM's code, its dependencies, or its handling of input.
* **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other security breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_command_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses external input or user-supplied data to construct commands that are executed by FPM without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious commands into this input, which will then be executed on the server with the privileges of the user running FPM.
* **Potential Impact:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit FPM Vulnerabilities -> Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_fpm_vulnerabilities_-_command_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  This is a specific instance of exploiting FPM vulnerabilities where the flaw lies in the insufficient sanitization of input used to build FPM commands.
* **Potential Impact:** As described above, this leads to arbitrary command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit FPM Vulnerabilities -> Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_fpm_vulnerabilities_-_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:** FPM relies on external libraries and dependencies (e.g., Ruby gems). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through FPM.
* **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it can range from code execution to information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Package Installation Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_package_installation_process.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets the steps involved in installing the package created by FPM. This can involve manipulating the package itself or exploiting the installation process.
* **Potential Impact:** This can lead to the execution of malicious code during installation, the installation of vulnerable software versions, or the introduction of malicious content into the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Malicious Pre/Post Install Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_prepost_install_scripts.md)

* **Attack Vector:** FPM allows the inclusion of pre-install and post-install scripts that are executed during the package deployment process. An attacker can inject malicious code into these scripts.
* **Potential Impact:** Because these scripts often run with elevated privileges, successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with high privileges on the target system during installation, leading to full compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Package Installation Process -> Malicious Pre/Post Install Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_package_installation_process_-_malicious_prepost_install_scripts.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is a specific instance of exploiting the package installation process by injecting malicious code into the pre-install or post-install scripts.
* **Potential Impact:** As described above, this leads to arbitrary code execution with potentially high privileges.
