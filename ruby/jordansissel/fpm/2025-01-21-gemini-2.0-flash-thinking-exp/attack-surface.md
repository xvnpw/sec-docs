# Attack Surface Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Input to `fpm` Arguments](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_input_to__fpm__arguments.md)

**Description:** `fpm` relies on command-line arguments to define package parameters, file paths, and build instructions. If these arguments are constructed dynamically from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` directly executes commands based on these arguments. If an attacker can control parts of these arguments, they can inject malicious commands.

**Example:** A script takes user input for the package version and uses it directly in the `fpm` command: `fpm -v $USER_INPUT ...`. If `USER_INPUT` is `; rm -rf /`, this could lead to the deletion of the entire filesystem on the build machine.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the build system, potentially leading to supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into the package.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize all input used to construct `fpm` command-line arguments.
*   Avoid constructing `fpm` commands dynamically from user input.
*   Use parameterized commands or escaping mechanisms provided by the shell or relevant libraries.
*   Enforce strict input validation on any data used to build `fpm` commands.

## Attack Surface: [Inclusion of Malicious Files in Packages](./attack_surfaces/inclusion_of_malicious_files_in_packages.md)

**Description:** `fpm` packages files and directories specified by the user. If the process of selecting these files is compromised or automated without proper checks, malicious files can be included in the final package.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` faithfully includes whatever files are pointed to by its input arguments. It doesn't inherently scan for malware.

**Example:** A compromised build script inadvertently includes a backdoor script in the `/opt/myapp/` directory, which is then packaged by `fpm`.

**Impact:** Distribution of malware to end-users, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict controls over the files and directories included in the package.
*   Use checksums or other integrity checks to verify the source of files being packaged.
*   Perform regular malware scans on the build environment and the files being packaged.
*   Employ a "least privilege" approach for the build process, limiting access to sensitive files.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Archive Extraction Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_archive_extraction_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** When using archive formats (like `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) as input, `fpm` extracts their contents. Specially crafted archives can exploit vulnerabilities in the extraction process, such as path traversal.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` relies on external tools or libraries for archive extraction. If these tools have vulnerabilities, `fpm` can become a vector for exploiting them.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious `.tar.gz` file containing filenames like `../../../etc/passwd`, which, when extracted by `fpm`, could overwrite system files.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file write on the build system, potentially leading to privilege escalation or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the archive extraction tools used by `fpm` are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid using untrusted archives as input for `fpm`.
*   If possible, use more secure methods for specifying input files instead of relying on archives.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Malicious Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_malicious_build_scripts.md)

**Description:** `fpm` allows the execution of pre-install, post-install, pre-uninstall, and post-uninstall scripts. If these scripts are not carefully reviewed or if their generation process is flawed, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` directly executes these scripts during the package installation/uninstallation process, often with elevated privileges.

**Example:** A dynamically generated post-install script contains a command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input used in its creation.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation or uninstallation, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review all build scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid dynamically generating build scripts based on untrusted input.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to the execution of build scripts.
*   Consider using configuration management tools instead of complex shell scripts for package configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Packages](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_packages.md)

**Description:** Incorrect configuration or usage of `fpm` can lead to the unintentional inclusion of sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, private keys) within the generated packages.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` packages whatever files and directories it is instructed to. It doesn't inherently filter out sensitive data.

**Example:** A developer accidentally includes a `.env` file containing database credentials in the files specified for packaging.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems or data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict controls over the files and directories included in the package.
*   Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to exclude sensitive files.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the application codebase or configuration files. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
*   Perform regular security audits of the packaging process to identify potential leaks of sensitive information.
