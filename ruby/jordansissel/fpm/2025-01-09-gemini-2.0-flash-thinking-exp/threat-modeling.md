# Threat Model Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Threat: [Malicious Package Content Injection via Input Manipulation](./threats/malicious_package_content_injection_via_input_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the input provided to `fpm` (e.g., source files, directories, package metadata) to inject malicious content into the generated package. This could involve adding backdoors, malware, or scripts that execute upon installation.

**Impact:** Compromised end-user systems upon package installation, potential data breaches, malware distribution, and reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Command Injection through Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_through_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input (e.g., within a filename or package description) that, when processed by `fpm`, is passed unsafely to an underlying shell command. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the `fpm` process.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the build system, potential for lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Generated Packages](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_generated_packages.md)

**Description:** `fpm` might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal paths) in the generated package if the input or configuration is not carefully managed. An attacker could extract this information by inspecting the package contents.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, and potential compromise of other services relying on the exposed credentials.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploitation of Critical Vulnerabilities in `fpm` Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_critical_vulnerabilities_in__fpm__itself.md)

**Description:** `fpm` itself might contain critical security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution flaws) that an attacker could exploit if the `fpm` process is exposed or processes untrusted input.

**Impact:** Compromise of the build system, potential for arbitrary code execution, and the ability to create malicious packages.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
