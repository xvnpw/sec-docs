# Attack Surface Analysis for jordansissel/fpm

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify `fpm`'s configuration files to inject malicious commands or alter package contents.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` relies on configuration files (often YAML or JSON) to define package metadata, dependencies, and build instructions. If these files are writable by unauthorized users or can be influenced through compromised systems, it creates an entry point for manipulation.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `fpm.yaml` file to include a `post_install` script that executes a reverse shell upon package installation.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation or removal, potential data exfiltration, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store `fpm` configuration files in version control and review changes carefully.
* Restrict write access to `fpm` configuration files to authorized users and processes only.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for configuration files.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secrets management.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `fpm` Arguments](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__fpm__arguments.md)

**Description:**  Improperly sanitized input used to construct `fpm` command-line arguments can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands.

**How fpm Contributes:** Applications might dynamically generate `fpm` commands based on user input or external data. If this data is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious shell commands.

**Example:** A web application uses user-provided package names to build a command like `fpm -s dir -t deb -n "user_input" ...`. A malicious user inputs `package; rm -rf /` as the package name.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running `fpm`, potentially leading to full system compromise, data loss, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid constructing `fpm` commands dynamically from user-provided or untrusted data.
* If dynamic command construction is necessary, use strict input validation and sanitization techniques (e.g., whitelisting allowed characters, escaping shell metacharacters).
* Use parameterized command execution methods if available in the scripting language.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Package Building](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_package_building.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided to `fpm` to include files outside the intended build context, potentially exposing sensitive information or overwriting system files.

**How fpm Contributes:** `fpm` takes file paths as input to determine which files and directories to include in the generated package. Insufficient validation of these paths can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker crafts an `fpm` command or configuration that includes files using relative paths like `../../../../etc/passwd` to include the system's password file in the package.

**Impact:** Inclusion of sensitive files in the package, potential for overwriting critical system files during package installation, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use absolute paths whenever possible when specifying files and directories for packaging.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths provided to `fpm`.
* Ensure that the build environment for `fpm` has appropriate file system permissions.
* Use `fpm`'s features to explicitly define the root directory for packaging.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Build Environment Secrets](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_build_environment_secrets.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information present in the build environment might be unintentionally included in the generated package or logged by `fpm`.

**How fpm Contributes:**  `fpm` executes commands and processes files within the build environment. If secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) are present as environment variables or in files, they could be inadvertently packaged or logged.

**Example:** An API key is set as an environment variable during the build process and `fpm` includes a configuration file that reads this environment variable into the final package.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services or systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing secrets directly in the build environment. Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Review `fpm` configurations and scripts to ensure they don't inadvertently include sensitive information.
* Sanitize `fpm` output and logs to prevent the leakage of sensitive data.
* Use temporary credentials for the build process that are revoked afterward.
