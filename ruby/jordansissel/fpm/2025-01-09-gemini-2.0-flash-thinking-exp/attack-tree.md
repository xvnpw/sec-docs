## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in FPM](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_fpm.md)

- This path focuses on how an attacker can manipulate the input provided to FPM to achieve code execution.
- It involves supplying malicious input, specifically through a crafted package definition file or by exploiting how FPM processes input leading to command injection.

  Critical Node: Crafted Package Definition File
  - Attackers create a malicious package definition file (e.g., Gemfile, requirements.txt) containing instructions to execute arbitrary code during the packaging process.

    Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Packaging Scripts (e.g., before_install, after_install)
    - Within the crafted package definition file, attackers insert malicious code into lifecycle scripts (e.g., `before_install`, `after_install`). When FPM builds the package, it executes these scripts, giving the attacker code execution on the server.

  Critical Node: Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities in FPM Internals
  - This involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within FPM's own code where it improperly handles input, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Execution Environment Vulnerabilities Introduced by FPM](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_execution_environment_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_fpm.md)

- This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how FPM interacts with the system during package creation.
- It involves injecting malicious commands into the packaging process or exploiting insecure permissions set by FPM.

  Critical Node: Inject Malicious Commands into Packaging Process
  - Attackers leverage the fact that FPM executes commands during package creation. By manipulating the packaging process (e.g., through environment variables or other means), they inject malicious commands that get executed.

  Critical Node: FPM Creates Packages with Insecure Permissions
  - FPM might create packages with overly permissive file permissions. After deployment, attackers can exploit these weak permissions to access sensitive files, escalate privileges, or compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using FPM](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fpm.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities in FPM to compromise the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious FPM Executes Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_fpm_executes_arbitrary_code.md)

- This scenario involves an attacker replacing the legitimate FPM binary with a malicious one. When this malicious FPM is used for packaging, it executes arbitrary code, directly compromising the application build process.
