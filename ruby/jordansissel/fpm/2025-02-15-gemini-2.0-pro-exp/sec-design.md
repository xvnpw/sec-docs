Okay, let's create a design document for the FPM (Effing Package Management) project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

FPM aims to simplify the process of building software packages for various operating systems and distributions (deb, rpm, gem, etc.). It targets developers and system administrators who need a streamlined way to package software without deep expertise in each packaging format's intricacies.

Business Priorities:

*   Ease of Use: Reduce the barrier to entry for package creation.
*   Cross-Platform Compatibility: Support a wide range of packaging formats.
*   Time Savings: Significantly decrease the time required to build packages.
*   Automation: Enable integration into CI/CD pipelines.
*   Community Adoption: Grow a user base and foster contributions.

Business Goals:

*   Become a go-to tool for rapid package creation.
*   Reduce the complexity of software distribution.
*   Enable developers to focus on code, not packaging.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security Vulnerabilities in Packages: FPM could be used to create and distribute packages containing vulnerabilities, leading to security breaches on systems where these packages are installed.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of the FPM build process or distribution channels could allow attackers to inject malicious code into packages.
*   Incorrect Package Metadata: FPM could generate packages with incorrect metadata (dependencies, versions, etc.), leading to installation failures or conflicts.
*   Lack of Maintainability: If FPM is not well-maintained, it could become obsolete or incompatible with newer versions of operating systems and packaging formats.
*   Reputational Damage: Security incidents or widespread usability issues could damage the project's reputation and hinder adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: The GitHub repository indicates the use of pull requests, suggesting that code reviews are part of the development process. (Described in GitHub pull request process)
*   security control: Community Scrutiny: As an open-source project, FPM benefits from community scrutiny, where users can report bugs and potential vulnerabilities. (Described in GitHub issues and discussions)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: User-Supplied Scripts: FPM allows users to provide custom scripts during the packaging process. This introduces the risk of malicious code execution if users are not careful.
*   accepted risk: Dependency on External Tools: FPM relies on external tools (like `rpmbuild`, `dpkg-deb`, etc.) for some of its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these tools could impact FPM.
*   accepted risk: Limited Input Validation: While FPM likely performs some input validation, the complexity of supporting various packaging formats may make comprehensive validation challenging.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the FPM codebase.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify and track dependencies, and to alert on known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
*   security control: Sandboxing: Execute user-provided scripts within a sandboxed environment to limit their potential impact on the system.
*   security control: Code Signing: Sign the FPM releases to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the FPM codebase and infrastructure.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to FPM itself, as it's a command-line tool. However, if FPM were to integrate with remote repositories or services, authentication would be required.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to FPM itself. However, if FPM were to manage package signing keys, authorization controls would be needed to restrict access to those keys.
*   Input Validation: FPM must validate user inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities and ensure that the generated packages are well-formed. This includes validating file paths, package names, versions, and other metadata.
*   Cryptography: If FPM handles sensitive data (e.g., package signing keys), it should use appropriate cryptographic algorithms and protocols to protect that data. FPM should support signing packages using established methods (e.g., GPG).

## DEPLOYMENT

FPM itself is typically installed as a Ruby gem.  The packages it creates are deployed using the native package management tools of the target operating system (apt, yum, gem, etc.).

Deployment Solutions:

1.  RubyGems Installation (for FPM itself): This is the standard way to install FPM.
2.  OS Package Manager (for packages created by FPM):  Packages created by FPM are deployed using `apt`, `yum`, `gem`, etc.
3.  Containerization (for FPM or applications packaged by FPM): FPM can be run inside a container, and it can also be used to create packages that are deployed within containers.

Chosen Solution (Detailed): RubyGems Installation and OS Package Manager Deployment

## BUILD

FPM's build process is primarily managed through its RubyGems packaging and the Rake build system.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Commits code --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- Triggers --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> Tests["Tests (RSpec)"]
    GitHubActions -- Builds --> FPMGemBuild["FPM Gem (Build)"]
    FPMGemBuild -- Pushes to --> RubyGemsDeploy["RubyGems.org (Deployment)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (or a similar CI system) is triggered.
3.  Tests (likely RSpec, based on the project's structure) are run.
4.  If tests pass, the FPM gem is built.  This likely involves using the `gem build` command and the `fpm.gemspec` file.
5.  The built gem is (potentially) pushed to RubyGems.org. This step might require manual intervention or be automated with credentials.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Version Control (Git): Tracks changes to the codebase and allows for auditing.
*   security control: Automated Testing (RSpec): Ensures that code changes do not introduce regressions.
*   security control: CI/CD (GitHub Actions): Automates the build and test process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Dependency Management (Bundler/Gemfile): Specifies and manages dependencies, allowing for tracking of versions and potential vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Integrate a SAST tool into the GitHub Actions workflow to scan the code for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Integrate an SCA tool to identify and track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Securely manage any credentials required for publishing the gem (e.g., using GitHub Actions secrets).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Software Packaging: The core process is creating software packages.  Failure here impacts the entire purpose of FPM.
*   Software Distribution:  While FPM doesn't directly distribute packages, it creates them.  Vulnerabilities in the created packages can impact downstream users.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code (Low Sensitivity): The source code of FPM itself is public.
*   User-Provided Input (Variable Sensitivity):  This includes scripts, file paths, and metadata.  The sensitivity depends on what the user is packaging.  Malicious input could lead to vulnerabilities.
*   Package Metadata (Medium Sensitivity): Incorrect metadata can lead to installation failures or dependency conflicts.
*   Generated Packages (Variable Sensitivity): The sensitivity of the generated package depends on the software being packaged.  A compromised package could contain malware.
*   Build Credentials (High Sensitivity): If FPM's build process uses credentials (e.g., for publishing to RubyGems), these are highly sensitive and must be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific external tools are used by each output builder?  Knowing this helps assess the risk associated with those tools.
*   Are there any plans to support package signing? If so, what mechanisms will be used?
*   What level of input validation is currently implemented?
*   Are there any existing security audits or penetration test reports for FPM?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by users?
*   Is there a specific threat model or risk assessment document already in place for FPM?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Assumes that FPM is primarily used by developers and system administrators who have a reasonable level of technical expertise.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Assumes that users are responsible for the security of their own systems and for the content they package using FPM. Assumes basic security practices are followed in the development process (e.g., code reviews).
*   DESIGN: Assumes that the core logic of FPM is written in Ruby. Assumes that the project structure on GitHub reflects the actual architecture of the tool. Assumes that GitHub Actions is the primary CI/CD system.
