# Attack Surface Analysis for puma/puma

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Puma Control App](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_puma_control_app.md)

*   **Description:** The Puma control application, when enabled, offers administrative control over the Puma server instance.  Lack of proper authentication and authorization exposes this control plane to unauthorized access.
*   **Puma Contribution:** Puma *directly provides* the control app feature and its configuration. Enabling it without robust security measures *directly creates* this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker, without any credentials, accesses the Puma control app via a publicly exposed port and uses the `/shutdown` endpoint to terminate the Puma server, causing a critical denial of service.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** Denial of Service (complete server shutdown), potential for server takeover if control app vulnerabilities exist (though less common, theoretically possible), information disclosure (server status and metrics).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exposed to untrusted networks and unauthenticated).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the Control App in Production:**  The most effective mitigation is to completely disable the control app in production environments if administrative control via HTTP is not required. Configure `control_app false` in Puma configuration.
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** If the control app is necessary, enforce strong authentication (e.g., using a strong, randomly generated `control_auth_token`) and restrict access based on authorization. Configure `control_auth_token` in Puma configuration.
    *   **Network Access Control:**  Restrict network access to the control app port (e.g., `control_url`) using firewalls or network segmentation to only allow access from trusted networks or localhost.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** When Puma is configured to terminate SSL/TLS, using weak or outdated configurations makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data interception. This directly compromises the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
*   **Puma Contribution:** Puma's configuration options (`ssl_bind`, `ssl_cipher_suites`, `ssl_min_version`, etc.) *directly control* the SSL/TLS settings when Puma handles TLS termination. Misconfiguration *directly leads* to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Puma is configured with outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLSv1.0) and weak cipher suites. An attacker exploits this weak configuration to downgrade the connection and intercept sensitive data transmitted between users and the application.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** Confidentiality breach (exposure of sensitive data in transit), Integrity compromise (potential data manipulation during transit), Compliance violations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong TLS Protocols:** Configure Puma to use only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.  Explicitly set `ssl_min_version: TLSv1_2` or higher in Puma configuration.
    *   **Utilize Strong Cipher Suites:**  Select a secure and modern set of cipher suites, explicitly excluding weak or vulnerable ciphers. Configure `ssl_cipher_suites` with recommended strong suites.
    *   **Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Enable HSTS in the application to instruct browsers to always connect via HTTPS, mitigating downgrade attacks. Configure HSTS headers in the application served by Puma.
    *   **Regularly Review and Update SSL/TLS Configuration:** Stay informed about best practices and emerging vulnerabilities related to SSL/TLS and update Puma's configuration accordingly. Use tools to assess SSL/TLS configuration strength.
    *   **Proper Certificate Management:** Ensure valid SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority are used and correctly configured in Puma (`ssl_cert`, `ssl_key`). Regularly renew certificates before expiry.
