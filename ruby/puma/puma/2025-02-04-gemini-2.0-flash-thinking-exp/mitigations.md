# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for puma/puma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_timeouts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Request Timeouts (`worker_timeout`, `shutdown_timeout`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Puma Configuration:** Open your Puma configuration file (usually `puma.rb` or `config/puma.rb`).
    2.  **Set `worker_timeout`:** Add or modify the `worker_timeout` setting. This defines the maximum time (in seconds) a worker process will wait for a request to complete before being forcefully terminated. Choose a value based on your application's typical response times, adding a buffer for occasional slower requests.  A common starting point is 60 seconds.
    3.  **Set `shutdown_timeout`:** Add or modify the `shutdown_timeout` setting. This defines the maximum time (in seconds) Puma will wait for workers to finish processing requests during a restart or shutdown.  A shorter value than `worker_timeout` is usually appropriate, like 5-10 seconds.
    4.  **Restart Puma:**  Restart your Puma server for the changes to take effect.
    5.  **Monitor:** Observe your application logs and performance after implementation to ensure timeouts are not occurring prematurely for legitimate requests and are effectively terminating long-running or stalled requests.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Slowloris Attacks (High Severity):**  By terminating connections that hold resources for too long, request timeouts mitigate slowloris attacks where attackers send slow, incomplete requests to exhaust server resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Runaway Requests (High Severity):** Prevents individual slow or stuck requests from consuming worker processes indefinitely, leading to denial of service for other users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Slowloris Attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the effectiveness of slowloris attacks by preventing resource starvation.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Runaway Requests (High Impact):**  Effectively prevents resource exhaustion from individual problematic requests, maintaining application availability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `worker_timeout` is set to 30 seconds in `config/puma.rb`. `shutdown_timeout` is not explicitly set and using default.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly set `shutdown_timeout` in `config/puma.rb` to a value like 5-10 seconds to ensure graceful shutdowns and faster restarts. Review and potentially adjust `worker_timeout` based on application performance monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Header Size](./mitigation_strategies/limit_header_size.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Header Size (`header_size`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Puma Configuration:** Open your Puma configuration file (`puma.rb` or `config/puma.rb`).
    2.  **Set `header_size`:** Add or modify the `header_size` setting. This defines the maximum size (in bytes) allowed for request headers.  A reasonable value is 8192 bytes (8KB), which is often sufficient for typical web requests.
    3.  **Restart Puma:** Restart your Puma server for the change to take effect.
    4.  **Test:** Test your application with requests containing large headers (e.g., large cookies or custom headers) to ensure the limit is not overly restrictive for legitimate use cases, while still preventing excessively large headers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Header-Based Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from sending requests with extremely large headers designed to consume excessive memory and potentially crash the server or degrade performance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Header-Based Denial of Service (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of memory exhaustion from oversized headers. The severity is medium because other DoS vectors might still exist, but this specifically addresses header-based attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. `header_size` is using Puma's default.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Add `header_size: 8192` to `config/puma.rb` to explicitly limit header size. Monitor application behavior after implementation to ensure no legitimate requests are being rejected due to header size limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Backlog Queue](./mitigation_strategies/manage_backlog_queue.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Manage Backlog Queue (`backlog`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Puma Configuration:** Open your Puma configuration file (`puma.rb` or `config/puma.rb`).
    2.  **Set `backlog`:** Add or modify the `backlog` setting. This defines the maximum number of connections that can be queued in the operating system's listen queue before Puma starts rejecting new connections.  A value of 2048 or 4096 is often a reasonable starting point for applications expecting moderate to high traffic.
    3.  **Restart Puma:** Restart your Puma server for the change to take effect.
    4.  **Monitor:** Monitor connection metrics and error logs, especially during peak traffic, to ensure the backlog is appropriately sized. If you see connection refused errors or excessive queuing, you might need to increase the backlog. However, avoid setting it excessively high.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connection-Based Denial of Service (Medium Severity):**  Limits the impact of attacks that attempt to flood the server with connection requests, potentially overwhelming the server's ability to accept new connections.
    *   **SYN Flood Attacks (Medium Severity):** While a reverse proxy is more effective, a limited backlog can offer some minor mitigation against SYN flood attacks by preventing excessive queuing at the Puma level.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Connection-Based Denial of Service (Medium Impact):** Reduces the server's vulnerability to connection floods. The impact is medium because a large backlog alone is not a complete solution for sophisticated DoS attacks.
    *   **SYN Flood Attacks (Low Impact):** Offers minimal protection against SYN floods; a dedicated firewall or reverse proxy is required for robust SYN flood mitigation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not explicitly implemented. `backlog` is using Puma's default.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Add `backlog: 2048` to `config/puma.rb`.  Evaluate traffic patterns and adjust the value if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Worker and Thread Count](./mitigation_strategies/control_worker_and_thread_count.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Worker and Thread Count (`workers`, `threads`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Puma Configuration:** Open your Puma configuration file (`puma.rb` or `config/puma.rb`).
    2.  **Configure `workers`:** Set the number of worker processes.  A common approach is to set this based on the number of CPU cores available on your server.  You can use `Integer(ENV['WEB_CONCURRENCY'] || 2)` to default to an environment variable or 2 workers if the variable is not set.
    3.  **Configure `threads`:** Set the minimum and maximum number of threads per worker.  The optimal number of threads depends on your application's I/O bound or CPU bound nature. For I/O bound applications, more threads might be beneficial. For CPU bound applications, fewer threads might be better to avoid context switching overhead. You can use `threads_count = Integer(ENV['RAILS_MAX_THREADS'] || 5)` and `threads threads_count, threads_count` to configure threads based on an environment variable or default to 5.
    4.  **Restart Puma:** Restart your Puma server for the changes to take effect.
    5.  **Performance Testing and Monitoring:**  Conduct load testing and monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory) under realistic traffic conditions. Adjust `workers` and `threads` based on performance testing and production monitoring to find the optimal balance between concurrency and resource consumption. Avoid over-provisioning, which can lead to resource exhaustion under attack.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Over-Provisioning (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidentally configuring Puma to use excessive resources, which could make the server more vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks or simply degrade performance under normal load.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Resource Starvation (Medium Severity):** By carefully controlling resource usage, you ensure resources are available to handle legitimate traffic and reduce the risk of denial of service due to resource starvation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Over-Provisioning (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of self-inflicted resource exhaustion by ensuring resource usage is aligned with server capacity.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Resource Starvation (Medium Impact):** Improves the server's ability to handle load and reduces the likelihood of denial of service due to resource starvation, though other DoS vectors are still possible.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `workers` and `threads` are configured using environment variables `WEB_CONCURRENCY` and `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` in `config/puma.rb`. Default values are in place if environment variables are not set.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Document the recommended values for `WEB_CONCURRENCY` and `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` based on server specifications and application characteristics. Regularly review and adjust these values based on performance monitoring and load testing results.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Puma Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_puma_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Puma Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (like Bundler for Ruby) to manage your project's dependencies, including Puma.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for updates to Puma. You can use `bundle outdated puma` in Ruby projects to check for outdated Puma versions.
    3.  **Update Puma Version:** When a new stable version of Puma is released, update your project's `Gemfile` (for Ruby projects) to use the latest version.
    4.  **Run Tests:** After updating Puma, run your application's test suite to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced any regressions.
    5.  **Deploy Updated Application:** Deploy the updated application with the latest Puma version to your environments.
    6.  **Monitor Security Announcements:** Subscribe to Puma's security mailing lists or monitor security advisories to be notified of any security vulnerabilities and promptly update Puma when necessary.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Puma Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated software is vulnerable to known security flaws. Keeping Puma updated mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in older versions of Puma.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Puma Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities by ensuring you are running a patched version of Puma.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency updates are performed periodically, but not on a strict schedule tied to Puma releases.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a process for regularly checking for Puma updates (e.g., monthly or upon security advisory releases). Integrate Puma update checks into the regular security maintenance schedule.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Puma as a Non-Privileged User](./mitigation_strategies/run_puma_as_a_non-privileged_user.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Run Puma as a Non-Privileged User
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Dedicated User:** Create a dedicated system user specifically for running the Puma process. This user should have minimal privileges required to run the application (e.g., read/write access to application files, log directories, and necessary network ports). Avoid using the root user or other highly privileged accounts.
    2.  **Configure Process Management:** Configure your process management system (e.g., systemd, Supervisord) to run the Puma process as the dedicated non-privileged user. Specify the user in the process management configuration.
    3.  **File Permissions:** Ensure that the dedicated user has appropriate file permissions to access necessary application files and directories, but restrict permissions to only what is strictly required.
    4.  **Verify User:** After configuration, verify that the Puma process is indeed running as the intended non-privileged user by checking the process owner using tools like `ps` or `top`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation after Puma Compromise (High Severity):** If Puma is compromised due to a vulnerability, running it as a non-privileged user limits the attacker's ability to escalate privileges and gain root access to the server or access sensitive system resources.
    *   **Lateral Movement after Puma Compromise (Medium Severity):** Restricting Puma's user privileges can limit the attacker's ability to move laterally to other parts of the system or network if Puma is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation after Puma Compromise (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the potential damage from a Puma compromise by limiting the attacker's privileges.
    *   **Lateral Movement after Puma Compromise (Medium Impact):** Reduces the attacker's ability to move laterally, though network segmentation and other security measures are also crucial for lateral movement prevention.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Puma is configured to run as a dedicated non-privileged user (`puma`) using systemd.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the `puma` user to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are not overly permissive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict File Permissions:** Set restrictive file permissions on Puma configuration files (`puma.rb`, `config/puma.rb`). Ensure that only the Puma process user and authorized administrators have read access. Prevent write access for unauthorized users. Use `chmod 600` or `chmod 640` to restrict permissions.
    2.  **Secure Storage:** Store configuration files in a secure location on the server, outside of publicly accessible web directories.
    3.  **Version Control:** If configuration files are version controlled, ensure that access to the version control system is also properly secured and audited.
    4.  **Secrets Management:** Avoid storing sensitive secrets (like API keys, database passwords) directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage secrets securely.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information (Medium Severity):**  Unsecured configuration files might contain sensitive information (like database credentials, API keys) that could be exposed if the files are accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):**  If configuration files are writable by unauthorized users, attackers could modify Puma's configuration to introduce backdoors, disable security features, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information stored in configuration files.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of Puma's configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. File permissions on `config/puma.rb` are set to `640`. Secrets are primarily managed using environment variables, but some less sensitive configuration might still be directly in the file.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a thorough review of `config/puma.rb` to ensure no sensitive secrets are directly embedded. Implement a more robust secrets management solution for all sensitive credentials. Enforce stricter file permissions (e.g., `600`) if possible, depending on deployment processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Puma Logs and Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_puma_logs_and_metrics.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Puma Logs and Metrics
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Logging:** Ensure Puma's access logs and error logs are enabled and configured to log relevant information (request details, errors, warnings).
    2.  **Centralized Logging:**  Implement centralized logging by forwarding Puma logs to a central logging system (like ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog). This makes it easier to analyze logs from multiple servers and detect security incidents.
    3.  **Metric Collection:**  Implement metric collection for Puma. Use tools like Prometheus, Datadog, or New Relic to collect performance metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, request latency, error rates, worker status).
    4.  **Alerting:** Set up alerts based on log patterns and metric thresholds. Configure alerts for error spikes, unusual request patterns, high latency, resource exhaustion, and other indicators of potential security issues or performance problems.
    5.  **Regular Log Review and Analysis:**  Regularly review and analyze Puma logs and metrics to identify suspicious activity, performance degradation, and potential security incidents.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response (High Severity):** Without proper monitoring, security incidents or performance issues might go undetected for extended periods, increasing the potential damage.
    *   **Lack of Visibility into Attacks (Medium Severity):** Monitoring provides visibility into attack attempts, allowing security teams to understand attack patterns and improve defenses.
    *   **Performance Degradation and Availability Issues (Medium Severity):** Monitoring helps detect performance degradation and availability issues early, allowing for proactive remediation before they impact users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the time to detect and respond to security incidents, minimizing potential damage.
    *   **Lack of Visibility into Attacks (High Impact):** Provides crucial visibility into attack attempts, enabling informed security responses and proactive defense improvements.
    *   **Performance Degradation and Availability Issues (High Impact):** Enables proactive identification and resolution of performance issues, improving application stability and availability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Puma access and error logs are enabled and written to files. Basic server metrics are collected by infrastructure monitoring tools.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement centralized logging by forwarding Puma logs to a central logging system. Set up specific alerts for Puma-related errors and performance metrics within the monitoring system. Implement more comprehensive Puma-specific metrics collection (e.g., worker status, thread pool utilization). Establish a regular schedule for log review and analysis.
