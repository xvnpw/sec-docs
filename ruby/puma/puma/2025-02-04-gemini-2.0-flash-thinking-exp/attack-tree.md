## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Crafted HTTP requests with "../" sequences in the URI.
*   Exploiting misconfiguration of static file serving in Puma or the application.
*   **Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the intended webroot.
*   Disclosure of configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other confidential data.
*   **Mitigation:**
*   Disable static file serving if not required.
*   Carefully configure the `root` directory for static file serving.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent "../" sequences in URIs.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Slowloris Attack (CPU Exhaustion):**
    *   Sending slow, incomplete HTTP requests to keep Puma worker threads busy indefinitely.
*   **Request Flooding (CPU Exhaustion):**
    *   Sending a large volume of valid or slightly invalid HTTP requests to overwhelm Puma's processing capacity.
*   **Large Request Bodies (Memory Exhaustion):**
    *   Sending requests with excessively large bodies to consume server memory and potentially crash Puma.
*   **Connection Exhaustion (Memory Exhaustion):**
    *   Opening a large number of connections and keeping them alive to exhaust Puma's connection limits and server resources.
*   **Impact:**
*   Application unavailability and downtime.
*   Resource exhaustion leading to server instability.
*   Reputational damage and financial losses.
*   **Mitigation:**
*   Implement rate limiting at the application or infrastructure level (e.g., WAF, load balancer).
*   Configure request size limits in Puma.
*   Set appropriate connection limits in Puma and the operating system.
*   Use timeout settings to prevent slow requests from holding resources.
*   Deploy load balancing and auto-scaling infrastructure.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for resource usage and connection counts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Weak Ciphers:**
    *   Exploiting weak ciphers allowed by Puma configuration to perform downgrade attacks and eavesdropping.
*   **Outdated TLS Protocols:**
    *   Forcing protocol downgrade to older, vulnerable TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, 1.1) to exploit known TLS vulnerabilities.
*   **Misconfigured Certificates:**
    *   Exploiting expired or self-signed certificates to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by intercepting and decrypting traffic.
*   **Impact:**
*   Confidentiality breach and exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
*   Man-in-the-Middle attacks allowing attackers to intercept, modify, or inject data into communications.
*   Compromise of user credentials and session hijacking.
*   **Mitigation:**
*   Configure Puma to use strong ciphers and the latest TLS protocols (TLS 1.3 recommended, TLS 1.2 minimum).
*   Disable weak ciphers and outdated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).
*   Regularly update SSL/TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL).
*   Use valid, properly issued SSL/TLS certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities.
*   Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
*   Regularly audit SSL/TLS configuration using security scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Puma Dependencies Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_puma_dependencies_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Rack Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Rack web server interface library, which Puma uses.
*   **Ruby Interpreter Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Ruby interpreter that Puma is running on.
*   **Gem Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in other Ruby gems used by the application or Puma indirectly. This includes both direct and transitive dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
*   Code execution on the server.
*   Information disclosure and data breaches.
*   Denial of Service.
*   Full system compromise depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:**
*   Regularly update Rack, Ruby interpreter, and all gem dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`, Snyk, Gemnasium) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
*   Implement automated dependency updates and vulnerability monitoring.
*   Minimize the number of dependencies and follow the principle of least privilege for dependencies.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for Rack, Ruby, and relevant gems.
