# Threat Model Analysis for puma/puma

## Threat: [Insecure Puma Configuration](./threats/insecure_puma_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in Puma to compromise the application or server. Running Puma as root allows system-level compromise if Puma is vulnerable. Exposing `pumactl` without authentication grants remote control over Puma, enabling attackers to stop, restart, or manipulate the application. Weak secrets for features like phased restarts can be brute-forced, leading to unauthorized control. Insecure SSL/TLS settings expose sensitive data to interception. Insufficient resource limits enable denial of service attacks by exhausting server resources.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise (if running as root), unauthorized application control, denial of service, data interception, application downtime, potential data breach.
*   **Puma Component Affected:** Configuration loading, process management, `pumactl` control server, SSL/TLS handling, resource management (threads, workers).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially**, run Puma as a non-privileged user.
    *   **Secure `pumactl` access**: bind to localhost, use strong authentication if remote access is required, restrict network access.
    *   **Generate and use strong, unique secrets** for all Puma features requiring them (e.g., phased restarts).
    *   **Implement robust SSL/TLS configuration** with strong ciphers, protocols, and proper certificate management.
    *   **Carefully tune resource limits** based on application needs and expected traffic to prevent resource exhaustion DoS.
    *   **Regularly audit and review Puma configuration** against security best practices.

## Threat: [Exposure of Puma Control Server](./threats/exposure_of_puma_control_server.md)

*   **Description:**  If the Puma control server (`pumactl`) is accessible over a network without proper authentication, attackers can remotely execute administrative commands. This allows them to stop the Puma server, restart it (potentially with malicious configurations), request thread dumps to gather sensitive information from memory, or trigger phased restarts for disruptive purposes.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Puma process, denial of service, information disclosure (via thread dumps revealing application secrets or data in memory), potential for application compromise through malicious restarts or configuration changes.
*   **Puma Component Affected:** `pumactl` control server, command processing, process management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bind the control server to localhost (127.0.0.1)** as the primary and safest configuration.
    *   **If remote access is absolutely necessary**, implement **strong authentication** (using a secret token) and **enforce TLS encryption** for all control server communication.
    *   **Strictly restrict network access** to the control server using firewalls and network segmentation, allowing only authorized and necessary IPs or networks.
    *   **Regularly rotate control server secrets** to limit the window of opportunity if a secret is compromised.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Thread/Worker Starvation)](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion__threadworker_starvation_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can intentionally flood the Puma server with requests or send slow, resource-intensive requests to exhaust Puma's thread and worker pool. This prevents Puma from processing legitimate requests, leading to a denial of service. Slow clients or requests designed to hold threads for extended periods amplify this threat.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability, service outage, negative impact on users and business operations.
*   **Puma Component Affected:** Thread pool management, worker management, request handling, connection handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly tune Puma's worker and thread pool configuration** based on application performance testing and expected traffic volume.
    *   **Implement request timeouts** to forcefully terminate long-running requests that are tying up resources.
    *   **Utilize request queuing mechanisms** (if available in your application framework or middleware) to buffer and manage request surges gracefully.
    *   **Deploy rate limiting and request throttling** at the application or infrastructure level to actively block or slow down abusive traffic patterns.
    *   **Implement robust monitoring of Puma's thread and worker utilization** and set up **proactive alerts** to detect and respond to resource exhaustion conditions in real-time.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Puma's Process Management (Clustering, Phased Restarts)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_puma's_process_management__clustering__phased_restarts_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities within Puma's clustering or phased restart features could allow attackers to disrupt service or potentially gain unauthorized privileges. This might involve manipulating signals used for inter-process communication, exploiting race conditions during process restarts, or leveraging weaknesses in how Puma manages worker processes. Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, application instability, or in severe cases, local privilege escalation if vulnerabilities exist in signal handling or process spawning logic within Puma itself.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, unexpected behavior, potential local privilege escalation (though less common, a critical impact if it occurs), potential for container escape in containerized environments depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Puma Component Affected:** Clustering module, phased restart mechanism, signal handling, process management, inter-process communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Puma at the latest stable version** to ensure timely application of security patches addressing process management vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exercise caution and thoroughly understand the security implications** before enabling and using clustering and phased restarts, especially in high-security environments.
    *   **Strictly adhere to Puma's documented best practices** for configuring and managing clusters and restarts securely, minimizing potential misconfigurations.
    *   **Conduct rigorous security testing and audits**, particularly focusing on process management aspects, especially in security-sensitive deployments.
