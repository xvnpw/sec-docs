# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Puma web server, aims to provide a robust, high-performance, and concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby applications. Puma is designed to be easy to use and deploy, making it a popular choice for Ruby on Rails and other Rack-based applications.

Business priorities and goals:
- High Performance: Serve web requests quickly and efficiently to ensure a responsive user experience.
- Concurrency: Handle multiple requests simultaneously to maximize resource utilization and throughput.
- Reliability: Provide stable and dependable service with minimal downtime.
- Ease of Use: Simplify configuration and deployment for developers and operators.
- Community Support: Maintain an active and supportive community to ensure ongoing development and issue resolution.

Most important business risks:
- Performance Degradation: Inability to handle increasing traffic or complex requests, leading to slow response times and poor user experience.
- Downtime: Server crashes or failures resulting in application unavailability and business disruption.
- Security Vulnerabilities: Exploitable weaknesses in Puma or its dependencies that could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.
- Compatibility Issues: Problems arising from incompatibility with specific Ruby versions, libraries, or deployment environments.
- Maintainability Challenges: Difficulties in updating, patching, or extending Puma due to code complexity or lack of documentation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Dependency Management: Puma uses Bundler to manage dependencies, helping to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. Described in `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.
- security control: Regular Updates: The Puma project actively maintains the server and releases updates, including security patches. Evident from the project's commit history and release notes on GitHub.
- security control: Input Validation (Limited): Puma handles HTTP requests and performs basic parsing, which includes some implicit input validation at the HTTP protocol level. Implemented within Puma's core request handling logic.
- security control: TLS/SSL Support: Puma supports TLS/SSL for encrypted communication over HTTPS. Configurable via Puma configuration settings.
- security control: Configuration Hardening: Puma allows configuration options to limit resource usage and enhance security, such as setting worker timeouts and thread limits. Configurable via `puma.rb` configuration file or command-line options.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: Reliance on third-party gems introduces potential vulnerabilities in dependencies. Mitigated by dependency management and regular updates, but residual risk remains.
- accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of Puma settings can lead to security weaknesses or performance issues. User responsibility to configure securely.
- accepted risk: Application Layer Vulnerabilities: Puma is a web server and does not protect against vulnerabilities in the Ruby application it serves. Application security is the responsibility of the application developers.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the Puma development and release pipeline to automatically identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Implement SCA tools to continuously monitor Puma's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the Puma codebase by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- security control: Secure Defaults: Review and enhance Puma's default configuration to promote secure settings out-of-the-box.
- security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) and other security headers: Encourage and document the use of security headers in applications served by Puma to mitigate client-side vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Puma itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication is expected to be implemented at the application layer.
- Authorization: Puma itself does not handle user authorization. Authorization is expected to be implemented at the application layer.
- Input Validation: Puma performs basic HTTP request parsing. Applications using Puma must implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Puma supports TLS/SSL for encrypted communication. Applications should enforce HTTPS and utilize strong TLS configurations. Applications may also need to implement application-level cryptography for data protection, which is outside of Puma's scope.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Running web applications and serving content to end-users. Availability and performance of these applications are critical for business operations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Application Data: Data processed and stored by the web applications served by Puma. Sensitivity depends on the specific application (could be highly sensitive PII, financial data, or less sensitive public information).
- Access Logs: Logs generated by Puma and the application, which may contain user IP addresses, request paths, and other potentially sensitive information. Medium sensitivity.
- Configuration Data: Puma configuration files, TLS/SSL certificates, and database credentials. High sensitivity.
- Application Code: Source code of the web application. Medium to high sensitivity (intellectual property, potential vulnerabilities).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of web applications will be served by Puma? (e.g., public website, internal application, API). This will influence the sensitivity of data and specific security requirements.
- What is the expected traffic volume and performance requirements for the web applications? This will impact scalability and performance considerations.
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that need to be met? This will dictate specific security controls and data protection measures.
- What is the organization's risk appetite? This will influence the balance between security controls, cost, and performance.
- What existing security infrastructure and tools are already in place? This will help to integrate Puma security measures with the overall security architecture.

Assumptions:
- Puma will be deployed in a containerized environment using Kubernetes on a cloud platform.
- Web applications served by Puma will handle user data, and therefore security is a significant concern.
- Standard web application security best practices will be applied at the application layer.
- The organization has a basic understanding of cloud security and container security principles.
- The build process utilizes GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
