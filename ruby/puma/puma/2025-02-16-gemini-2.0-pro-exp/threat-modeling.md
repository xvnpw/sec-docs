# Threat Model Analysis for puma/puma

## Threat: [Threat: Insecure Direct Exposure](./threats/threat_insecure_direct_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker directly accesses the Puma server because it's exposed to the public internet *without* a reverse proxy.  This bypasses *all* external security measures, making Puma directly vulnerable to *any* attack it's not designed to handle on its own.  This is a *configuration* issue, but it directly impacts Puma.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to *all* attacks (DoS, exploitation of any Puma vulnerabilities, etc.).  High potential for data breaches and complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire Puma server and the application it serves.  Puma's network binding configuration is directly at fault.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (significantly increases attack surface and bypasses crucial protections).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reverse Proxy (Mandatory):** *Always* use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, HAProxy) in front of Puma in production. This is non-negotiable.
    *   **Binding Address:** Configure Puma to bind *only* to localhost (127.0.0.1) or a private network interface, *never* to a public IP address or `0.0.0.0`. This is a *direct* Puma configuration change.

## Threat: [Threat: Unsecured Control/Status Endpoint](./threats/threat_unsecured_controlstatus_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses Puma's control/status endpoint (if enabled via `control_url`) without proper authentication.  This endpoint can expose internal metrics and, *crucially*, potentially allow the attacker to *control* Puma (e.g., restart workers, potentially influence its behavior). This is a direct configuration issue within Puma.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (Puma's internal state, potentially revealing sensitive details).  Potential for denial of service (if the attacker can restart workers or disrupt their operation).  Possible privilege escalation (depending on the control endpoint's capabilities and how it interacts with the underlying system).
*   **Affected Component:** Puma's `control_url` and related control/status functionality (the code that implements this feature).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if enabled and exposed; potential for control and information disclosure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable in Production:** Disable the `control_url` option in Puma's configuration file in production if it's not *absolutely* necessary. This is the best mitigation.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** If the `control_url` *must* be used, secure it with *strong* authentication (e.g., a complex, unique password or token). This is a *direct* Puma configuration change.
    *   **IP Restriction:** Restrict access to the `control_url` to *only* trusted IP addresses. This is also a direct Puma configuration change (or can be done at the firewall level).

## Threat: [Threat: Puma/Dependency Vulnerability (RCE or Severe DoS)](./threats/threat_pumadependency_vulnerability__rce_or_severe_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *known or zero-day vulnerability* in Puma *itself* or one of its *core* dependencies (e.g., `nio4r`, a low-level component like a C extension used for network I/O) that leads to *Remote Code Execution (RCE)* or a *severe, easily exploitable Denial of Service*. This is distinct from application-level vulnerabilities. We're focusing on vulnerabilities *within* Puma's codebase or its tightly coupled dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but *specifically* focusing on RCE (complete system compromise) or a DoS vulnerability that is *easily* triggered and *highly* impactful, directly affecting Puma's core functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component *within* Puma or its *core* dependencies (e.g., a flaw in the HTTP parsing logic, a buffer overflow in `nio4r`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE) or High (for severe, easily exploitable DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates (Primary):** Keep Puma and all its dependencies (especially low-level ones like `nio4r`) updated to the *latest* versions. This is the *most* important mitigation. Use a dependency manager (Bundler) and check for updates frequently.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools that specifically target Ruby and its dependencies, looking for known vulnerabilities in Puma and its core components.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and mailing lists for Puma and its related projects (including the Ruby security advisories). Be prepared to apply patches *immediately*.

## Threat: [Threat: Supply Chain Attack (targeting Puma directly)](./threats/threat_supply_chain_attack__targeting_puma_directly_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the *Puma gem repository itself* or a *very closely tied dependency* (like `nio4r`), injecting malicious code *specifically* designed to exploit Puma or the systems it runs on. This is distinct from a general supply chain attack; it's targeted at Puma users.
*   **Impact:** Potentially severe, ranging from data exfiltration to complete system compromise (RCE). The attacker gains control over applications using the compromised Puma or its core dependency.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire application, as the compromised code within Puma or its core dependency would be executed.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (can lead to complete system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Signing (Ideal):** If Puma and its core dependencies were cryptographically signed, verify the signatures before installation. This is the strongest defense, but relies on the maintainers implementing signing.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Employ SCA tools to identify and mitigate supply chain risks, *specifically* focusing on Puma and its *core* dependencies.
    *   **Private Gem Repository (High Security Environments):** In very high-security environments, consider using a private gem repository to *strictly* control the source of Puma and its dependencies, and to thoroughly vet any updates before they are made available.
    * **Vigilance and Rapid Response:** Monitor for announcements about compromises of the RubyGems infrastructure or Puma's repository. Be prepared to quickly isolate and investigate any suspicious behavior.
