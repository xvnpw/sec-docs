# Attack Surface Analysis for puma/puma

## Attack Surface: [Slowloris/Slow Request Attacks](./attack_surfaces/slowlorisslow_request_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers consume server resources by sending HTTP requests very slowly, keeping connections open for extended periods.
    *   **Puma's Contribution:** Puma's core function is to handle HTTP requests.  Its request handling logic and connection management are the direct targets.  Even with built-in mitigations, edge cases or misconfigurations can leave Puma vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a partial HTTP request, sending one byte every few seconds, never completing the request, but *just* avoiding Puma's default timeouts.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) â€“ the server becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if mitigations are not properly configured or if the application has long-running request handlers).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Puma Configuration:** *Crucially*, ensure `first_data_timeout` and `persistent_timeout` are set to reasonably low values (e.g., 10-30 seconds, or even lower if appropriate for your application).  These are Puma's *primary* defense.  Test these settings under load.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** While a reverse proxy is *strongly* recommended, this item focuses on Puma.  The reverse proxy's mitigations are *separate* from Puma's.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor connection counts, request durations, and resource usage (CPU, memory, threads) to detect slowloris attacks early. This is crucial for identifying if Puma's timeouts are being bypassed.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit discrepancies in how HTTP requests are parsed by different components (front-end proxy, Puma, back-end servers) to inject malicious requests.
    *   **Puma's Contribution:** Puma's HTTP parser is a critical component.  *If* a vulnerability exists in Puma's parser that allows for inconsistent interpretation compared to a front-end proxy, this attack becomes possible.  This is less about interaction and more about a potential *internal* flaw in Puma.
    *   **Example:**  A hypothetical zero-day vulnerability in Puma's handling of a rarely used, obscure HTTP header combination allows an attacker to craft a request that is interpreted differently by Puma and a front-end proxy.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass security controls, unauthorized access to data, potential for server-side request forgery (SSRF).  The impact is severe because it bypasses front-end protections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for bypassing security controls, even though the likelihood of a *new* Puma-specific smuggling vulnerability is lower than a misconfiguration issue).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Puma Updates:** *This is the primary mitigation*.  Keep Puma meticulously up-to-date.  Security patches often address subtle parsing issues.  This is the most direct way to mitigate a Puma-specific vulnerability.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** While a reverse proxy is essential for *general* protection against smuggling, this entry focuses on *Puma's* contribution. A reverse proxy mitigates *interaction* issues, not necessarily a zero-day in Puma itself.
        * **Fuzzing (for Puma developers):** Rigorous fuzz testing of Puma's HTTP parser is crucial for identifying potential smuggling vulnerabilities. This is a proactive measure for the Puma project itself.

## Attack Surface: [Websocket Hijacking (CSWSH) - *If Puma handles Origin validation directly*](./attack_surfaces/websocket_hijacking__cswsh__-_if_puma_handles_origin_validation_directly.md)

* **Description:** Attackers trick users into visiting malicious sites that establish WebSocket connections, bypassing origin checks.
    * **Puma's Contribution:** *If and only if* Puma itself is directly responsible for validating the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake (rather than delegating entirely to Action Cable or another framework), then a misconfiguration or bug in Puma's handling could lead to CSWSH.  This is a crucial distinction.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical scenario where Puma's configuration allows bypassing the `Origin` check, even if Action Cable is *intended* to handle it.  Or, a bug in Puma's WebSocket handshake logic.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data, potential for impersonation or data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if Puma's origin validation is flawed or bypassed).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Puma Configuration (if applicable):** If Puma *does* have direct settings for WebSocket origin validation, ensure they are correctly configured to enforce strict origin checks.
        * **Verify Action Cable Integration:** Ensure that Action Cable (or the chosen framework) is *correctly* integrated with Puma and that its origin validation is functioning as expected.  This is about ensuring the *intended* validation is happening.
        * **Puma Updates:** Keep Puma updated to address any potential bugs in its WebSocket handshake logic.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Endpoints - *If Puma exposes them directly*](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_endpoints_-_if_puma_exposes_them_directly.md)

* **Description:** Unintentional exposure of Puma's internal monitoring or control endpoints (e.g., `/puma/stats`) to the public internet.
    * **Puma's Contribution:** If Puma *directly* exposes these endpoints without requiring authentication or access control, it creates the vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker accesses `https://your-app.com/puma/stats` and obtains information about the server's internal state, *because Puma itself is serving this endpoint without restriction*.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for denial of service (if control endpoints are exposed and misused).
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if control endpoints are exposed and allow modification of Puma's state).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Puma Configuration:** *Crucially*, ensure that if Puma *does* expose these endpoints, they are bound *only* to trusted interfaces (e.g., `localhost` or a private network IP).  Use the `bind` option with extreme care.  Do *not* bind these endpoints to a publicly accessible address.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** While a reverse proxy is the *best practice*, this entry focuses on Puma.  The reverse proxy's role is to *prevent* access to what Puma might be exposing.
