# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for puma/puma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Puma Timeout Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/puma_timeout_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Puma Timeout Configuration

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Puma Configuration:** Access the Puma configuration file (usually `config/puma.rb` in a Rails application).
        2.  **Set `first_data_timeout`:** Add or modify the line: `first_data_timeout 30` (adjust the value, e.g., 5-10 seconds, based on your application's needs). This sets the maximum time Puma will wait for the *first byte* of the request body.
        3.  **Set `persistent_timeout`:** Add or modify: `persistent_timeout 10` (adjust as needed, typically 5-10 seconds). This sets the maximum time Puma will wait for subsequent data on a persistent (keep-alive) connection.
        4.  **Set `worker_timeout`:** Add or modify: `worker_timeout 60` (adjust based on expected request processing times, with a buffer). This sets the maximum time a worker is allowed to process a single request.
        5.  **Ensure `queue_requests` is Enabled:** Verify that `queue_requests` is not set to `false`.  It should be `true` by default.  If it's missing, add: `queue_requests true`. This enables Puma's internal request queue.
        6.  **Restart Puma:** After making changes, restart Puma for the new configuration to take effect.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Slowloris (Denial of Service):** (Severity: High) - Limits the time Puma spends waiting for slow clients, preventing resource exhaustion.
        *   **Slow Request Processing:** (Severity: Medium) - `worker_timeout` prevents a single slow request from blocking a worker indefinitely.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Slowloris:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (provides some protection, but a reverse proxy is still crucial).
        *   **Slow Request Processing:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `worker_timeout` is set, but `first_data_timeout` and `persistent_timeout` are not explicitly configured. `queue_requests` is likely at its default (true), but needs verification.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit configuration of `first_data_timeout` and `persistent_timeout` is missing.  Verification of `queue_requests` setting is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Worker and Thread Configuration (Puma-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/worker_and_thread_configuration__puma-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Worker and Thread Configuration (Puma-Specific Aspects)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Analyze Application Behavior:** Understand how your application uses CPU and I/O.  Is it primarily CPU-bound (e.g., heavy computations) or I/O-bound (e.g., frequent database queries)?
        2.  **Set `workers`:**  In `config/puma.rb`, use the `workers` setting to specify the number of worker processes.  A good starting point is often 2-4 workers per CPU core, but adjust based on your analysis.
        3.  **Set `threads`:** In `config/puma.rb`, use the `threads` setting to specify the minimum and maximum number of threads per worker.  Example: `threads 1, 5` (minimum 1, maximum 5).  Adjust the range based on your application's I/O-bound nature.  More I/O-bound applications may benefit from more threads.
        4.  **Configure `preload_app!`:** If your application supports it, use `preload_app!` in `config/puma.rb`. This loads your application code *before* forking worker processes, enabling phased restarts and reducing memory usage (through copy-on-write).
        5.  **Configure `on_worker_boot`:** Use `on_worker_boot` in `config/puma.rb` to define code that runs when a new worker process starts.  This is crucial for re-establishing database connections, initializing caches, and performing other setup tasks that need to happen in each worker.
        6. **Configure `before_fork`:** Use `before_fork` to define code that runs in the master process before forking.
        7.  **Restart Puma:** After making changes, restart Puma.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Worker Starvation):** (Severity: High) - Prevents Puma from being overwhelmed by requests or running out of resources (CPU, memory).
        *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Medium) - Optimizes resource utilization for better performance.
        *   **Downtime During Deployments:** (Severity: Medium) - `preload_app!` and phased restarts minimize downtime.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper configuration and monitoring).
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Downtime During Deployments:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  `workers` and `threads` are set, but the values may not be optimal.  `preload_app!` is used, but `on_worker_boot` is not fully utilized for all necessary initialization tasks.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Thorough analysis and optimization of worker/thread counts are needed.  Full utilization of `on_worker_boot` and `before_fork` for all worker initialization and pre-fork tasks is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Puma Configuration (Directives)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_puma_configuration__directives_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Puma Configuration (Directives)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Control Server Token:** If using the Puma control server (`--control-url` and `--control-token`), *immediately* change the default `--control-token` to a strong, randomly generated, and securely stored value.  *Never* use the default token.
        2.  **Binding Interface:** Use the `-b` or `--bind` option to bind Puma to a specific network interface.  For example: `puma -b tcp://127.0.0.1:3000` (binds to localhost only).  Avoid binding to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) unless absolutely necessary and you have a properly configured reverse proxy.
        3.  **Disable Control Server (If Possible):** If you do *not* need the control server's functionality in your production environment, *remove* the `--control-url` and `--control-token` options entirely from your Puma startup command. This reduces the attack surface.
        4. **Worker Shutdown Timeout:** Use `worker_shutdown_timeout` setting. This setting controls how long Puma waits for a worker to shut down gracefully before forcefully killing it.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Control Server Access:** (Severity: High) - A strong, non-default control token prevents attackers from controlling Puma via the control server.
        *   **Network Exposure:** (Severity: Medium) - Binding to a specific interface limits Puma's exposure to the network.
        *  **Uncontrolled Memory Growth:** (Severity: Medium) - `worker_shutdown_timeout` can help mitigate memory leaks by periodically restarting workers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Control Server Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with a strong token).
        *   **Network Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (by binding to a specific interface).
        *   **Uncontrolled Memory Growth:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Puma is bound to `127.0.0.1`. `worker_shutdown_timeout` is not set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** The control server is enabled, but the control token may be the default or a weak value.  A review of whether the control server is actually needed in production is required. Explicit configuration of `worker_shutdown_timeout` is missing.
