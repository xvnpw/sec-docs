## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE via Puma](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce_via_puma.md)

*   **Exploit Puma's Integration with Other Components (Vulnerable Rack App):**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a vulnerability within the application code (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Sinatra) running *on* Puma, rather than Puma itself. This is the most common path to RCE.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify a vulnerable Rack application.
        2.  Craft an exploit targeting the specific vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, file inclusion).
        3.  Send the exploit via an HTTP request to the Puma server.
        4.  If successful, the exploit executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Varies greatly (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly (from Script Kiddie to Expert)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies greatly

*   **Direct Exploit of Known Puma CVE:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in a specific version of Puma.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify the Puma version running on the target server.
        2.  Search for known CVEs affecting that version.
        3.  Find or create an exploit for the CVE.
        4.  Send the exploit via an HTTP request to the Puma server.
        5.  If successful, the exploit executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS against Application via Puma](./attack_tree_paths/dos_against_application_via_puma.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion (Slow Client Connections):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker opens many connections to the Puma server but sends data very slowly (or not at all), tying up server resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Use a tool like Slowloris or create a custom script.
        2.  Open numerous connections to the Puma server.
        3.  Send HTTP headers very slowly, keeping the connections open for an extended period.
        4.  Repeat this process until the server's resources are exhausted.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Puma](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_puma.md)

*   **Exploit Puma's Error Handling (Verbose Errors):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker triggers errors in the application or Puma itself, hoping that verbose error messages will be displayed, revealing sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Send malformed or unexpected requests to the Puma server.
        2.  Observe the responses for error messages.
        3.  Analyze the error messages for sensitive information (e.g., file paths, database queries, internal configuration details).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if verbose errors are enabled)
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if verbose errors are displayed)

    *   **Analyze Error Messages:**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If errors are triggered)
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
