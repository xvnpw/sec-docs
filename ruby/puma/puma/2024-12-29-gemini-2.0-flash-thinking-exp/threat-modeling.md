### High and Critical Puma Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Puma web server.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to Puma's configuration files (e.g., `puma.rb`) through misconfigured access controls, exposed version control systems, or other means. These files might contain sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of application secrets, unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration files, file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Puma configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
        *   Ensure configuration files are not inadvertently committed to public version control repositories.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Control/Status Server Configuration
    *   **Description:** If the Puma control/status server is enabled without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker could connect to it and execute administrative commands, such as restarting the server or retrieving application status.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (server restart), information disclosure (application status), potential for further exploitation if vulnerabilities exist in the control server implementation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Control/Status server module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the control/status server in production environments if not strictly necessary.
        *   If required, enable authentication on the control server using strong, unique credentials.
        *   Restrict access to the control server to specific IP addresses or networks.

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured SSL/TLS Leading to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
    *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured SSL/TLS settings in Puma, such as using outdated protocols or weak ciphers, can make the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication between the client and the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, manipulation of data in transit.
    *   **Affected Component:** SSL/TLS handling within Puma.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Puma to use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable support for weak or insecure ciphers.
        *   Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate management and validation.
        *   Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Thread/Worker Starvation)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a large number of concurrent requests to the Puma server, exceeding the configured number of threads or workers. This can lead to resource exhaustion, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:**  Application downtime, inability for legitimate users to access the service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Thread/Worker management, request handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly configure the number of Puma workers and threads based on the server's resources and expected traffic.
        *   Implement request timeouts to prevent long-running requests from tying up resources indefinitely.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy with rate limiting and connection limiting capabilities to mitigate this type of attack.

*   **Threat:** Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Issues in Cluster Mode
    *   **Description:** When using Puma in cluster mode, vulnerabilities in the inter-process communication mechanism between worker processes could allow an attacker who has compromised one worker process to potentially interfere with or gain access to data or resources of other worker processes.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, compromise of multiple application instances, potential for wider system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Inter-process communication mechanisms in cluster mode.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Puma updated to benefit from any security fixes related to IPC.
        *   Ensure the underlying operating system and libraries used for IPC are secure and up-to-date.
        *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data shared between worker processes if possible.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Puma's Codebase
    *   **Description:** Like any software, Puma's codebase might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the Puma codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Puma updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known Puma vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Improper Security Updates
    *   **Description:** Failure to promptly apply security updates to Puma leaves the application vulnerable to known exploits that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Impact:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Puma application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the unpatched vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish a process for regularly reviewing and applying security updates to Puma.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or notifications for Puma.
        *   Consider using automated tools for dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
