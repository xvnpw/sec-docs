## Deep Analysis of Slowloris Attack

### Introduction

The Slowloris attack is a classic denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the way web servers handle concurrent connections. By sending incomplete HTTP requests and keeping those connections alive for an extended period, an attacker can exhaust the server's resources, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application. This analysis focuses on how this attack specifically impacts a Puma web server.

### Attack Mechanism in the Context of Puma

Puma, by default, operates in a multi-process and/or multi-threaded environment. It utilizes a pool of worker processes (in clustered mode) or threads (in single mode) to handle incoming requests. The Slowloris attack leverages the following aspects of this architecture:

1. **Connection Establishment:** The attacker initiates multiple TCP connections to the Puma server.
2. **Partial Request Sending:** Instead of sending a complete HTTP request, the attacker sends only a partial request, such as a partial header or a few bytes of the request body.
3. **Keeping Connections Alive:** The attacker intentionally delays sending the remaining parts of the request, sending small amounts of data periodically to keep the connections from timing out.
4. **Resource Exhaustion:**  Puma's worker processes or threads are allocated to handle these incomplete requests. Since the requests are never completed, these workers remain occupied, waiting for more data.
5. **Denial of Service:** As the number of incomplete connections grows, all available worker processes/threads become tied up, and the server is unable to accept or process legitimate requests from other users.

**Specifically for Puma:**

* **Worker Starvation:**  Each worker process or thread in Puma has a limited capacity to handle concurrent connections. Slowloris effectively starves these workers by holding them hostage with incomplete requests.
* **HTTP Parser Bottleneck:** Puma's HTTP parser is designed to handle complete requests. While it has timeouts, the attacker manipulates the timing to stay just within those limits, preventing the parser from immediately discarding the connection.
* **Impact on Queues:** If Puma is configured with a backlog queue for incoming connections, this queue can also fill up with the attacker's incomplete requests, further hindering the processing of legitimate requests.

### Puma's Vulnerability to Slowloris

Puma's susceptibility to Slowloris stems from the fundamental way web servers handle concurrent connections and the inherent nature of the HTTP protocol. However, certain aspects of Puma's default configuration can exacerbate the issue:

* **Default Timeout Values:** If the default timeout values for incomplete requests are too long, it gives the attacker more time to keep connections open.
* **Limited Number of Workers/Threads:** While configurable, a fixed number of workers or threads means that the server has a finite capacity to handle concurrent connections. Slowloris directly targets this limitation.
* **Reliance on Operating System TCP Stack:** Puma relies on the underlying operating system's TCP stack for connection management. While the OS has its own timeouts, the attacker can often manipulate the timing to bypass these.

### Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies:

* **Configure short timeouts for incomplete requests (`tcp_control_requests`, `persistent_timeout`):**
    * **Effectiveness:** This is a crucial first line of defense. `tcp_control_requests` limits the time Puma waits for the initial request line, while `persistent_timeout` limits the time for subsequent requests on a keep-alive connection. Shortening these timeouts forces Puma to close connections that are not progressing, freeing up worker resources.
    * **Limitations:**  Setting timeouts too aggressively can lead to false positives, where legitimate users with slow connections might experience dropped connections. Careful tuning is required.

* **Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with request timeout and buffering capabilities:**
    * **Effectiveness:** This is a highly effective mitigation. Reverse proxies like Nginx or HAProxy act as intermediaries, accepting the initial connection from the client. They can be configured with their own, stricter timeouts for incomplete requests. Buffering allows the proxy to receive the entire request before forwarding it to the Puma server, effectively shielding Puma from the slow, partial requests.
    * **Limitations:**  Requires deploying and configuring an additional component in the infrastructure. The reverse proxy itself needs to be properly secured and configured to handle potential attacks.

* **Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with protection against slowloris attacks:**
    * **Effectiveness:** WAFs are specifically designed to inspect HTTP traffic and identify malicious patterns. They can detect Slowloris attacks by analyzing the rate of data transmission, the completeness of requests, and other characteristics. WAFs can block or challenge suspicious requests before they reach the Puma server.
    * **Limitations:**  Requires purchasing and configuring a WAF solution. The effectiveness depends on the WAF's signature database and its ability to accurately identify Slowloris attacks without generating false positives.

### Potential Gaps and Further Considerations

While the proposed mitigations are effective, there are some potential gaps and further considerations:

* **Application-Level Timeouts:**  Consider implementing application-level timeouts for specific actions or requests. This can provide an additional layer of protection if the Puma-level timeouts are not sufficient.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring to detect potential Slowloris attacks in progress. Metrics like the number of open connections, CPU usage, and request latency can indicate an ongoing attack. Alerting mechanisms can notify administrators to take action.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy or WAF level to restrict the number of connections or requests from a single IP address within a specific timeframe. This can help mitigate attacks originating from a single source.
* **Connection Limits:**  Configure limits on the maximum number of concurrent connections that Puma can accept. This can prevent the server from being completely overwhelmed by a large number of Slowloris connections.
* **Operating System Tuning:**  Adjusting operating system-level TCP settings, such as `tcp_syn_retries` and `tcp_keepalive_time`, can provide some additional defense, although this should be done cautiously.
* **Code Review:**  While the focus is on Puma, ensure that the application code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited in conjunction with a Slowloris attack.

### Recommendations for Enhanced Security

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to enhance the application's resilience against Slowloris attacks:

1. **Implement Short Timeouts:**  Aggressively configure `tcp_control_requests` and `persistent_timeout` in Puma. Monitor for false positives and adjust as needed.
2. **Deploy a Reverse Proxy/Load Balancer:**  Utilize a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy with request timeout and buffering capabilities. This is the most effective mitigation strategy.
3. **Consider a WAF:**  Evaluate the need for a Web Application Firewall, especially if the application is publicly accessible and faces a high risk of attack.
4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**  Set up monitoring for key metrics and configure alerts to detect potential attacks.
5. **Explore Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy or WAF level.
6. **Review Connection Limits:**  Consider setting appropriate connection limits for Puma.
7. **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

The Slowloris attack poses a significant threat to Puma-based applications by potentially causing denial of service. Understanding the attack mechanism and Puma's architecture is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies. While configuring short timeouts within Puma provides a basic level of protection, deploying a reverse proxy or load balancer with request timeout and buffering capabilities is the most robust defense. Combining these measures with a WAF, monitoring, and rate limiting creates a layered security approach that significantly reduces the risk of a successful Slowloris attack. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to evolving threats are essential for maintaining a secure application.
