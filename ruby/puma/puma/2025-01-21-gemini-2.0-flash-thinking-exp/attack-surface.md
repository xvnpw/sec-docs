# Attack Surface Analysis for puma/puma

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:**  Discrepancies in how Puma and upstream proxies interpret HTTP request boundaries (e.g., `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`) allow attackers to inject malicious requests.
*   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma's specific implementation of HTTP parsing might differ from proxies, creating opportunities for misinterpretation.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request with conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. A proxy might forward one part of the request to Puma, while Puma interprets the remaining part as a new request, potentially targeting a different user or resource.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on the backend application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure consistent HTTP parsing logic between Puma and all upstream proxies.
    *   Configure proxies to normalize requests before forwarding them to Puma.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application to handle unexpected request formats.
    *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block request smuggling attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Puma Control App without Authentication](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_puma_control_app_without_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** The Puma control app, which allows for managing the server (e.g., restarting workers), is exposed without proper authentication.
*   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma provides this control app functionality, and if not secured, it becomes a direct entry point for malicious actions.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the control app endpoint (e.g., `/`). If no authentication is configured, they can send commands to restart workers, shut down the server, or potentially execute arbitrary code if the control app has such vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure (server status), and potentially remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist within the control app itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly recommend disabling the control app in production environments if not strictly necessary.**
    *   If the control app is required, **enable authentication using a strong shared secret or TLS client certificates.**
    *   Restrict access to the control app endpoint to trusted IP addresses or networks using firewall rules.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Slowloris/Slow Post Attacks](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_slowlorisslow_post_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send partial HTTP requests slowly, keeping many connections open and exhausting server resources.
*   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma's handling of persistent connections can make it susceptible if not configured with appropriate timeouts and connection limits.
*   **Example:** An attacker opens numerous connections to the Puma server and sends only a small portion of the request headers at a time, never completing the request. This ties up worker threads, preventing legitimate requests from being processed.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure appropriate timeouts for client connections in Puma (`linger_timeout`, `persistent_timeout`).
    *   Implement connection limits to restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address.
    *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with connection rate limiting and timeout features to filter malicious traffic before it reaches Puma.
