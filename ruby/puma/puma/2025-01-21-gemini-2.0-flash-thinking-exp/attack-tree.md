## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Request Flooding**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of seemingly legitimate requests to the Puma server, overwhelming its capacity to handle them. This exhausts server resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, leading to legitimate users being unable to access the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to execute, but effective defenses exist).
    *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability).
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, connection limits, and consider using a reverse proxy with DoS protection. Configure appropriate `max_threads` and `workers` settings in Puma.

*   **Attack Vector: Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Slowloris/Slow Post Attacks**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends HTTP requests but intentionally sends them very slowly or incompletely. This forces Puma to keep worker threads occupied waiting for the full request, eventually exhausting the pool of available workers and preventing new connections.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires some understanding of HTTP, but tools are available).
    *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability).
    *   **Mitigation:** Configure appropriate timeouts for request headers and bodies (`linger`, `wait_for_less_busy_worker`). Consider using a reverse proxy with timeout enforcement.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Critical Node & Attack Vector: Exploit Default or Weak Control Server Credentials**
    *   **Description:** If the Puma control server is enabled and uses default or easily guessable credentials, an attacker can authenticate and gain administrative access to the Puma instance.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development or initial deployments).
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control over Puma instance, potential for code execution).
    *   **Mitigation:** Change the default control server credentials immediately to strong, unique passwords. Secure access to the control server network. Disable the control server if not needed.

*   **High-Risk Path & Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Bind Address of Control Server**
    *   **Description:** If the Puma control server is configured to listen on a publicly accessible IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0) instead of a specific internal IP or localhost, an attacker on the network can access it without needing to be on the local machine.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Configuration error, less common in production).
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control over Puma instance, potential for code execution).
    *   **Mitigation:** Bind the control server to a specific, internal IP address or localhost. Use firewall rules to restrict access to the control server port.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Control Server Functionality (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_control_server_functionality__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Critical Node & Attack Vector: Execute Arbitrary Code via Control Server**
    *   **Description:** If vulnerabilities exist in the Puma control server's API or implementation, an attacker with authenticated access (gained through exploiting configuration weaknesses or other means) can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Puma.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific vulnerabilities in the control server, less common if Puma is updated).
    *   **Impact:** Critical (Full control over the server).
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep Puma updated to patch any control server vulnerabilities. Secure access to the control server. Disable if not needed. Implement strong authentication and authorization for the control server.

*   **High-Risk Path & Attack Vector: Modify Application State via Control Server**
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the Puma control server can use its commands to perform actions that disrupt the application's normal operation. This could include restarting workers, changing configuration settings (if allowed by the configuration), or triggering other administrative functions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If control server access is gained through weak credentials or insecure binding).
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Disruption of service, potential data loss or corruption depending on the actions).
    *   **Mitigation:** Secure access to the control server. Implement auditing of control server actions. Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring control server permissions.
