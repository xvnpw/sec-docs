# Threat Model Analysis for puma/puma

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the Puma server and keeps them open, consuming available worker threads or processes. This prevents legitimate users from establishing new connections and accessing the application.

**Impact:** The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, leading to business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Worker processes/threads, Connection handling module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `max_threads` and `min_threads` appropriately for the server's capacity.
* Implement connection timeouts (`tcp_control_requests`, `persistent_timeout`).
* Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with connection limiting and rate limiting capabilities.
* Implement SYN cookies or other anti-DoS measures at the network level.

## Threat: [Slowloris Attack](./threats/slowloris_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the Puma server, slowly sending headers or body data. This keeps connections open for an extended period, tying up worker threads and preventing them from handling legitimate requests.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or very slow for legitimate users, leading to denial of service.

**Affected Component:** HTTP Parser, Worker processes/threads.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure short timeouts for incomplete requests (`tcp_control_requests`, `persistent_timeout`).
* Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with request timeout and buffering capabilities.
* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with protection against slowloris attacks.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling](./threats/request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by the Puma server and upstream proxies or other backend systems. This can allow the attacker to bypass security controls or inject requests into other users' sessions.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities in the application or backend systems.

**Affected Component:** HTTP Parser, Request routing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure consistent interpretation of HTTP requests between Puma and any upstream proxies.
* Use HTTP/2 where possible, as it is less susceptible to request smuggling.
* Carefully configure and monitor reverse proxies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Insecure Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_insecure_configuration.md)

**Description:** Puma's configuration files (e.g., `puma.rb`) might contain sensitive information like secret keys, database credentials, or API tokens. If these files are not properly protected, an attacker could gain access to them.

**Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, potential for further attacks on the application or related systems.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loader.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure secrets management systems instead of directly in configuration files.
* Restrict access to Puma configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
* Avoid committing sensitive information to version control systems.
