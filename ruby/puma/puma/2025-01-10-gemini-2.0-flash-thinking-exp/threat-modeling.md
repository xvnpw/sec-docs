# Threat Model Analysis for puma/puma

## Threat: [Malformed Request Denial of Service](./threats/malformed_request_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests with unexpected or invalid data (e.g., extremely long headers, invalid characters in URLs) directly to the Puma server. This exploits vulnerabilities within Puma's request parsing logic.
*   **Impact:** Puma worker processes or threads crash or become unresponsive, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users. The entire server might become overloaded, requiring a restart.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Slowloris Attack](./threats/slowloris_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker establishes multiple connections directly to the Puma server and sends incomplete HTTP requests slowly, keeping those connections open for an extended period. This ties up Puma's worker processes/threads, preventing them from handling legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Legitimate users are unable to connect to the application, resulting in denial of service. The server might become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__cpumemory_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of legitimate-looking requests directly to the Puma server, overwhelming its processing capacity. This can exhaust CPU resources and memory managed by Puma's worker processes.
*   **Impact:** The server becomes slow and unresponsive. Legitimate requests take a very long time to process or are dropped. In severe cases, the server might crash due to out-of-memory errors within Puma's processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Puma's TLS/SSL configuration is set up to use outdated or weak protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0) or weak cipher suites directly within Puma's settings. This makes the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted between the client and the server (e.g., login credentials, personal information) can be intercepted and decrypted by attackers due to weaknesses in Puma's TLS setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets, is stored directly within Puma's configuration files or environment variables that Puma directly accesses. If these files or the environment are compromised, this information is exposed due to Puma's direct access and usage.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive resources, compromise other systems, or perform unauthorized actions by exploiting the exposed credentials managed by Puma.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Information](./threats/logging_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:** Puma's logging functionality is configured to record sensitive information from requests or responses (e.g., user passwords, API keys, session tokens) directly into its log files. If these logs are not properly secured, this information is exposed due to Puma's logging practices.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data by accessing Puma's log files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (*While the risk is medium, the impact of exposing credentials can be critical, so careful consideration is needed.*)

## Threat: [Signal Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/signal_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within Puma's code in how it handles system signals (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGUSR1). An attacker might be able to send malicious signals directly to the Puma process to cause unexpected behavior or even gain control of the Puma process itself.
*   **Impact:** Potential for denial of service, unexpected server behavior, or in extreme cases, remote code execution if a severe vulnerability exists within Puma's signal handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (*The likelihood might be lower, but the potential impact of gaining control over the Puma process can be critical.*)
