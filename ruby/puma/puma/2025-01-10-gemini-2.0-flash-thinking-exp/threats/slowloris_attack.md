## Deep Analysis of Slowloris Attack on Puma

This document provides a deep analysis of the Slowloris attack targeting an application using the Puma web server. It elaborates on the threat, its impact on Puma, potential vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Mechanism in the Context of Puma:**

The Slowloris attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the way web servers handle concurrent connections. Specifically, it targets the server's ability to manage a limited number of worker processes or threads responsible for handling incoming requests.

Here's how it plays out against a Puma server:

1. **Connection Establishment:** The attacker initiates numerous TCP connections to the Puma server.
2. **Incomplete Request Initiation:**  For each connection, the attacker sends a partial HTTP request. This typically involves sending a valid HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) and a target resource, but deliberately omitting the final blank line that signals the end of the HTTP headers.
3. **Keeping Connections Alive:** The attacker periodically sends small amounts of data (e.g., a few bytes of a header value) to keep the connection alive and prevent the server from timing out the request.
4. **Resource Exhaustion:** Puma, expecting the complete request to arrive, keeps these connections open and assigns a worker process or thread to each. Because the requests are incomplete, the workers remain blocked, waiting for the rest of the data.
5. **Denial of Service:** As the attacker establishes more and more of these "slow" connections, all available Puma worker processes/threads become occupied. Consequently, the server is unable to accept and process legitimate requests from genuine users, leading to a denial of service.

**Puma-Specific Vulnerabilities and Considerations:**

While Slowloris is a general web server vulnerability, understanding Puma's architecture helps pinpoint its susceptibility:

* **Limited Worker Processes/Threads:** Puma operates with a finite number of worker processes (in clustered mode) or threads (in single-process mode). The `workers` and `threads` configuration options define these limits. Slowloris aims to saturate these resources.
* **Connection Queue:**  Puma has a connection queue to handle incoming connections before they are assigned to a worker. While this queue can buffer some requests, it has a limited capacity. A large influx of Slowloris connections can fill this queue, preventing even connection establishment for legitimate users.
* **Timeout Settings:** Puma has various timeout settings (e.g., `TCP_NODELAY`, `keepalive_timeout`). If these timeouts are too generous, it gives the attacker more time to hold connections open.
* **Resource Consumption per Connection:** Each open connection, even an incomplete one, consumes server resources like memory and file descriptors. A large number of Slowloris connections can lead to resource exhaustion beyond just the worker pool.
* **Operating System Limits:** The underlying operating system also has limits on the number of open file descriptors and network connections. A successful Slowloris attack can push these limits, impacting the entire system's stability.

**Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a successful Slowloris attack on a Puma-based application can be severe:

* **Complete Service Outage:** Legitimate users will be unable to access the application, resulting in a complete denial of service. This can lead to significant business disruption, loss of revenue, and damage to reputation.
* **Server Unresponsiveness:** The server might become completely unresponsive, requiring a manual restart to recover.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The attack can lead to high CPU usage, memory exhaustion, and depletion of file descriptors, potentially impacting other applications running on the same server.
* **Application Instability:** Even if the server doesn't completely crash, the prolonged resource pressure can lead to application instability and unpredictable behavior.
* **Difficulty in Diagnosis:**  Identifying a Slowloris attack can be challenging as the attack traffic might appear similar to legitimate slow connections.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To protect a Puma-based application from Slowloris attacks, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

**1. Network Level Defenses:**

* **Load Balancers and Reverse Proxies:**
    * **Connection Limits:** Configure load balancers or reverse proxies (like Nginx or HAProxy) to limit the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address. This can effectively throttle attackers.
    * **Request Timeouts:** Implement aggressive timeouts for incomplete or slow requests at the load balancer level.
    * **Request Buffering:** Configure the reverse proxy to buffer complete requests before passing them to Puma. This prevents Puma from being directly exposed to incomplete requests.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting based on IP address or other criteria to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a specific timeframe.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**
    * **Slowloris Attack Detection Rules:**  WAFs can be configured with rules to detect patterns indicative of Slowloris attacks, such as incomplete headers or slow data transmission.
    * **IP Blocking/Blacklisting:**  WAFs can automatically block or blacklist IP addresses identified as sources of malicious traffic.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    * **Signature-Based Detection:**  IDS/IPS can identify known Slowloris attack patterns.
    * **Anomaly-Based Detection:**  They can detect unusual network traffic behavior that might indicate an attack.

**2. Puma Configuration:**

* **Aggressive Timeouts:**
    * **`rack_timeout` gem:**  This gem can be used to enforce timeouts for request processing within the Rack application layer. Set reasonable timeouts to prevent requests from holding worker processes indefinitely.
    * **`tcp_syn_retries` (Operating System Level):** While not directly a Puma configuration, reducing the number of TCP SYN retries at the OS level can help in quickly rejecting malicious connection attempts.
* **Minimize `keepalive_timeout`:** While keep-alive connections can improve performance, a very long timeout can be exploited by Slowloris. Set a reasonable value.
* **Consider `backlog`:** The `backlog` setting in Puma controls the size of the connection queue. While increasing it might seem helpful, a very large backlog can mask the underlying issue and delay the detection of an attack. A moderate value is generally recommended.
* **Operating System Tuning:**
    * **Increase `somaxconn`:** This operating system setting controls the maximum size of the listen queue for incoming TCP connections. Increasing it can help handle a burst of connection attempts.
    * **Tune TCP parameters:**  Adjusting TCP parameters like `tcp_synack_retries` and `tcp_fin_timeout` can improve resilience against connection-based attacks.

**3. Application Level Defenses:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly preventing Slowloris, robust input validation can mitigate other vulnerabilities that attackers might try to exploit alongside a DoS attack.
* **Connection Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust logging to track connection attempts, request processing times, and error rates. This can help in identifying and diagnosing attacks.

**4. Infrastructure Considerations:**

* **Scaling:**  Having sufficient server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) can help absorb some of the impact of a Slowloris attack. Horizontal scaling (adding more servers) can distribute the load.
* **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** CDNs can help absorb some of the initial connection attempts and reduce the load on the origin server.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Monitoring Connection Counts:** Track the number of active connections to the Puma server. A sudden and sustained increase in connections from a single or multiple sources could indicate an attack.
* **Analyzing Request Logs:** Look for patterns of incomplete requests or requests with unusually long processing times.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic. High resource utilization without corresponding legitimate traffic can be a sign of an attack.
* **Using Network Monitoring Tools:** Tools like `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, or `iftop` can be used to analyze network traffic and identify suspicious patterns.
* **Alerting Systems:** Configure alerts based on the monitored metrics to notify administrators of potential attacks.

**Development Team Considerations:**

* **Security Awareness:** Ensure the development team understands the risks associated with Slowloris attacks and other DoS vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Configuration Practices:**  Follow secure configuration guidelines for Puma and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a well-defined incident response plan to handle security incidents, including DoS attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The Slowloris attack poses a significant threat to Puma-based applications due to its ability to exhaust server resources by holding open numerous incomplete connections. A comprehensive defense strategy involving network-level mitigations, careful Puma configuration, application-level security measures, and robust monitoring is crucial. The development team plays a vital role in implementing and maintaining these defenses to ensure the availability and resilience of the application. By understanding the mechanics of the attack and its impact on Puma, developers can proactively implement the necessary safeguards to protect against this common and effective DoS technique.
