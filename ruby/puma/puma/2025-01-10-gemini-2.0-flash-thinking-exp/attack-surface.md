# Attack Surface Analysis for puma/puma

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:**  Puma offers numerous configuration settings. Using insecure defaults or misconfiguring these options can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma's flexibility in configuration allows for settings that compromise security if not properly understood and applied.
    *   **Example:** Binding Puma to `0.0.0.0` on a public-facing server without a firewall allows anyone on the internet to access the application directly, bypassing intended network restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific misconfiguration and data sensitivity).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review all Puma configuration options and understand their security implications.
        *   Bind Puma to specific internal IP addresses or use a reverse proxy for public access.
        *   Avoid using default secrets or tokens for features like the control server.
        *   Enable and properly configure TLS/SSL.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Control Server](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_control_server.md)

*   **Description:** Puma's control server provides an interface to manage the Puma process. If not properly secured, it can be abused.
    *   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma offers this control server feature, and its security is dependent on the configuration.
    *   **Example:**  Enabling the control server without any authentication allows anyone who can reach the control port to execute commands like `restart`, `halt`. Using HTTP instead of HTTPS exposes control commands in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution (if vulnerabilities exist in control server command handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication for the control server (using a secure token).
        *   Use HTTPS for the control server to encrypt communication.
        *   Restrict access to the control server port to authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Carefully consider if the control server is necessary in production environments and disable it if not.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configuring TLS/SSL for HTTPS can leave the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches.
    *   **How Puma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Puma is responsible for configuring and utilizing the TLS/SSL certificates and protocols.
    *   **Example:** Using outdated TLS versions (like TLS 1.0 or 1.1) or weak cipher suites makes the connection susceptible to known vulnerabilities. Not enforcing HTTPS and allowing HTTP connections exposes data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and up-to-date TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Configure secure cipher suites and disable weak ones.
        *   Enforce HTTPS and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
        *   Regularly update TLS/SSL libraries.
