### High and Critical Tmuxinator Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving Tmuxinator.

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted YAML Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker could edit an existing Tmuxinator YAML configuration file or replace it with a malicious one. This file would contain embedded commands designed to harm the system when the project is started using `tmuxinator start`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the server where the application is being developed or deployed. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   YAML parsing logic within Tmuxinator that interprets the configuration file.
        *   Command execution functionality that executes the defined commands in `pre`, `windows`, and `panes` sections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on Tmuxinator configuration files, ensuring only trusted users can modify them.
        *   Regularly review configuration files for any unexpected or suspicious commands.
        *   Use a "dotfiles" manager or similar tool to track changes to configuration files and easily revert to known good states.
        *   Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding sensitive information directly in the configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, internal URLs, or other secrets directly within the Tmuxinator YAML configuration files. If these files are not properly secured, an attacker could gain access to this information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches, and compromise of connected systems or services.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The YAML configuration files themselves.
        *   Potentially the environment variable loading mechanism if secrets are intended to be loaded this way but are also present in the file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management tools (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to manage sensitive information.
        *   Ensure configuration files are not committed to public repositories.
        *   Implement proper access controls on the directories containing Tmuxinator configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Injection
    *   **Description:** If the application dynamically generates or modifies Tmuxinator configuration files based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands or configurations into the YAML file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution when the project is started, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The application code responsible for generating or modifying Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   The YAML parsing logic within Tmuxinator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly incorporate unsanitized user input or external data into Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   If dynamic generation is necessary, use a secure templating engine or a library specifically designed for generating YAML to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any data used to generate configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Command Execution
    *   **Description:** If Tmuxinator is run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root or via `sudo`), the commands defined in the configuration files will also be executed with those privileges. An attacker who can modify the configuration file could leverage this to execute commands with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, as the attacker can execute commands with root or administrator privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Command execution functionality within Tmuxinator.
        *   The system's privilege management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run Tmuxinator with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root or with `sudo` unless absolutely required.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the configuration files to prevent unauthorized modification.
