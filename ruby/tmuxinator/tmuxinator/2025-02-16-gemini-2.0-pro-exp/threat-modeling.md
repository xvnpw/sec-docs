# Threat Model Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Threat: [Arbitrary Command Injection via YAML Configuration](./threats/arbitrary_command_injection_via_yaml_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is used to generate or modify a `tmuxinator` YAML configuration file. This input includes shell commands that are executed when the `tmuxinator` session starts or reloads. The attacker might achieve this through a vulnerability in the application that allows them to influence the configuration file content, even indirectly. This is a *direct* threat because it exploits `tmuxinator`'s core functionality of parsing and executing YAML.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains shell access with the privileges of the user running `tmuxinator`, potentially leading to data theft, system modification, or further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `tmuxinator` core functionality: specifically, the parsing and execution of YAML configuration files (`start` command, and any functionality that reloads configurations). The `project.yml` file (or whatever the configuration file is named) is the direct target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**  *Never* allow direct user input to populate the YAML file. If user input *must* influence the configuration, use a strict whitelist of allowed commands, arguments, and options.  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.  Prefer parameterized commands (e.g., using a templating engine that escapes shell metacharacters) over string concatenation.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration Generation:** If possible, use pre-defined, static `tmuxinator` configurations.  If dynamic generation is unavoidable, use a highly constrained templating system that prevents arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application (and thus `tmuxinator`) under a dedicated, unprivileged user account.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even with command execution.
        *   **File System Permissions:**  Store configuration files in a directory with restricted read/write access, accessible only to the application user and authorized administrators.
        *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:** Use tools like AIDE or Tripwire to detect unauthorized modifications to configuration files.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review any code that interacts with or generates `tmuxinator` configurations.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to an existing `tmuxinator`-managed tmux session. This could be achieved by guessing or discovering the session name (if predictable), or by exploiting a vulnerability in the application that exposes session names or allows direct interaction with the tmux server *through tmuxinator's commands*. The attacker could then observe the session's contents, inject commands, or potentially use the session as a stepping stone for further attacks. This is considered *direct* if the application uses `tmuxinator` commands (like `attach`) in a way that's vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data within the session), command injection (potentially leading to privilege escalation), and disruption of legitimate user activity.
    *   **Affected Component:** `tmuxinator`'s session management. Specifically, how the application uses commands like `attach` (or equivalent functionality to connect to existing sessions) is the key area. If the application exposes session names or allows uncontrolled attachment, it's a direct vulnerability related to `tmuxinator` usage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Session Naming:** Use strong, randomly generated session names. Avoid predictable patterns or user-supplied names.  Do *not* expose session names to users unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Session Isolation:** Ensure proper user separation on the server.  Each user should have their own tmux server instance, if possible, to prevent cross-user session access.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control within the application to ensure that users can only interact with their own sessions *through the intended `tmuxinator` commands*.
        *   **Limit Session Lifetime:** Automatically terminate inactive sessions after a defined timeout period.
        *   **Tmux Socket Permissions:** Ensure the tmux socket file (usually in `/tmp`) has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
