## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit YAML Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_yaml_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit how tmuxinator parses YAML configuration files. If unsafe YAML loading is used, specifically `YAML.load` in Ruby without proper precautions, attackers can inject malicious YAML code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 YAML Injection in Project Config File:**
        *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious YAML with `!ruby/object`:**
            *   **1.1.1.1 Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker crafts a YAML file containing special Ruby object tags (e.g., `!ruby/object`) that, when deserialized by an unsafe YAML parser, instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects and execute code.
            *   **1.1.1.2 Read Arbitrary Files via Deserialization [CRITICAL]:** Similar to RCE, but the injected YAML triggers file read operations instead of full code execution.
        *   **1.1.3 Manipulate YAML to Include Unexpected Commands:**
            *   **1.1.3.1 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands via `pre`, `pre_window` [CRITICAL]:** The attacker modifies the YAML configuration to include malicious shell commands within the `pre` or `pre_window` directives. These commands are executed before a window is created.
            *   **1.1.3.2 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands via `on_project_start/exit` [CRITICAL]:** Similar to 1.1.3.1, but the commands are executed when the tmuxinator project starts or exits.
    *   **1.2 YAML Injection via Environment Variables:**
        *   **1.2.1.1 Trigger Code Execution or File Read via YAML Parsing [CRITICAL]:** If tmuxinator uses environment variables unsafely within the YAML configuration (e.g., embedding them directly without sanitization), and unsafe YAML loading is used, an attacker can set a malicious environment variable to inject code or trigger file reads.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Command Injection in Shell Commands [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_command_injection_in_shell_commands__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious shell commands into the commands executed by tmuxinator. This typically occurs when user-supplied input is directly embedded into shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1 Inject Commands into `pre`, `pre_window`, `on_project_start/exit`:**
        *   **2.1.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]:** If user input is used to construct the commands in `pre`, `pre_window`, `on_project_start`, or `on_project_exit` without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `` ` ``) to execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **2.1.2.1 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [CRITICAL]:**  This represents a scenario where the application *attempts* to sanitize input, but the attacker finds a way to bypass the sanitization mechanism.
    *   **2.2 Inject Commands into `tmux` Commands:**
        *   **2.2.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands within a tmux Session [CRITICAL]:** Similar to 2.1, but the injection occurs within `tmux` commands defined in the configuration. This allows the attacker to execute commands within the context of a tmux session.
        *   **2.2.2.1 Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands within a tmux Session [CRITICAL]:**  Bypass of attempted sanitization, similar to 2.1.2.1, but within the tmux context.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit tmuxinator's Interaction with tmux](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_tmuxinator's_interaction_with_tmux.md)

* **Description:** These are less likely but very high-impact vulnerabilities that involve exploiting bugs *within tmux itself*.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **3.1.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Code on the Host [CRITICAL]:** This requires a vulnerability in tmux that allows escaping the tmux session and gaining control of the host operating system.
    * **3.1.2.1 Achieve Code Execution or Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL]:** This covers other potential tmux vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, that could lead to code execution or data exfiltration.
    * **3.2.2.1 Potentially Achieve Code Execution [CRITICAL]:** This is a very unlikely scenario where manipulating tmux session or window names could trigger a buffer overflow in tmux or a related component.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Exfiltration via tmux Sessions [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_exfiltration_via_tmux_sessions__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to sensitive data within tmux sessions managed by tmuxinator. This can happen through unauthorized access to running sessions or by retrieving session history.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **4.1.1.1 Read Sensitive Data Displayed in the Session [CRITICAL]:** If an attacker can attach to a running tmux session as another user (due to misconfigured permissions), they can view any data displayed within that session.
    *   **4.1.2.1 Retrieve Past Commands and Output [CRITICAL]:** If tmux session history is enabled and the attacker can access the history files, they can retrieve past commands and their output, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    *   **4.2.1.1 Exfiltrate Captured Data [CRITICAL]:** If the attacker has already achieved command execution (through other vulnerabilities), they can use tmux commands like `capture-pane` to capture the contents of a session and then exfiltrate that data.
