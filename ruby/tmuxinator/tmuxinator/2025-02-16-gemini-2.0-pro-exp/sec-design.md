# Project Design Document: Tmuxinator

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Tmuxinator is a tool that allows users to easily manage complex tmux sessions using simple configuration files. It's targeted at developers and system administrators who frequently work with multiple terminal sessions.

Priorities:

-   Ease of use: Simplify the creation and management of tmux sessions.
-   Maintainability: Ensure the project is easy to maintain and extend.
-   Reliability: Provide a stable and predictable user experience.
-   Community: Foster a community around the project for contributions and support.

Goals:

-   Reduce the time spent setting up and managing tmux sessions.
-   Provide a consistent and reproducible way to define tmux configurations.
-   Increase productivity for users who rely on tmux.

Business Risks:

-   Low adoption rate: If users don't find the tool useful or easy to use, it won't be widely adopted.
-   Maintenance burden: If the project is not well-maintained, it may become difficult to fix bugs and add new features.
-   Security vulnerabilities: Although primarily a client-side tool, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited if user-provided configurations are not handled safely.
-   Compatibility issues: Changes in tmux or underlying operating systems could break compatibility, leading to user frustration.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

-   security control: Code linting: The project uses RuboCop for code style and linting (implied by the presence of `.rubocop.yml`).
-   security control: Test coverage: The project includes a test suite (implied by the presence of a `spec` directory).
-   security control: Dependency management: The project uses Bundler for dependency management (implied by the presence of `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`).

Accepted Risks:

-   accepted risk: Limited input sanitization: Tmuxinator primarily deals with configuration files, but user-provided input (e.g., project names, window names) might not be fully sanitized.
-   accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies: The project depends on external gems, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
-   accepted risk: No formal security audits: The project does not appear to have undergone formal security audits.

Recommended Security Controls:

-   security control: Input validation: Implement robust input validation to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities.
-   security control: Regular dependency updates: Keep dependencies up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
-   security control: Security-focused code review: Emphasize security during code reviews.
-   security control: Consider using a static analysis security tool (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

-   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as Tmuxinator is a client-side tool that leverages the user's existing system authentication.
-   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as Tmuxinator operates within the user's existing permissions.
-   Input Validation:
    -   Validate all user-provided input, including project names, window names, commands, and paths.
    -   Sanitize input to prevent potential injection attacks (e.g., shell command injection).
    -   Enforce length limits on input fields where appropriate.
-   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as Tmuxinator does not handle sensitive data requiring encryption. However, if secrets are ever stored (which should be avoided), they should be encrypted.
-   Configuration files:
    -   Warn users about the potential risks of executing arbitrary commands from configuration files.
    -   Consider providing a "safe mode" that disables potentially dangerous features.

    Developer["Developer"]
    GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    LocalBuild["Local Build Environment"]
    Tests["Tests"]
    GemFile["Gem File"]
    RubyGems["RubyGems.org"]

    Developer -- "Commits Code" --> GitHub

    LocalBuild -- "Runs" --> Tests
    LocalBuild -- "Uses" --> GemFile
    LocalBuild -- "Builds Gem" --> GemFile
    Developer -- "Pushes Gem" --> RubyGems
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and commit it to the GitHub repository.
2.  Developers can build and test the gem locally using Bundler and RSpec.
3.  The `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` define the project's dependencies.
4.  The `rake build` command (implied) is used to build the gem.
5.  The `rake release` command (implied) is used to publish the gem to RubyGems.org.

Security Controls:

-   security control: Dependency management with Bundler: Ensures consistent and controlled dependencies.
-   security control: Test suite: Helps to identify bugs and regressions.
-   security control: Code linting with RuboCop: Enforces code style and helps to prevent some types of errors.
-   security control: Manual gem publishing: Requires developer credentials to publish to RubyGems.org.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

-   Managing tmux sessions efficiently.
-   Reproducing development environments consistently.

Data Protection:

-   Data Sensitivity: Low. Tmuxinator primarily handles configuration data, not sensitive personal or business data. However, configuration files *could* contain sensitive information if users embed secrets directly (which is strongly discouraged).
-   Data to Protect: Tmuxinator configuration files. While not inherently sensitive, they define the user's development environment and should be protected from unauthorized modification.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

-   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements beyond general best practices.)
-   Are there any plans to integrate Tmuxinator with other tools or services? (Assumption: No immediate plans for integration.)
-   What is the expected user base and usage patterns? (Assumption: Primarily developers and system administrators using it for personal or small-team projects.)
-   Is there a mechanism for users to report security vulnerabilities? (Assumption: Users can report issues via GitHub.)

Assumptions:

-   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a convenient and reliable tool for managing tmux sessions.
-   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows basic security best practices, but there is room for improvement.
-   DESIGN: The design is relatively simple and straightforward, with a focus on ease of use and maintainability. The provided C4 diagrams are accurate representations of the system. The deployment process relies on RubyGems. The build process is standard for a Ruby gem.
