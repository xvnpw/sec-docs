# Attack Surface Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Attack Surface: [YAML Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/yaml_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in the YAML parsing library used by Tmuxinator that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious YAML configuration files.
*   **Tmuxinator Contribution:** Tmuxinator relies on YAML parsing to load project configurations from `.tmuxinator.yml` files. This direct dependency on YAML parsing makes it vulnerable if the parser has deserialization flaws.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a `.tmuxinator.yml` file containing YAML directives that exploit a known deserialization vulnerability in the Ruby YAML library. When a user runs `tmuxinator start malicious_project`, Tmuxinator parses this file, triggering the vulnerability and executing arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Full control of the system.
    *   Data Breach - Access to sensitive data on the system.
    *   System Compromise - Installation of malware, backdoors, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Tmuxinator and Ruby Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Tmuxinator and its Ruby gem dependencies, especially the YAML parsing library (e.g., `psych`), to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement dependency scanning tools to automatically detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in Tmuxinator's dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the command definitions within Tmuxinator configuration files (`.tmuxinator.yml`).
*   **Tmuxinator Contribution:** Tmuxinator directly executes commands specified in the `pre_window`, `panes`, and `post` sections of the YAML configuration files using shell execution. This core functionality of executing user-defined commands directly creates the command injection attack surface.
*   **Example:** A user creates or uses a `.tmuxinator.yml` file where a pane command is defined as `pane: "echo 'Vulnerable' && malicious_command"`. When Tmuxinator starts this project, it executes both `echo 'Vulnerable'` and `malicious_command` in the pane, potentially compromising the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution - Full control within the tmux session and potentially the user's context.
    *   Data Exfiltration - Stealing sensitive data accessible in the tmux session.
    *   System Modification - Changing system settings or files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration File Creation:**  Carefully construct configuration files and avoid using user-provided input directly in command definitions without robust sanitization (which is complex and generally not recommended for shell commands in YAML).
    *   **Code Review Configuration Files:** Review `.tmuxinator.yml` files, especially those from untrusted sources, for any suspicious or unexpected commands before using them.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Tmuxinator under user accounts with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Generation:** Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically generate commands within configuration files based on external input.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal/Malicious Configuration Loading](./attack_surfaces/path_traversalmalicious_configuration_loading.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate file paths used by Tmuxinator to load configuration files, potentially leading to loading malicious configurations from attacker-controlled locations and executing commands within them.
*   **Tmuxinator Contribution:** Tmuxinator's mechanism for locating and loading `.tmuxinator.yml` files, if not properly secured, can be abused to load configurations from unintended or malicious sources. This direct file loading functionality is the contributing factor.
*   **Example:** An attacker hosts a malicious `.tmuxinator.yml` file on a network share or tricks a user into placing it in a location where Tmuxinator might search. If Tmuxinator can be coerced into loading this malicious file (e.g., through path traversal or by manipulating search paths), the attacker can control the commands executed when the user attempts to start a project.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Configuration Override - Loading malicious configurations instead of intended ones.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution - Execution of attacker-controlled commands defined in the malicious configuration file.
    *   System Compromise - Potential for full system compromise depending on the commands in the malicious configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Configuration File Locations:**  Limit the locations where Tmuxinator searches for configuration files to well-defined and secure directories under user control.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization of File Paths:** If Tmuxinator allows user-provided file paths for project loading, rigorously validate and sanitize these paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
    *   **Secure Configuration File Sources:** Only use `.tmuxinator.yml` files from trusted sources and repositories. Avoid using configurations from unknown or untrusted origins.
