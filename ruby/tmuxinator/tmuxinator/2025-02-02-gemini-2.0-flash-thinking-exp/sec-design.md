# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, tmuxinator, is an open-source tool designed to enhance developer productivity by simplifying the management of tmux sessions. It allows users to define and manage complex tmux layouts and configurations through simple YAML files.

* Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Primary goal: Increase developer productivity by streamlining tmux session management.
  - Secondary goal: Provide a user-friendly and configurable tool for tmux users.
  - Tertiary goal: Foster an open-source community around tmux session management.

* Business Risks:
  - Risk 1: Loss of developer productivity due to tool malfunction or unexpected behavior. This is a low impact risk as tmuxinator is a productivity enhancement tool, not a critical system dependency.
  - Risk 2: Security vulnerabilities in tmuxinator could potentially compromise developer workstations if exploited. This risk is moderate, as tmuxinator operates locally but handles configuration files that could be manipulated.
  - Risk 3: Lack of adoption or community support could lead to project stagnation and reduced value over time. This is a low impact risk as the project is already established and has a user base.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. Implemented by: GitHub.
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and contributions. Implemented by: Open-source nature of the project.
  - security control: RubyGems package distribution. Implemented by: RubyGems infrastructure.

* Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on RubyGems infrastructure for package integrity and availability.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies (Ruby gems).
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or audits.

* Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerable Ruby gems.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide clear security guidelines for users regarding configuration file security.

* Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. Tmuxinator is a local command-line tool and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. Tmuxinator operates within the user's local environment and relies on the operating system's user permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate user-provided YAML configuration files to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs in command-line arguments to prevent command injection.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. Tmuxinator does not handle sensitive data that requires encryption. However, consider potential future features that might require secure storage of credentials or sensitive information.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
  - Protecting developer productivity and efficiency. Any disruption to the tool's functionality could slightly impact developer workflows.

* Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Configuration Files (YAML): These files define developer's tmux session setups and might contain project names, directory structures, and commands. Sensitivity is low to medium. Exposure might reveal project details or workflow preferences, but no highly sensitive data is typically stored.
  - Source Code: The source code of tmuxinator itself. Sensitivity is low as it is open source. Integrity and availability are important for the project's continued development and distribution.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to enhance developer productivity within organizations or for individual developers.
  - Question: Are there specific target user segments (e.g., specific industries, company sizes) for tmuxinator?

* SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Current security posture relies on community contributions and standard open-source development practices.
  - Question: Are there any formal security audits or penetration testing planned or conducted for tmuxinator?
  - Question: Are there specific security guidelines for contributors or users beyond general best practices?

* DESIGN:
  - Assumption: The design is intentionally simple and focused on local execution without network dependencies.
  - Question: Are there any plans to introduce features that might require network communication or handling of more sensitive data in the future?
  - Assumption: Deployment is primarily local installation via RubyGems.
  - Question: Are there alternative deployment methods or considerations for different operating systems or environments?

These questions and assumptions can be further clarified with the project maintainers and community to refine the design document and threat model.
