## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Malicious Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_malicious_configuration_files__critical_node_-_attack_vector_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the reliance of tmuxinator on YAML configuration files to introduce malicious content.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers aim to inject or replace legitimate tmuxinator configuration files with malicious ones.
    *   Successful injection allows attackers to control tmux sessions and potentially execute arbitrary commands within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious Configuration File [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious_configuration_file__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** This path represents the initial step of injecting malicious configurations, leading to potential compromise.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers focus on methods to place malicious configuration files within the user's `.tmuxinator` directory or locations where tmuxinator reads configurations.
    *   This path branches into different entry points to achieve configuration injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Local File System Access [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_local_file_system_access__critical_node_-_entry_point_.md)

*   **Critical Entry Point:** Gaining access to the local file system is a crucial step for directly manipulating configuration files.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers target gaining access to the user's operating system account or the server's file system where tmuxinator configurations are stored.
    *   This access enables direct modification or replacement of configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Compromise User Account [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point, High Likelihood/Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_compromise_user_account__critical_node_-_entry_point__high_likelihoodimpact_.md)

*   **Critical Entry Point:** Compromising user accounts is a common and effective method to gain local file system access.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers employ techniques like phishing, password cracking, or credential stuffing to gain access to user accounts.
    *   Compromised accounts provide the necessary privileges to modify files within the user's home directory, including `.tmuxinator` configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Social Engineering (Trick user into placing malicious file) [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point, Medium Likelihood/High Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_social_engineering__trick_user_into_placing_malicious_file___critical_node_-_entry_point__me_fc378911.md)

*   **Critical Entry Point:** Social engineering can bypass technical security measures by manipulating users into performing actions that compromise security.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers use social engineering tactics to trick users into downloading and placing malicious tmuxinator configuration files into their `.tmuxinator` directory.
    *   This can be achieved through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other forms of deception.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit Command Execution Features [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_command_execution_features__critical_node_-_attack_vector___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting tmuxinator's core functionality of executing commands within tmux sessions to run malicious commands.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers target the command execution features of tmuxinator, specifically the `pre`, `post`, `panes`, and `windows` directives in configuration files.
    *   Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the user running tmuxinator.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Inject Malicious Commands via Configuration [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point, High Likelihood/Impact] [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_inject_malicious_commands_via_configuration__critical_node_-_entry_point__high_likelihoodimpact__1044f8ab.md)

*   **Critical Entry Point:** Injecting malicious commands into tmuxinator configurations is the primary method to exploit command execution features.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers focus on inserting malicious commands into the configuration file directives that control command execution.
    *   This can be achieved through direct configuration file manipulation (as in path 1.0) or by exploiting vulnerabilities in configuration processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Abuse of `pre`, `post`, `panes`, `windows` commands [CRITICAL NODE - High Likelihood/Impact, Direct Abuse of Feature] [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_abuse_of__pre____post____panes____windows__commands__critical_node_-_high_likelihoodimpact__di_bdba262d.md)

*   **Critical Node - Direct Abuse:** This node highlights the direct abuse of intended tmuxinator features for malicious purposes.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers directly utilize the `pre`, `post`, `panes`, and `windows` configuration directives to specify and execute malicious commands.
    *   These directives are designed for command execution, making them a prime target for abuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1 Execute arbitrary system commands [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact] [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1_execute_arbitrary_system_commands__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_continues_.md)

*   **Critical Node - High Impact:**  Successful execution of arbitrary system commands represents a severe security breach.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers aim to use tmuxinator to execute any command they choose on the system.
    *   This grants them full control over the system with the privileges of the user running tmuxinator.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.2 Modify application files/data [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact] [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_2_modify_application_filesdata__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_continues_.md)

*   **Critical Node - High Impact:** Modifying application files or data can lead to application malfunction, data corruption, or further compromise.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers use command execution to alter application code, configuration files, or sensitive data.
    *   This can disrupt application functionality or create backdoors for persistent access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.3 Establish reverse shell [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact] [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_3_establish_reverse_shell__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_end_.md)

*   **Critical Node - High Impact, Path End:** Establishing a reverse shell is a common and highly damaging outcome of successful command injection.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers use command execution to initiate a reverse shell connection back to their controlled server.
    *   This provides persistent remote access to the compromised system, allowing for ongoing malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.0 Social Engineering related to Tmuxinator Usage](./attack_tree_paths/4_0_social_engineering_related_to_tmuxinator_usage.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting user behavior and trust through social engineering to compromise security related to tmuxinator.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers focus on manipulating users into actions that lead to the use of malicious tmuxinator configurations.
    *   This vector relies on human error and trust rather than technical vulnerabilities in tmuxinator itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Trick user into using malicious configuration [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point, Medium Likelihood/High Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_trick_user_into_using_malicious_configuration__critical_node_-_entry_point__medium_likelihoodhig_b3f69b08.md)

*   **Critical Entry Point:** Tricking users is a direct and often effective way to introduce malicious configurations.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers employ social engineering tactics to convince users to use malicious tmuxinator configuration files.
    *   This can be achieved through various methods like phishing, impersonation, or creating a sense of urgency or authority.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1 Phishing with malicious tmuxinator configuration files [CRITICAL NODE - Medium Likelihood/High Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_phishing_with_malicious_tmuxinator_configuration_files__critical_node_-_medium_likelihoodhigh__1f5b769d.md)

*   **Critical Node - Medium Likelihood/High Impact:** Phishing is a common and relatively successful social engineering technique.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers use phishing emails or messages to distribute malicious tmuxinator configuration files disguised as legitimate or helpful configurations.
    *   Users who fall for the phishing attempt may unknowingly download and use the malicious configuration, leading to compromise.
