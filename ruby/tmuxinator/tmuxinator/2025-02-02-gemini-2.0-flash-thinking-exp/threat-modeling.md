# Threat Model Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration File Injection/Substitution](./threats/malicious_configuration_file_injectionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects or replaces a legitimate tmuxinator configuration file in `~/.tmuxinator/` with a malicious one. Upon session start, tmuxinator executes commands from this malicious file.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution leading to full system compromise, including data exfiltration, backdoor installation, and privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration File Loading (tmuxinator core functionality)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly limit write access to `~/.tmuxinator/` to the user only using file system permissions.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
    *   Regularly audit configuration files for any unexpected or suspicious commands.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Dynamic Configuration Generation](./threats/command_injection_through_dynamic_configuration_generation.md)

*   **Description:** If tmuxinator configurations are dynamically generated based on external, untrusted input, an attacker can manipulate this input to inject arbitrary commands into the generated configuration. When tmuxinator loads this configuration, the injected commands are executed.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to complete system takeover, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Dynamic Configuration Generation (external scripts/APIs interacting with tmuxinator), Command Parsing and Execution (tmuxinator core functionality)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamic configuration generation from untrusted external input if at all possible.
    *   If dynamic generation is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all external input before incorporating it into tmuxinator commands.
    *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell command execution when generating configurations dynamically to prevent injection.
