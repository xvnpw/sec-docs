## Attack Tree Path: [**1. [CRITICAL] Exploit Configuration File Vulnerabilities:**](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical__exploit_configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node represents the exploitation of weaknesses in how tmuxinator processes its configuration files. Success here opens up several high-risk attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [**2. [CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Commands into Configuration:**](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical__inject_malicious_commands_into_configuration.md)

This critical node focuses on the ability of an attacker to insert harmful commands into the tmuxinator configuration.

    *   **[CRITICAL] Inject into 'commands' section:**
        *   This involves inserting malicious commands directly into the `commands` array within a tmuxinator configuration file.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK] Execute arbitrary OS commands with tmuxinator's privileges:**
            *   An attacker can insert commands that will be executed with the same privileges as the user running `tmuxinator`.
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Developers might copy-paste commands without full understanding).
            *   Impact: High (Full system compromise possible).
            *   Effort: Low (Simple command injection).
            *   Skill Level: Low (Basic understanding of shell commands).
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on monitoring and logging).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Inject into 'pre' or 'post' hooks:**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_into_'pre'_or_'post'_hooks.md)

*   This involves inserting malicious commands into the `pre` or `post` hooks, which are executed before or after session creation, respectively.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Execute arbitrary OS commands before/after session creation:**
        *   Similar to injecting into the `commands` section, but these commands execute at different stages of session creation.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Similar to 'commands' injection).
        *   Impact: High (Full system compromise possible).
        *   Effort: Low (Simple command injection).
        *   Skill Level: Low (Basic understanding of shell commands).
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on monitoring and logging).

## Attack Tree Path: [**3. [CRITICAL] Introduce Malicious Files via Configuration:**](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical__introduce_malicious_files_via_configuration.md)

This critical node focuses on using the configuration file to introduce and execute malicious files on the system.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Download and execute malicious scripts:**
        *   An attacker can insert commands (e.g., using `wget` or `curl`) to download a malicious script from an external source and then execute it (e.g., using `bash` or `python`).
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Relatively straightforward if write access exists).
        *   Impact: High (Malware installation, backdoor).
        *   Effort: Low to Medium (Basic scripting and command knowledge).
        *   Skill Level: Low to Medium.
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on endpoint security and network monitoring).

## Attack Tree Path: [**4. [CRITICAL] Expose Sensitive Information in Configuration:**](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical__expose_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of storing sensitive data directly within the tmuxinator configuration files.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Store credentials or API keys directly in the YAML file:**
        *   Developers might inadvertently or for convenience store sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, or other credentials directly in the YAML configuration.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Developer oversight, convenience over security).
        *   Impact: High (Access to sensitive data, external service compromise).
        *   Effort: Low (Simply reading the configuration file).
        *   Skill Level: Low.
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low (If configuration files are accessible).

## Attack Tree Path: [**5. Social Engineering Targeting Tmuxinator Usage:**](./attack_tree_paths/5__social_engineering_targeting_tmuxinator_usage.md)

This branch focuses on exploiting the human element to compromise the application.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Trick User into Running Malicious Configuration:**
        *   An attacker can use social engineering techniques to convince a user to execute a malicious tmuxinator configuration file.
        *   Distribute a crafted tmuxinator configuration file: The attacker creates a seemingly legitimate but harmful configuration file.
        *   Execute malicious commands upon session creation: When the user runs the malicious configuration, the embedded commands are executed.
            *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (Depends on user awareness and trust).
            *   Impact: High (As per command injection).
            *   Effort: Low to Medium (Crafting the file and distributing it).
            *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (Basic understanding of tmuxinator and social engineering).
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low (If the user is not suspicious).
