# Threat Model Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Threat: [Malicious Command Injection via Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_command_injection_via_configuration_files.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Command Injection via Configuration Files

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the tmuxinator configuration files (`.yml`) injects malicious shell commands into the `pre`, `post`, or `before_script` sections of a project definition. When tmuxinator loads the configuration, these commands are directly executed by tmuxinator with the privileges of the user running it.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the host system. The attacker can potentially gain full control of the system, install malware, steal data, or disrupt operations.

**Affected Component:** tmuxinator's configuration loading and script execution logic, specifically when processing the `pre`, `post`, and `before_script` hooks defined in the `.yml` files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access controls on tmuxinator configuration files, ensuring only trusted users can modify them.
*   Perform regular code reviews of tmuxinator configuration files to identify any suspicious or malicious commands.
*   Consider using a configuration management system that tracks changes and allows for rollback.
*   Run tmuxinator with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration Files](./threats/sensitive_information_exposure_in_configuration_files.md)

**Threat:** Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration Files

**Description:** Developers inadvertently store sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal paths, directly within the tmuxinator configuration files. Tmuxinator reads these files to configure the tmux environment, making this information accessible if the files are not properly secured.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, and potential financial loss.

**Affected Component:** tmuxinator's configuration parsing and handling of `.yml` files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in tmuxinator configuration files.
*   Utilize environment variables (set securely outside of tmuxinator configuration) or secure secret management solutions to handle sensitive credentials.
*   Implement proper access controls on the configuration files.
*   Regularly scan configuration files for accidentally committed secrets using tools designed for this purpose.

## Threat: [Path Traversal/Injection in Configuration Files](./threats/path_traversalinjection_in_configuration_files.md)

**Threat:** Path Traversal/Injection in Configuration Files

**Description:** An attacker manipulates path definitions within the tmuxinator configuration (e.g., in `root`, `command`, or script paths) to access or execute files outside of the intended project directory. Tmuxinator uses these paths to navigate the file system and execute commands.

**Impact:** The attacker could potentially read sensitive files, execute arbitrary code outside the intended scope, or overwrite critical system files, leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** tmuxinator's handling of path-related directives within the `.yml` configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using user-provided input directly in path definitions within the configuration.
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of any paths used in the configuration before tmuxinator uses them.
*   Use absolute paths where possible to limit the scope of access.
*   Ensure the user running tmuxinator has only the necessary permissions to access the intended project directories.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Tmuxinator Itself](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_tmuxinator_itself.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Tmuxinator Itself

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the tmuxinator codebase. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted configuration files or through other means that interact with tmuxinator's functionality.

**Impact:** The impact would depend on the nature of the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running tmuxinator.

**Affected Component:** The tmuxinator codebase itself.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep tmuxinator updated to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with tmuxinator.
*   Consider contributing to or supporting security audits of the tmuxinator project.
