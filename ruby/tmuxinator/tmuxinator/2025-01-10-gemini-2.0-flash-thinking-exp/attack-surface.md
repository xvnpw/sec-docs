# Attack Surface Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**  tmuxinator relies on YAML configuration files to define session layouts and commands. If these files are compromised, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
*   **How tmuxinator Contributes:** tmuxinator parses and executes the commands specified within these configuration files. It trusts the content of these files to be benign.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies `~/.tmuxinator/my_project.yml` to include:
    ```yaml
    name: my_project
    windows:
      - editor:
          layout: main-vertical
          panes:
            - echo "Malicious payload executed!" > /tmp/evil.txt
    ```
    When the user runs `mux start my_project`, the `echo` command will be executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure file permissions on tmuxinator configuration directories (e.g., `~/.tmuxinator`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmuxinator`) to restrict write access to trusted users.
    *   Regularly audit configuration files for unexpected or suspicious changes.
    *   Store configuration files in version control systems and review changes carefully.
    *   Educate users about the risks of running tmuxinator configurations from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If user-supplied data or external input is directly incorporated into commands within the configuration files without proper sanitization or escaping, it can lead to command injection.
*   **How tmuxinator Contributes:** tmuxinator executes the commands as they are defined in the configuration. If these commands are dynamically generated based on external input, it can be vulnerable.
*   **Example:**  Imagine a script dynamically generating a tmuxinator config based on user input:
    ```python
    user_input = input("Enter window name: ")
    config_content = f"""
    name: dynamic_project
    windows:
      - '{user_input}':
          panes:
            - echo "Window created with name: {user_input}"
    """
    # If user_input is "; rm -rf /", this will be executed.
    ```
    If a user inputs `; rm -rf /`, tmuxinator will attempt to execute this as part of the window name, leading to disaster.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data deletion, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly incorporating untrusted data into command strings within configuration files.
    *   If dynamic configuration generation is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.
    *   Use parameterized commands or secure command construction techniques where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly within tmuxinator configuration files.
*   **How tmuxinator Contributes:** tmuxinator reads and stores the content of these files, making the sensitive information accessible if the files are compromised.
*   **Example:** A configuration file might contain:
    ```yaml
    name: api_project
    windows:
      - api_client:
          panes:
            - export API_KEY="super_secret_key" && run_api_client
    ```
    If this file is accessible to unauthorized users, the API key is exposed.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
    *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables managed securely).
    *   If environment variables are used, ensure they are set up securely and not easily accessible to unauthorized processes.
