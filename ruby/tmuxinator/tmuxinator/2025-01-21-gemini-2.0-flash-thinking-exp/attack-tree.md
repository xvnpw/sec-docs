## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via tmuxinator [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_tmuxinator__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through exploiting tmuxinator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control Over tmuxinator Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_over_tmuxinator_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This is a pivotal point in the attack. If the attacker can control the tmuxinator configuration, they can dictate its behavior and use it as a stepping stone for further attacks. This node is critical because it unlocks the ability to execute malicious commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Modify Configuration Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_modify_configuration_files__high_risk_path_.md)

This attack vector involves the attacker directly altering the tmuxinator configuration files (e.g., `~/.tmuxinator/*.yml`). This can be achieved through:
    * **Gain Unauthorized File System Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker gains access to the file system where the configuration files are stored without proper authorization. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in other services, using stolen credentials, or through physical access to the system. Once access is gained, the attacker can directly edit the YAML files to inject malicious commands or modify existing settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized File System Access [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_file_system_access__high_risk_path_.md)

The attacker gains access to the file system where the configuration files are stored without proper authorization. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in other services, using stolen credentials, or through physical access to the system. Once access is gained, the attacker can directly edit the YAML files to inject malicious commands or modify existing settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Malicious Configuration for Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_malicious_configuration_for_execution__high_risk_path_.md)

Once the attacker controls the configuration, they can use it to execute malicious actions when tmuxinator is run. This is a direct consequence of successfully compromising the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands into `pre`, `post`, or `panes` directives [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_into__pre____post___or__panes__directives__high_risk_path_.md)

The `pre`, `post`, and `panes` directives in the tmuxinator configuration allow specifying commands to be executed at different stages of session creation. This is a prime target for injecting malicious shell commands.
    * **Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]:** By inserting malicious commands into the configuration directives, the attacker can execute any command that the user running tmuxinator has permissions for. This allows for a wide range of malicious activities, including installing backdoors, modifying files, or exfiltrating data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Shell Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_shell_commands__high_risk_path_.md)

By inserting malicious commands into the configuration directives, the attacker can execute any command that the user running tmuxinator has permissions for. This allows for a wide range of malicious activities, including installing backdoors, modifying files, or exfiltrating data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Application Compromise [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_application_compromise__high_risk_path_.md)

This represents the successful compromise of the application itself, achieved through the exploitation of tmuxinator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Remote Code Execution on the Application Server [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_remote_code_execution_on_the_application_server__high_risk_path_.md)

This is a significant step towards full application compromise. By executing commands on the server, the attacker gains control over the application's environment.
    * **Execute commands with application user privileges [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the user running tmuxinator has the same or similar privileges as the application, the attacker can directly execute commands that affect the application's functionality, data, or security.
    * **Exfiltrate sensitive data via executed commands [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Once the attacker has the ability to execute commands on the server, they can use this access to steal sensitive information stored on the server or accessible to the application. This could involve accessing files, databases, or other resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute commands with application user privileges [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_commands_with_application_user_privileges__high_risk_path_.md)

If the user running tmuxinator has the same or similar privileges as the application, the attacker can directly execute commands that affect the application's functionality, data, or security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate sensitive data via executed commands [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_via_executed_commands__high_risk_path_.md)

Once the attacker has the ability to execute commands on the server, they can use this access to steal sensitive information stored on the server or accessible to the application. This could involve accessing files, databases, or other resources.
