# Threat Model Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Threat: [Malicious Command Injection in Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_command_injection_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Command Injection in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands into a Tmuxinator configuration file (`.tmuxinator.yml`). This could occur if the configuration file is sourced from an untrusted location or if a developer's machine is compromised, leading to the modification of the configuration file. When Tmuxinator loads the configuration, it will execute these injected commands.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running Tmuxinator. This could lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration file parsing and execution of commands defined in `panes`, `commands`, `before_start`, and `after_start` directives.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access and permissions to Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   Implement code reviews for any changes to configuration files.
        *   Avoid sourcing configuration files from untrusted or external sources.
        *   Use a configuration management system with version control and access controls for Tmuxinator configurations.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan configuration files for suspicious commands.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or database credentials, directly within the Tmuxinator configuration file. An attacker gaining access to this file could retrieve these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, and potential compromise of other systems or accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration file storage and retrieval.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store sensitive information directly in Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to handle sensitive data.
        *   Ensure configuration files are not committed to public version control repositories without proper redaction or using `.gitignore`.
        *   Implement appropriate file permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Configuration File Manipulation Leading to Command Execution](./threats/configuration_file_manipulation_leading_to_command_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Manipulation Leading to Command Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains write access to the file system where the Tmuxinator configuration file resides could modify it to include malicious commands. When Tmuxinator is subsequently run, these commands will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands with the user's privileges, potentially leading to system compromise, data loss, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration file loading and parsing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong file system permissions to restrict write access to Tmuxinator configuration files.
        *   Regularly audit file permissions.
        *   Harden the system against other potential vulnerabilities that could grant attackers file system access.

## Threat: [Execution of Untrusted Scripts via `before_start` or `after_start` Hooks](./threats/execution_of_untrusted_scripts_via__before_start__or__after_start__hooks.md)

*   **Threat:** Execution of Untrusted Scripts via `before_start` or `after_start` Hooks
    *   **Description:** Tmuxinator allows defining `before_start` and `after_start` hooks, which execute arbitrary shell commands. If a configuration file from an untrusted source is used, or if a compromised configuration file is loaded, these hooks could execute malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands with the user's privileges, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Execution of `before_start` and `after_start` hooks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using `before_start` and `after_start` hooks.
        *   Thoroughly review any commands used in these hooks.
        *   Avoid executing commands or scripts from untrusted sources within these hooks.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for any parameters used in these hooks.
