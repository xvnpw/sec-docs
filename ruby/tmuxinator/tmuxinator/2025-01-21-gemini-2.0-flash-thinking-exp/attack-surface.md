# Attack Surface Analysis for tmuxinator/tmuxinator

## Attack Surface: [Malicious YAML Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_yaml_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  A crafted YAML configuration file can exploit vulnerabilities in the YAML parsing library used by tmuxinator.
*   **How tmuxinator contributes to the attack surface:** Tmuxinator relies on parsing YAML files to define project configurations, including commands to execute.
*   **Example:** A malicious YAML file could contain directives that, when parsed, lead to arbitrary code execution due to a vulnerability in the YAML parser. For instance, exploiting a known vulnerability in `psych` or `syck` to execute shell commands.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running tmuxinator.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Ensure tmuxinator uses an up-to-date and patched version of the YAML parsing library. Consider input validation or sandboxing of the parsing process.
    *   **Users:** Only load tmuxinator configuration files from trusted sources. Carefully review configuration files before using them, especially those obtained from external sources.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Configuration Hooks](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_configuration_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** The `before_script`, `pre`, and `post` hooks in the tmuxinator configuration allow execution of arbitrary shell commands.
*   **How tmuxinator contributes to the attack surface:** Tmuxinator directly executes the commands specified in these hooks.
*   **Example:** A malicious configuration file could contain a `before_script` like `rm -rf /` which would be executed when the project is started.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's system due to arbitrary command execution with the user's privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  While difficult to fully mitigate given the intended functionality, consider warnings or stricter validation of commands.
    *   **Users:**  **Never** load tmuxinator configuration files from untrusted sources. Carefully review the `before_script`, `pre`, and `post` sections of any configuration file before using it. Be extremely cautious about commands that involve file system modifications or network access.
