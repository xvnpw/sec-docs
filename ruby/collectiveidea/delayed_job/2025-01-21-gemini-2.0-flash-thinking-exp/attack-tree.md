## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via Delayed Job [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_delayed_job__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful execution of arbitrary code allows the attacker to take complete control of the application, access sensitive data, manipulate information, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Job Deserialization Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_job_deserialization_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: This path focuses on exploiting the inherent risks associated with deserializing untrusted data in Ruby using `Marshal.load`. Attackers craft malicious serialized Ruby objects that, when deserialized by the Delayed Job worker, execute arbitrary code. This often involves leveraging existing classes within the application or its dependencies to perform malicious actions.
* Why High-Risk: The combination of the critical impact (arbitrary code execution) and the potential for widespread vulnerability due to the nature of Ruby's serialization makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Serialized Object [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_serialized_object__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker's core action in exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities. This involves crafting a specific serialized payload designed to trigger code execution upon deserialization. The complexity of crafting the payload can vary, but readily available tools and techniques exist.
* Why Critical: Successful injection of a malicious serialized object is the direct precursor to arbitrary code execution via deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via Insecure Job Creation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__via_insecure_job_creation__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: This path highlights vulnerabilities in how the application creates and enqueues Delayed Jobs. If the application allows user input to directly influence the arguments passed to a Delayed Job, and these arguments are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject a malicious serialized object as part of the job's payload.
* Why High-Risk: This is a common vulnerability in web applications. Developers may not always consider the security implications of passing unsanitized user input to background jobs. The ease of exploitation and the direct path to code execution make this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] User-Controlled Input in Job Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__user-controlled_input_in_job_arguments.md)

* Attack Vector: The application directly uses user-provided data as arguments when creating Delayed Jobs. This lack of separation between user input and internal application logic creates an opportunity for injection attacks.
* Why Critical: This is a fundamental flaw that directly enables the injection of malicious data into the Delayed Job processing pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] No Input Sanitization/Validation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__no_input_sanitizationvalidation.md)

* Attack Vector: The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided data before using it in Delayed Job arguments. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary data, including malicious serialized objects, without restriction.
* Why Critical: This is a basic but crucial security control. Its absence directly leads to the success of injection attacks, including deserialization exploits.
