# Attack Surface Analysis for collectiveidea/delayed_job

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Job Argument Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_job_argument_deserialization.md)

**Description:** Delayed Job serializes job arguments (often using YAML or JSON) for storage. When a worker processes the job, these arguments are deserialized. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, malicious payloads embedded in the serialized data can be executed.

**How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job's core functionality relies on serializing and deserializing job arguments to persist and execute tasks asynchronously.

**Example:** An attacker could create a job with a YAML payload in the arguments that, upon deserialization, instantiates a dangerous object leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain control of the worker process and potentially the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid YAML for serialization:** Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON, which are less prone to object instantiation vulnerabilities.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided data before using it as job arguments.
*   **Restrict Deserialization:** If using YAML is necessary, explore options to restrict the classes that can be instantiated during deserialization (e.g., using `safe_load` in Psych with allowed classes).
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `delayed_job` gem and its dependencies updated to patch any known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Job Injection via Database Access](./attack_surfaces/malicious_job_injection_via_database_access.md)

**Description:** If an attacker gains write access to the `delayed_jobs` database table (e.g., through a separate SQL injection vulnerability in the application), they can directly insert malicious job records.

**How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job relies on the database as its central queue. Compromising the database allows direct manipulation of the job queue.

**Example:** An attacker injects a job with a handler that executes arbitrary shell commands on the worker server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS) by flooding the queue, data manipulation or exfiltration depending on the malicious job's actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Database Access:** Implement robust security measures to protect the database, including strong passwords, network segmentation, and principle of least privilege for database users.
*   **Prevent SQL Injection:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that could lead to database compromise.
*   **Database Monitoring and Auditing:** Monitor database activity for suspicious insertions or modifications to the `delayed_jobs` table.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Job Handlers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_job_handlers.md)

**Description:** The code within the job handler itself might contain vulnerabilities if it processes data from job arguments unsafely or interacts with external systems insecurely.

**How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job executes the code defined in the job handler. If this code is flawed, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** A job handler takes a URL from the arguments and makes an HTTP request without proper validation, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Command Injection if the handler executes shell commands based on job arguments, or other vulnerabilities depending on the handler's logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when writing job handlers, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding the execution of arbitrary commands based on external input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure worker processes run with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security reviews of job handler code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
