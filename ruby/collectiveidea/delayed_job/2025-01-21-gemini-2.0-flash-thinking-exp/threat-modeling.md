# Threat Model Analysis for collectiveidea/delayed_job

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

* **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data
    * **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the serialized job data stored in the database (if access controls are weak) or through vulnerabilities in job creation logic. When a `Delayed::Worker` processes this job, deserialization of the malicious object leads to code execution on the worker server. The attacker might craft a serialized object that, upon being unserialized, executes arbitrary commands.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker servers, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Worker`, specifically the deserialization process (e.g., using `Marshal.load` or similar).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data used as job arguments *before* enqueuing the job.
        * **Consider Safer Serialization Formats:** Explore alternatives to Ruby's `Marshal` if possible, such as JSON or other formats that are less prone to arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
        * **Strong Database Access Controls:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the database used by `delayed_job`. Restrict access to the `delayed_jobs` table.
        * **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that handles job creation and processing for potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Updates:** Keep all dependencies, including Ruby and any gems used for serialization, up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Object Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/object_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Object Injection Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Even with seemingly safe data, vulnerabilities in the application's classes used within the job arguments could be exploited during deserialization by `Delayed::Worker`. A crafted serialized object could instantiate objects in unexpected states or trigger unintended method calls with malicious consequences. The attacker leverages existing application classes in unintended ways through the `delayed_job` serialization mechanism.
    * **Impact:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), data manipulation, or other unintended application behavior depending on the vulnerable classes.
    * **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Worker`, specifically the deserialization process and the interaction with application classes used within job arguments.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing classes that might be used in delayed jobs. Avoid methods with dangerous side effects that could be triggered unexpectedly.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design classes with minimal public interfaces and restrict access to sensitive methods.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application code, paying close attention to classes used in delayed jobs.
        * **Consider Whitelisting:** If feasible, implement a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization within the `delayed_job` processing.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Creation](./threats/unauthorized_job_creation.md)

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Job Creation
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's job creation logic or gain unauthorized access to enqueue jobs directly using `Delayed::Job.enqueue`. This allows them to create a large number of malicious or resource-intensive jobs, overwhelming the worker pool and potentially leading to a denial-of-service. The attacker abuses the `delayed_job` queuing mechanism.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on background processing capabilities, potentially impacting core application functionality that relies on delayed jobs.
    * **Affected Component:** The `Delayed::Job.enqueue` method and the application logic that calls it.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Robust Authorization Checks:** Implement strong authentication and authorization checks before allowing users or processes to create delayed jobs.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on job creation to prevent a single attacker from overwhelming the system.
        * **Input Validation:** Validate all input parameters used for job creation to prevent the creation of jobs with malicious or unexpected arguments.
        * **Secure API Endpoints:** If job creation is exposed through an API, ensure the API endpoints are properly secured with authentication and authorization.

## Threat: [Job Data Leakage](./threats/job_data_leakage.md)

* **Threat:** Job Data Leakage
    * **Description:** The arguments and potentially sensitive data associated with delayed jobs are stored in the database in a serialized format managed by `delayed_job`. If the database is compromised due to weak access controls or other vulnerabilities, this sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized parties. The attacker gains access to the persistent job queue managed by `delayed_job`.
    * **Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive user data, API keys, or other confidential information.
    * **Affected Component:** The database used by `delayed_job` to store the `delayed_jobs` table.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Database Access Controls:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the database. Restrict access to the `delayed_jobs` table to only necessary services.
        * **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt the database used by `delayed_job` at rest to protect data even if the storage media is compromised.
        * **Data Minimization:** Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in job arguments if possible. Consider using references to secure data stores or encrypting sensitive data before serialization.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit database security configurations and access logs.

## Threat: [Compromised Worker Executes Malicious Code](./threats/compromised_worker_executes_malicious_code.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised Worker Executes Malicious Code
    * **Description:** If a `Delayed::Worker` process is compromised (through vulnerabilities in dependencies, the operating system, or other means), it could execute malicious code contained within a delayed job. This is a consequence of a compromised worker environment processing jobs from the `delayed_job` queue.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the compromised worker server, potentially leading to further lateral movement within the network or data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** The `Delayed::Worker` process and the environment it runs in.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the worker server operating system, Ruby interpreter, and all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        * **Secure Worker Configuration:** Harden the worker server configuration by disabling unnecessary services, using strong passwords, and implementing firewalls.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Containerization:** Consider using containerization technologies (like Docker) to isolate worker processes and limit the impact of a compromise.
        * **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Implement IDS to detect and alert on suspicious activity on worker servers.
