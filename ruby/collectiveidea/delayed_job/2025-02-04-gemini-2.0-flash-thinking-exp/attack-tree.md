## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Delayed Job [ROOT - CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_delayed_job__root_-_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. Successful exploitation of any of the paths below leads to this compromise. The compromise can manifest as:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Data breach or unauthorized data access.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Manipulation of application logic and functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. User-Controlled Data Directly Used in Job Arguments [1.1.1.a] [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__user-controlled_data_directly_used_in_job_arguments__1_1_1_a___high-risk_path_continues_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application's code that enqueues Delayed Job jobs takes user-provided input and directly uses it as arguments for the job.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Lack of input validation and sanitization on user-provided data before it's used as job arguments.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   Attacker crafts malicious input that, when used as a job argument, will cause unintended and harmful actions when the job is processed.
        *   Example: If a job processes files based on a filename argument, an attacker could provide a path like `"; rm -rf / #"` to execute arbitrary commands on the server when the job runs.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to Command Injection in job handlers (see point 5), File System Manipulation vulnerabilities, or Business Logic vulnerabilities depending on how the job arguments are used in the job handler code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Using `Marshal` or similar unsafe deserialization without sanitization [2.1.1.a] [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__using__marshal__or_similar_unsafe_deserialization_without_sanitization__2_1_1_a___critical_node___27069766.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Delayed Job, or the application's custom job handling logic, uses insecure deserialization methods like `Marshal` (in Ruby) to deserialize job arguments.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Inherent insecurity of `Marshal` and similar deserialization methods when used on untrusted data. These methods can be tricked into instantiating arbitrary objects and executing code during the deserialization process itself.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   Attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload (e.g., using `Marshal.dump` in Ruby with a payload designed for RCE).
        *   This malicious payload is injected as a job argument (e.g., via vulnerable enqueueing logic - see point 2, or direct database manipulation).
        *   When the Delayed Job worker processes the job, it deserializes the malicious argument using `Marshal`.
        *   During deserialization, the crafted payload executes arbitrary code on the worker server.
    *   **Impact:** Direct and immediate Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker server. This is a critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Job Handler Executes External Commands with Unsanitized Job Arguments [2.2.1.a] [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__job_handler_executes_external_commands_with_unsanitized_job_arguments__2_2_1_a___critical_node__h_171efbc6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The code within a Delayed Job handler executes external system commands (e.g., using `system()`, `exec()`, backticks in Ruby).
    *   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection vulnerability due to the job handler constructing shell commands by directly incorporating unsanitized job arguments.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   Attacker injects malicious job arguments (e.g., via vulnerable enqueueing logic - see point 2, or direct database manipulation).
        *   The job handler, when processing the job, uses these malicious arguments to construct and execute a shell command.
        *   The attacker's malicious input is interpreted as shell commands, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker server.
    *   **Impact:** Direct and immediate Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker server. This is a critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Worker Process Runs as Root or Administrator [3.1.1] [CRITICAL NODE - Amplifies other RCEs]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__worker_process_runs_as_root_or_administrator__3_1_1___critical_node_-_amplifies_other_rces_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The Delayed Job worker processes are configured to run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root or Administrator user).
    *   **Vulnerability:** Misconfiguration of worker process user privileges. Running with elevated privileges is generally unnecessary and increases the impact of other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   This is not an attack vector in itself, but rather a configuration issue that amplifies the impact of other successful exploits, particularly Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   If an attacker achieves RCE through any of the other vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection), and the worker process is running as root, the attacker gains root-level access to the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Significantly increases the impact of other vulnerabilities. If RCE is achieved in a worker running as root, it leads to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the entire server, access all data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
