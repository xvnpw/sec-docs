## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_job_arguments.md)

**Attack Surface: Unsafe Deserialization of Job Arguments**

* **Description:** Maliciously crafted data within job arguments can be deserialized and executed by worker processes, leading to arbitrary code execution.
* **How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job serializes job arguments for storage and later deserializes them when a worker picks up the job. If insecure deserialization methods (like `Marshal.load` without proper sanitization) are used, this process becomes a vulnerability.
* **Example:** An attacker manipulates an input field that eventually populates a delayed job's arguments. This argument contains serialized Ruby code that, when deserialized by the worker, executes a shell command to compromise the server.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker server.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid insecure deserialization: Prefer safer alternatives like JSON or explicitly defined serialization/deserialization methods that sanitize input.
    * Input validation and sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data that will be used as arguments for delayed jobs *before* enqueueing them.
    * Principle of least privilege: Ensure worker processes run with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    * Regular security audits: Review the codebase for instances of deserialization and ensure proper security measures are in place.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Job Enqueueing](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_job_enqueueing.md)

**Attack Surface: Denial of Service (DoS) through Job Enqueueing**

* **Description:** An attacker can flood the job queue with a large number of resource-intensive or malicious jobs, overwhelming worker processes and potentially crashing the application.
* **How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job provides a mechanism for easily queuing background tasks. If the enqueueing process is not properly secured or rate-limited, it can be abused for DoS attacks.
* **Example:** An attacker repeatedly submits requests that trigger the enqueueing of computationally expensive jobs, rapidly filling the queue and causing worker processes to become overloaded and unresponsive.
* **Impact:** Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, and potential infrastructure instability.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Rate limiting on enqueueing: Implement rate limits on API endpoints or functionalities that trigger job creation to prevent excessive job submissions.
    * Authentication and authorization: Ensure only authorized users or systems can enqueue jobs.
    * Job prioritization and queue management: Implement mechanisms to prioritize important jobs and potentially discard or delay less critical ones during periods of high load.
    * Resource monitoring and alerting: Monitor worker process resource usage and set up alerts to detect potential DoS attacks early.
    * Input validation: Validate inputs that lead to job creation to prevent the enqueueing of jobs with excessively large or malicious payloads.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure through Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_through_job_arguments.md)

**Attack Surface: Data Exposure through Job Arguments**

* **Description:** Sensitive information might be inadvertently included in job arguments, which are then stored in the database or other backend, potentially exposing this data if the storage is compromised.
* **How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job persists job arguments in a storage mechanism. If developers are not careful about what data is included in these arguments, sensitive information can be stored insecurely.
* **Example:** A developer passes a user's password or API key as an argument to a delayed job. This information is then stored in the database, and if the database is breached, this sensitive data is exposed.
* **Impact:** Confidential data breach, privacy violations.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid storing sensitive data in job arguments: Prefer passing identifiers and retrieving sensitive data from secure stores within the job execution context.
    * Data encryption at rest: Encrypt the delayed job storage backend (e.g., database) to protect data even if the storage is compromised.
    * Regular security audits: Review job creation logic to identify and remove instances of sensitive data being passed as arguments.
    * Data minimization: Only include the necessary information in job arguments.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Job Execution Context](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_job_execution_context.md)

**Attack Surface: Abuse of Job Execution Context**

* **Description:** If an attacker can inject malicious code through job arguments, this code will execute with the same permissions as the worker process, potentially allowing access to sensitive resources or actions within the application's context.
* **How Delayed Job Contributes:** Delayed Job executes jobs within the application's environment. If vulnerabilities like unsafe deserialization are present, this execution context can be abused.
* **Example:** By exploiting unsafe deserialization, an attacker executes code within a delayed job that interacts with internal APIs or databases, performing actions they are not authorized to do directly through the web application.
* **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to resources, data modification.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Apply mitigations for unsafe deserialization: Preventing code injection is the primary defense.
    * Principle of least privilege for worker processes: Run worker processes with the minimum necessary permissions.
    * Regular security audits: Review the codebase for potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited through delayed job execution.
