## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject a malicious serialized object into the delayed job queue, which, upon deserialization by a worker, executes arbitrary code.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Payload into Delayed Job Data**
    * **Attack Vector:**  The point where the attacker introduces the malicious serialized data into the delayed job system.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Directly Modify Job Data in Database:** If the attacker gains access to the database (e.g., through SQL injection in other parts of the application), they can directly modify the `handler` column in the `delayed_jobs` table to contain a malicious serialized object.
        * **Indirectly Inject via Application Vulnerability:**
            * **Exploit Parameter Tampering during Job Creation:** If the application allows user input to influence the arguments of a delayed job, an attacker might manipulate these parameters to inject a malicious serialized object.
            * **Exploit Business Logic Flaws in Job Processing:** Flaws in how the application handles job creation could allow an attacker to craft specific requests that result in the creation of jobs with malicious serialized arguments.
            * **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Job Data:** Lack of proper sanitization or validation of data that becomes part of the serialized job arguments can allow injection of malicious payloads.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Database Access Vulnerability (within "Directly Modify Job Data in Database")**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities like SQL injection to gain direct access to the database and modify job data.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Deserialization of Malicious Payload by Worker**
    * **Attack Vector:** The point where the worker process attempts to deserialize the malicious payload, leading to code execution.
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker simply needs to wait for a worker process to pick up and process the compromised job. When the worker deserializes the malicious payload, the embedded code will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Job Queue Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_job_queue_manipulation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject entirely new, malicious job definitions into the delayed job queue that, when processed, execute arbitrary code.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Job Definition**
    * **Attack Vector:** The point where the attacker inserts a completely new, malicious job record into the `delayed_jobs` table.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Directly Insert Malicious Job into Database:** If the attacker gains database access, they can insert a completely new row into the `delayed_jobs` table with a `handler` that executes malicious code. This could involve crafting a `handler` that instantiates a class and calls a method with attacker-controlled arguments.
        * **Indirectly Inject via Application Vulnerability:**
            * **Exploit API Endpoints for Job Creation (if exposed):** If the application exposes API endpoints for creating delayed jobs without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker can directly call these endpoints to inject malicious jobs.
            * **Exploit Lack of Authorization/Authentication on Job Creation:** If the application doesn't properly control who can create delayed jobs, an attacker might be able to create them through legitimate application interfaces.
            * **Exploit Race Conditions in Job Scheduling:** In some scenarios, attackers might exploit race conditions in the job scheduling logic to insert malicious jobs or modify existing ones before they are processed.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Database Access Vulnerability (within "Directly Insert Malicious Job into Database")**
    * **Attack Vector:** Leveraging vulnerabilities like SQL injection to gain direct access to the database and insert malicious job definitions.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Execution of Malicious Job**
    * **Attack Vector:** The point where the worker process picks up and executes the attacker-defined malicious job.
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker waits for a worker process to pick up and execute the injected malicious job.
