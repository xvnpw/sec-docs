# Threat Model Analysis for collectiveidea/delayed_job

## Threat: [Job Data Tampering](./threats/job_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might directly modify the serialized job data stored in the database within the `delayed_job`'s managed table. This involves altering attributes of the `Delayed::Job` model, such as `handler` (containing serialized arguments and the job class). They could achieve this by gaining unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Modified job data could lead to unintended actions being performed by the `Delayed::Worker`, data corruption, or even the execution of arbitrary code if the job logic is not properly secured.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Job` model (database record).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for database access to the table used by `delayed_job`.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within the job's `handler` column before it's stored by `delayed_job`.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or signatures) for the `handler` data to detect tampering before `Delayed::Worker` processes the job.

## Threat: [Job Queue Poisoning](./threats/job_queue_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject a large number of malicious or unwanted jobs directly into the `delayed_jobs` table, bypassing the application's intended job creation flow. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow direct database manipulation. These malicious jobs, managed by `delayed_job`, could be designed to consume excessive resources or execute harmful code when picked up by `Delayed::Worker`.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate jobs handled by `delayed_job`, resource exhaustion on worker servers managed by `Delayed::Worker`, potential execution of malicious code within the worker environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Job` model (database record), the database table managed by `delayed_job`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks at the database level to restrict who can insert records into the `delayed_jobs` table.
        *   Monitor the `delayed_jobs` table for unusual spikes in size or unexpected job types.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Job Data](./threats/information_disclosure_through_job_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information might be inadvertently stored within the `handler` column of the `Delayed::Job` model. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the database where `delayed_job` stores its jobs, this information could be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive business data, personal information, or credentials stored within the `delayed_job`'s data, leading to privacy violations, compliance issues, and potential further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Job` model (specifically the `handler` attribute).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly within the `handler` of `Delayed::Job` records.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before it is serialized and stored in the `handler` by `delayed_job`. Ensure decryption happens securely within the `Delayed::Worker`.
        *   Ensure proper access controls are in place for the database used by `delayed_job`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Malicious Jobs)](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion__malicious_jobs_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create jobs that, when processed by `Delayed::Worker`, are intentionally designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network). These jobs would be stored and managed by `delayed_job` until picked up by a worker.
    *   **Impact:** `Delayed::Worker` processes become overloaded and unresponsive, preventing legitimate jobs managed by `delayed_job` from being processed, leading to a denial of service for the application's background tasks handled by this gem.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Worker` (processing jobs managed by the gem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits for processes running `Delayed::Worker` (e.g., memory limits, CPU quotas).
        *   Monitor resource usage of `Delayed::Worker` processes and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Implement timeouts for job execution within the `Delayed::Worker` configuration to prevent indefinitely running jobs.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/code_injection_through_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the serialization format used by `delayed_job` (e.g., the default Ruby Marshal format) is vulnerable to deserialization attacks, an attacker could craft malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized by `Delayed::Worker`, execute arbitrary code. This is a critical vulnerability within the core functionality of `delayed_job`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker server running `Delayed::Worker`, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences directly stemming from the way `delayed_job` handles job data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Serialization and deserialization mechanisms within `Delayed::Job`, potentially related to `YAML` or `Marshal` usage within the gem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `delayed_job` gem and its dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities related to serialization.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats if vulnerabilities in the default format are a concern within the `delayed_job` context.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization even for deserialized data processed by `Delayed::Worker`.

## Threat: [Worker Process Compromise](./threats/worker_process_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If the `Delayed::Worker` processes themselves are compromised (e.g., through vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software running on the worker servers), an attacker could gain access to sensitive data processed by the jobs managed by `delayed_job`, manipulate job execution within the `Delayed::Worker` lifecycle, or use the worker processes for other malicious activities.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data handled by `delayed_job`, manipulation of background tasks managed by the gem, potential use of worker infrastructure for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Delayed::Worker` processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices for any custom code executed within the `Delayed::Worker` environment.
        *   Harden the operating system and other software running on the worker servers hosting `Delayed::Worker`.
        *   Implement proper network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to worker servers running `Delayed::Worker`.
        *   Regularly update the operating system and software on worker servers to patch security vulnerabilities affecting the environment where `Delayed::Worker` runs.
