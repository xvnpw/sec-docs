# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Craft YAML Payload (delayed_job)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by malicious YAML payloads targeting applications using the `delayed_job` gem, specifically focusing on how an attacker can craft such a payload to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).  We aim to identify the specific vulnerabilities within `delayed_job` (and its interaction with Ruby's YAML parsing) that enable this attack, analyze the techniques attackers might use, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to prevent this critical vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:** Applications using the `delayed_job` gem for background job processing.  We assume the application uses YAML for serializing job arguments or handler objects.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The crafting and injection of a malicious YAML payload.  We are *not* analyzing how the payload is delivered (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting); we assume the attacker has a means to submit data that will be processed by `delayed_job`.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Unsafe deserialization of YAML data within `delayed_job` or the application's interaction with it.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.
*   **Library Versions:** We will consider the general vulnerability landscape, but special attention will be given to known vulnerable versions and the evolution of mitigations in `delayed_job` and related libraries (like `psych`, Ruby's YAML parser).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Examine existing vulnerability reports (CVEs), blog posts, security advisories, and research papers related to YAML deserialization vulnerabilities in Ruby and `delayed_job`.
2.  **Code Review:** Analyze the relevant source code of `delayed_job` (and potentially `psych`) to understand how YAML is handled, particularly the deserialization process and any existing security measures.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Construct a simplified, safe, and ethical PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability in a controlled environment.  This will involve creating a basic `delayed_job` setup and crafting a YAML payload that triggers a benign action (e.g., writing to a file) instead of full RCE.  This step is crucial for understanding the precise mechanics of the attack.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate existing mitigation strategies (e.g., `safe_yaml`, whitelisting, blacklisting, input validation) and propose best practices for preventing this vulnerability.
5.  **Threat Modeling:** Consider different attacker profiles and their potential motivations and capabilities to refine the risk assessment.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Craft YAML Payload

### 4.1. Vulnerability Explanation

The core vulnerability lies in the unsafe deserialization of YAML data.  Ruby's `YAML.load` (and older versions of `Psych.load`) can, by default, instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects based on the YAML input.  This is because YAML allows specifying the class of an object using the `!ruby/object:` tag.  If an attacker can control the YAML input that `delayed_job` processes, they can craft a payload that instructs the parser to create instances of specific classes and call methods on them.

`delayed_job` stores job information, including arguments and potentially custom handler objects, in a serialized format (often in a database).  When a job is dequeued, this serialized data is deserialized to reconstruct the job object and its associated data.  If the serialization format is YAML, and the application doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the deserialization process, this is where the vulnerability is triggered.

### 4.2. Gadget Chains

The attacker's goal is to find a "gadget chain" â€“ a sequence of object instantiations and method calls that, when triggered during deserialization, lead to RCE.  These chains often exploit:

*   **`Kernel#open`:**  A classic gadget.  If an attacker can control the argument to `Kernel.open`, they can execute arbitrary shell commands (e.g., `!ruby/object:OpenStruct { table: { :url: '|whoami' } }`).  This is often the final step in a gadget chain.
*   **`ERB` (Embedded Ruby):**  `ERB` templates can be used to execute Ruby code.  If an attacker can inject an `ERB` object with a malicious template, they can achieve RCE.
*   **`ActiveRecord` (if used):**  Certain `ActiveRecord` methods, particularly those related to serialization or callbacks, might be exploitable.
*   **Custom Application Classes:**  The attacker might leverage classes specific to the application if they have methods that can be abused (e.g., a method that writes to a file based on user-supplied data).
*   **`Psych` Specific Gadgets:** There have been vulnerabilities specific to the `psych` YAML parser itself, allowing for code execution even with some restrictions in place.

### 4.3. Example Payload (Simplified, Non-RCE)

This is a *simplified* example to illustrate the concept.  It does *not* achieve RCE but demonstrates how an attacker can control object instantiation.  A real RCE payload would be more complex and depend on the specific application and available gadgets.

```yaml
!ruby/object:OpenStruct
table:
  :message: "This file was created by a YAML payload."
  :filename: "/tmp/yaml_test.txt"
  :write_to_file: !ruby/object:Proc
    :call: !ruby/method:File.write
      - !ruby/object:OpenStruct
        table:
          :filename: "/tmp/yaml_test.txt"
          :message: "This file was created by a YAML payload."
```

**Explanation:**

*   `!ruby/object:OpenStruct`:  Creates an instance of `OpenStruct`, a simple class for creating objects with arbitrary attributes.
*   `table`: Defines a hash (table) of attributes for the `OpenStruct`.
*   `:message`, `:filename`:  These are just data.
*   `:write_to_file`:  This is where the "action" happens.  We create a `Proc` object.
*   `:call: !ruby/method:File.write`:  This specifies that the `call` method of the `Proc` should invoke `File.write`.
*   The arguments to `File.write` are then provided, again using an `OpenStruct` to hold the filename and message.

When this YAML is deserialized (unsafely), it will:

1.  Create an `OpenStruct`.
2.  Create another `OpenStruct` inside it.
3.  Create a `Proc` object that, when called, will execute `File.write`.
4.  Call the `Proc`, resulting in the file `/tmp/yaml_test.txt` being created (or overwritten) with the specified message.

**Important:** This is a *benign* example.  A real RCE payload would use a different gadget chain to execute shell commands instead of writing to a file.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

Several crucial mitigation strategies exist to prevent this vulnerability:

1.  **Use `YAML.safe_load` (or `Psych.safe_load`)**:  This is the *primary* and most effective mitigation.  `safe_load` restricts the types of objects that can be deserialized, preventing the instantiation of arbitrary classes.  It allows only basic types (strings, numbers, arrays, hashes) and a whitelist of explicitly permitted classes.

    ```ruby
    # Safe:
    data = YAML.safe_load(yaml_string, permitted_classes: [Symbol, Time, Date])

    # UNSAFE:
    # data = YAML.load(yaml_string)
    ```

2.  **Whitelist Allowed Classes:**  When using `safe_load`, carefully define the `permitted_classes` option.  Only include classes that are *absolutely necessary* for the application's functionality.  Avoid including potentially dangerous classes like `OpenStruct`, `ERB`, or any custom classes that might have exploitable methods.

3.  **Input Validation:**  Even with `safe_load`, validate the *structure* and *content* of the deserialized data.  For example, if you expect a hash with specific keys and value types, enforce those constraints.  This adds an extra layer of defense.

4.  **Consider Alternatives to YAML:**  If possible, consider using a safer serialization format like JSON.  JSON parsers are generally less prone to these types of deserialization vulnerabilities.

5.  **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep `delayed_job`, `psych`, and other related gems up to date.  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in newer versions.

6.  **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to YAML deserialization.

7.  **Least Privilege:**  Run the `delayed_job` worker process with the least privileges necessary.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

8.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as attempts to deserialize unusual objects or execute unexpected commands.

### 4.5. `delayed_job` Specific Considerations

*   **`Delayed::Job.yaml_attributes`:** Older versions of `delayed_job` had a `yaml_attributes` method that could be used to specify which attributes should be serialized using YAML.  This is now deprecated and should be avoided.
*   **Custom Handlers:** If you are using custom handler objects with `delayed_job`, be *extremely* careful about how they are serialized and deserialized.  Ensure that they are included in the `permitted_classes` whitelist (if using YAML) and that their methods cannot be abused.
*   **Database Storage:**  The way `delayed_job` stores job data in the database can influence the attack surface.  If the database itself is compromised (e.g., through SQL injection), the attacker might be able to directly inject malicious YAML into the job queue.

### 4.6. Conclusion

The crafting of malicious YAML payloads to exploit `delayed_job` is a serious threat that can lead to RCE.  The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of YAML data, allowing attackers to instantiate arbitrary objects and execute code.  By understanding the mechanics of this attack, implementing the recommended mitigation strategies (especially using `YAML.safe_load` with a strict whitelist), and maintaining good security practices, developers can effectively protect their applications from this critical vulnerability.  Regular updates, security audits, and a "defense-in-depth" approach are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
