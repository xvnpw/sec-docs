Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Bypass YAML Filters" attack path for applications using `delayed_job`.

## Deep Analysis: Bypass YAML Filters in `delayed_job`

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector represented by "Bypass YAML Filters" (1.1.2) within the context of a `delayed_job` implementation.  We aim to identify specific techniques attackers might use, assess the effectiveness of common mitigation strategies, and propose concrete recommendations to enhance the application's security posture against this threat.  The ultimate goal is to prevent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities arising from malicious YAML payloads.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   Applications using the `delayed_job` gem for background job processing.
*   Scenarios where user-supplied data, directly or indirectly, influences the YAML payload processed by `delayed_job`.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Job arguments passed to `delay` or `handle_asynchronously`.
    *   Data stored in the database that is later used as part of a job's payload.
    *   Configuration settings that might be influenced by user input.
*   YAML parsing vulnerabilities related to the `Psych` library (the default YAML parser in Ruby) and any custom YAML parsing logic implemented within the application.
*   Bypass techniques targeting any input validation, sanitization, or filtering mechanisms implemented to prevent malicious YAML payloads.
*   The analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities unrelated to YAML processing, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, unless they directly contribute to the ability to bypass YAML filters.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will begin by modeling the threat, identifying potential entry points for user-supplied data that could influence the YAML payload.  This involves reviewing the application's code and data flow.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known YAML parsing vulnerabilities, particularly those associated with `Psych` and common bypass techniques.  This includes reviewing CVEs, security advisories, blog posts, and exploit databases.
3.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Targeted):**  We will analyze hypothetical code snippets demonstrating common (and vulnerable) usage patterns of `delayed_job`.  If access to the application's codebase is available, we will conduct a targeted code review focusing on areas identified in the threat modeling phase.
4.  **Exploit Scenario Development:** We will develop concrete exploit scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker might bypass implemented filters to achieve RCE.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of common mitigation strategies, such as input validation, whitelisting, and using safer YAML parsing options.
6.  **Recommendation Generation:** Based on the findings, we will provide specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2: Bypass YAML Filters

**2.1 Threat Modeling:**

The core threat is that an attacker can inject a malicious YAML payload that, when deserialized by `delayed_job`, executes arbitrary code on the server.  The attack surface includes any point where user input can influence the data serialized into the `delayed_jobs` table.  Examples:

*   **Direct Argument Injection:**  A user-controlled parameter passed directly to a `delay` call:
    ```ruby
    # Vulnerable if params[:user_data] is not properly sanitized
    MyObject.delay.process_data(params[:user_data])
    ```
*   **Indirect Injection via Database:** User input stored in a database field that is later used in a delayed job:
    ```ruby
    # Vulnerable if user.profile_data is not sanitized before being used
    User.find(params[:id]).delay.update_profile(user.profile_data)
    ```
*   **Configuration Manipulation:**  If application configuration is stored in a way that can be influenced by user input (e.g., a database table), an attacker might be able to modify settings that affect how `delayed_job` processes jobs.

**2.2 Vulnerability Research:**

*   **Psych Vulnerabilities:**  `Psych`, especially older versions, has a history of vulnerabilities related to type confusion and object instantiation.  These vulnerabilities can be triggered by carefully crafted YAML payloads.  Examples include:
    *   **CVE-2013-0156:**  A critical vulnerability in Rails that allowed RCE via YAML deserialization.  While this specific CVE targeted Rails, the underlying principle applies to any use of `Psych` for deserializing untrusted YAML.
    *   **CVE-2014-2525:**  Another Rails vulnerability related to YAML deserialization.
    *   **General Type Confusion:**  YAML allows specifying the type of an object using tags (e.g., `!ruby/object:SomeClass`).  `Psych` can be tricked into instantiating arbitrary classes and calling methods on them, even if those classes are not intended to be deserialized.
*   **Bypass Techniques:**
    *   **Encoding Tricks:**  Using URL encoding, base64 encoding, or other encoding schemes to obfuscate malicious parts of the YAML payload, bypassing simple string-based filters.
    *   **Alternative YAML Syntax:**  Exploiting less common YAML syntax features, such as aliases and anchors, to construct payloads that evade filters that only check for specific keywords or patterns.
    *   **Filter Logic Flaws:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the filter's regular expressions or parsing logic.  For example, a filter that only checks for the presence of `!ruby/object` might be bypassed by using a different tag or by manipulating the whitespace around the tag.
    *   **Type Confusion with Custom Tags:**  If the application defines custom YAML tags, an attacker might be able to exploit vulnerabilities in how those tags are handled.
    *   **Psych::load vs Psych.safe_load:** Using `Psych::load` is inherently unsafe. Attackers will try to find any place where it is used.

**2.3 Code Review (Hypothetical & Targeted):**

**Hypothetical Vulnerable Code:**

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def process_profile_data(data)
    # ... some processing ...
    puts "Processing data: #{data}" # Example of where code execution could occur
  end
  handle_asynchronously :process_profile_data
end

# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def update
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    user.delay.process_profile_data(params[:profile_data]) # Vulnerable!
    redirect_to user_path(user)
  end
end
```

**Targeted Code Review (if codebase access is available):**

1.  **Search for `delay` and `handle_asynchronously`:**  Identify all uses of these methods to understand where jobs are being enqueued.
2.  **Trace Data Flow:**  For each identified job, trace the flow of data from user input to the job's arguments.  Pay close attention to any data that is stored in the database and later used in a job.
3.  **Examine Input Validation:**  Check for any input validation, sanitization, or filtering applied to user-supplied data before it is used in a job.  Look for weaknesses in these filters (e.g., overly permissive regular expressions, incomplete whitelists).
4.  **Check for `Psych::load`:** Explicitly search for any instances of `Psych::load` being used directly, as this is a major red flag.
5.  **Review Custom YAML Handling:** If the application defines any custom YAML tags or parsing logic, review this code carefully for potential vulnerabilities.

**2.4 Exploit Scenario Development:**

**Scenario 1: Direct Argument Injection (Bypassing a Simple Filter)**

Assume the application has a simple filter that attempts to block YAML tags:

```ruby
def sanitize_yaml(input)
  input.gsub(/!ruby\/\w+/, '') # Very weak filter!
end
```

An attacker could bypass this filter using:

*   **Whitespace Manipulation:** `! ruby/object:X` (adding a space)
*   **Alternative Tag:** `!somethingelse/object:X`
*   **Encoding:** URL-encode the tag: `%21ruby%2Fobject%3AX`

The attacker submits the following as `params[:profile_data]`:

```yaml
--- !ruby/object:OpenStruct
table:
  :foo: !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
gem_spec: !ruby/object:Gem::Specification
  name: xxx
  version: !ruby/object:Gem::Version
    version: 1.0.0
  dependencies:
  - !ruby/object:Gem::Dependency
    name: xxx
    requirements:
      requirements:
      - !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement::Bad
        requirements:
        - !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
          requirements:
          - "> 0"
          version: !ruby/object:Gem::Version
            version: '1.0.0'
            prerelease: true
            platform: !ruby/object:Gem::Platform
              cpu: x86_64
              os: linux
              version: 3.10.0
            rubygems_version: !ruby/object:Gem::Version
              version: '2.4.5'
            required_ruby_version: !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
              requirements:
              - "> 0"
              version: !ruby/object:Gem::Version
                version: '2.0.0'
            required_rubygems_version: !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
              requirements:
              - "> 0"
              version: !ruby/object:Gem::Version
                version: '2.0.0'
            extensions: []
            bindir: !ruby/object:ERB
              src: |
                <% `touch /tmp/pwned` %>
              encoding: !ruby/object:Encoding
                name: UTF-8
              filename: xxx
              safe_level:
              eoutvar: _erbout
              frozen_string_literal: false
```
This payload uses a known `Psych` deserialization gadget chain to execute `touch /tmp/pwned`.  The filter would likely fail to catch this.

**Scenario 2: Indirect Injection via Database**

If the `profile_data` is stored in the database *without* proper sanitization, the attacker can inject the malicious YAML payload *once*, and it will be executed every time the `update_profile` job runs.  This is even more dangerous because the attack is persistent.

**2.5 Mitigation Analysis:**

*   **Input Validation (Weak):**  Simple string-based filters are easily bypassed.  Regular expressions are difficult to make robust against all possible YAML variations.
*   **Whitelisting (Stronger):**  If the expected data structure is known, a whitelist approach is much more effective.  Instead of trying to block malicious patterns, define the *allowed* patterns and reject anything that doesn't match.  This is still complex for arbitrary YAML.
*   **`Psych.safe_load` (Strong, but limited):**  `Psych.safe_load` (or `YAML.safe_load`) disables the loading of arbitrary Ruby objects.  This prevents many common RCE exploits.  However, it *doesn't* prevent all potential issues, such as denial-of-service attacks using deeply nested YAML structures (the "Billion Laughs" attack).  It also requires careful configuration to allow specific classes if needed.
*   **`YAML.safe_load(..., permitted_classes: [ ... ], permitted_symbols: [ ... ], aliases: true/false)` (Strongest, most flexible):** This allows fine-grained control over what can be deserialized.  You can explicitly list the allowed classes and symbols, and control whether aliases are permitted.
*   **Avoid User-Influenced YAML:** The best approach is to avoid using user-supplied data directly in YAML payloads whenever possible.  If you must, serialize data into a safer format (e.g., JSON) *before* passing it to `delayed_job`.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the worker processes running `delayed_job` have the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep `delayed_job`, `psych`, and all other dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

**2.6 Recommendation Generation:**

1.  **Prioritize `YAML.safe_load`:**  Immediately replace all instances of `Psych::load` or `YAML.load` with `YAML.safe_load`.  Configure `permitted_classes` and `permitted_symbols` to the absolute minimum required for your application's functionality.  If no custom classes need to be deserialized, use `YAML.safe_load(yaml_string, permitted_classes: [], permitted_symbols: [], aliases: false)`.
2.  **Implement Strict Whitelisting (if feasible):** If the structure of the data being passed to `delayed_job` is well-defined and limited, implement a strict whitelist to validate the data *before* it is serialized into YAML.  This is the most robust defense against unexpected input.
3.  **Avoid Direct User Input in YAML:**  Refactor the application to avoid using user-supplied data directly in YAML payloads.  If possible, serialize data into a safer format (like JSON) before passing it to `delayed_job`.  If you *must* use user input, ensure it is thoroughly validated and sanitized *before* being incorporated into any YAML.
4.  **Least Privilege for Workers:**  Configure the `delayed_job` worker processes to run with the lowest possible privileges on the system.  This minimizes the impact of a successful RCE.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, focusing on areas where user input interacts with `delayed_job` and YAML processing.
6.  **Dependency Management:**  Keep `delayed_job`, `psych`, Ruby, Rails, and all other dependencies up-to-date.  Use a dependency management tool (like Bundler) and regularly check for security updates.
7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity related to `delayed_job`, such as failed jobs with unusual error messages or unexpected system calls.
8. **Consider alternative serialization:** If possible, consider using a different serialization format altogether, such as JSON, which is generally considered safer than YAML for untrusted input.

By implementing these recommendations, the application's resilience against YAML-based RCE attacks via `delayed_job` can be significantly improved. The combination of `YAML.safe_load` with strict whitelisting and a principle of least privilege provides a strong defense-in-depth strategy.
