### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.2 Bypass Marshal Filters

**2.1. Background: Marshal and Delayed Job**

`delayed_job` uses serialization to store job data (including arguments and the object to be invoked) in a database.  By default, it uses `Marshal.dump` for serialization and `Marshal.load` for deserialization.  Marshal is Ruby's built-in binary serialization format.  It's fast but inherently insecure when used with untrusted data because `Marshal.load` can instantiate arbitrary objects and call their methods, leading to RCE.

**2.2. Filter Implementations**

Applications using `delayed_job` might implement filters to mitigate the risks of `Marshal.load`.  Common approaches include:

*   **Whitelisting (Allowed Classes):**  This is the most secure approach.  The application maintains a list of explicitly allowed classes that can be deserialized.  Any attempt to deserialize an object of a class not on the whitelist is rejected.  This is often implemented using a custom `load` method that wraps `Marshal.load` and performs the check.

    ```ruby
    # Example (simplified)
    ALLOWED_CLASSES = [MyJobClass, AnotherAllowedClass].freeze

    def safe_marshal_load(data)
      begin
        obj = Marshal.load(data, proc { |o|
          raise SecurityError, "Disallowed class: #{o.class}" unless ALLOWED_CLASSES.include?(o.class)
        })
        return obj
      rescue SecurityError => e
        # Log the error, potentially raise an alert
        Rails.logger.error("Marshal deserialization error: #{e.message}")
        return nil # Or handle the error appropriately
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Blacklisting (Denied Classes):**  This approach is less secure and generally discouraged.  The application maintains a list of known dangerous classes (e.g., `OpenStruct`, `ERB::Compiler`).  This is a losing battle, as attackers can often find or create new dangerous classes.

*   **No Filters (Highly Vulnerable):**  If no filters are implemented, the application is extremely vulnerable to RCE.  Any attacker who can inject data into the `delayed_jobs` table can execute arbitrary code.

**2.3. Bypass Techniques**

Bypassing Marshal filters is significantly harder than bypassing YAML filters because Marshal is a binary format, and its internal structure is less well-documented.  However, several potential bypass techniques exist:

*   **Finding Gaps in Whitelists:**  The most common bypass is identifying a class that is *not* on the whitelist but can still be used to achieve RCE.  This requires a deep understanding of the application's codebase and the available classes.  For example, if a class with a vulnerable `after_initialize` or `method_missing` method is allowed, it might be exploitable.

*   **Object Reference Manipulation:**  Marshal data includes object references.  A sophisticated attacker might be able to manipulate these references to create unexpected object relationships or trigger unintended method calls.  This is extremely difficult and requires a deep understanding of Ruby's object model and the Marshal format.

*   **Exploiting Filter Implementation Bugs:**  The filter itself might contain vulnerabilities.  For example, a poorly written regular expression used for whitelisting might be bypassable.  Or, the filter might not correctly handle nested objects or complex data structures.

*   **Leveraging Allowed Classes:** Even with a strict whitelist, an attacker might be able to chain together calls to methods on allowed classes to achieve RCE. This requires careful analysis of the allowed classes and their interactions.  For example, if a class allows reading files, and another allows executing system commands, the attacker might be able to read a malicious script from a file and then execute it.

*   **Marshal Format Manipulation (Extremely Difficult):**  Directly manipulating the raw bytes of the Marshal data to inject malicious code or alter object structures is theoretically possible but extremely challenging.  This requires a very deep understanding of the Marshal format and is likely to be highly specific to the Ruby version and the specific objects being serialized.

**2.4. Impact of Successful Bypass**

A successful bypass of Marshal filters in `delayed_job` almost always leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.  The attacker can:

*   Execute arbitrary system commands.
*   Read, write, or delete files.
*   Access sensitive data (database credentials, API keys, etc.).
*   Install malware.
*   Take complete control of the application server.

**2.5. Detection and Prevention Strategies**

*   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization.  This is the most effective prevention strategy.  Regularly review and update the whitelist as the application evolves.

*   **Use a Safer Serialization Format:**  Consider using a safer serialization format like JSON, which is less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.  However, ensure that the JSON parser is also configured securely (e.g., disable `create_additions` in `ActiveSupport::JSON`).  If you need to serialize complex objects, consider using a more secure alternative like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack.

*   **Input Validation:**  While not a direct defense against Marshal bypass, validating all input to the application can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious data into the `delayed_jobs` table in the first place.

*   **Least Privilege:**  Run the `delayed_job` worker process with the least necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as:
    *   Failed deserialization attempts.
    *   Attempts to deserialize disallowed classes.
    *   Unusual system command execution.
    *   Unexpected network connections.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update `delayed_job` and other dependencies to the latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block some types of attacks, but it's not a reliable defense against sophisticated Marshal bypass techniques.

*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An IDS can monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns that might indicate an attack.

**2.6. Specific Considerations for Delayed Job**

*   **`handle_asynchronously`:**  When using `handle_asynchronously`, ensure that the methods being called asynchronously are carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Custom Job Classes:**  If you define custom job classes, ensure that they are designed securely and do not introduce any new vulnerabilities.

*   **Database Security:**  Protect the database used by `delayed_job` from unauthorized access.  An attacker who can directly modify the `delayed_jobs` table can easily inject malicious jobs.

### 3. Conclusion

Bypassing Marshal filters in `delayed_job` is a critical vulnerability that can lead to RCE.  While it requires significant expertise, the potential impact is severe.  The most effective mitigation strategy is to implement a strict whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization.  Using a safer serialization format like JSON is also highly recommended.  Regular security audits, monitoring, and keeping dependencies updated are crucial for maintaining a secure application.  Developers should prioritize these security measures to protect their applications from this dangerous attack vector.
