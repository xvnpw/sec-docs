# Attack Surface Analysis for collectiveidea/delayed_job

## Attack Surface: [1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/1__arbitrary_code_execution_via_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious objects into serialized job data, leading to code execution upon deserialization.
*   **`delayed_job` Contribution:** `delayed_job`'s serialization/deserialization mechanism (especially with YAML) is the core vulnerability. This is *the* defining attack vector of `delayed_job`.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a job's arguments in the database (or via an input vector that feeds into job creation) to include a YAML payload that, when deserialized by the worker, executes a system command.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise; attacker gains full control of the worker process and potentially the entire server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:** Switch to a safer serializer (JSON). This is the *most effective* mitigation and should be the default choice.
    *   **Secondary (if YAML is unavoidable):** Implement extremely strict input validation and whitelisting of allowed classes/methods *before* serialization. This is very difficult to do securely with YAML and is *not recommended* unless absolutely necessary due to legacy constraints.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with minimal privileges (limits the damage *after* a successful exploit).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit code that enqueues jobs, specifically looking for any potential injection points.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep `delayed_job` and related gems (especially the serializer) updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Job Overload](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_job_overload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the job queue with numerous or resource-intensive jobs, preventing legitimate jobs from being processed.
*   **`delayed_job` Contribution:** `delayed_job`'s core function is to queue and process jobs; this mechanism is directly targeted by this attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits thousands of jobs designed to consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth, overwhelming the worker processes.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability; legitimate users cannot access services that depend on background job processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the endpoints that *enqueue* jobs. This is the most direct mitigation.
    *   **Job Prioritization:** Use `delayed_job`'s priority system to ensure critical jobs are processed even under load.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure `delayed_job` to limit the number of worker processes and the resources each worker can consume.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring of the job queue length, worker process resource usage, and job execution times. Alert on anomalies.
    *   **Job Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for jobs. If a job exceeds its timeout, it should be terminated.

## Attack Surface: [3. Sensitive Data Exposure via Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/3__sensitive_data_exposure_via_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data passed as job arguments is exposed if logs, the database, or failed jobs are compromised.
*   **`delayed_job` Contribution:** `delayed_job` stores job arguments, including any sensitive data passed to them, directly in the database. This is a direct consequence of its design.
*   **Example:** A job is enqueued with an API key as a plain-text argument. If an attacker gains access to the database or logs, they can retrieve the key.
*   **Impact:** Data breach; exposure of sensitive user information, API keys, or other confidential data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Storage:** *Never* store sensitive data directly in job arguments. Pass identifiers (e.g., user IDs) and retrieve the sensitive data *within* the job itself, using secure methods. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Data Encryption:** If sensitive data *must* be passed, encrypt it before enqueuing the job and decrypt it within the job, using strong encryption and secure key management.
    *   **Database Access Control:** Restrict access to the `delayed_jobs` table (limits the blast radius of a database compromise).
    *   **Secure Logging:** Be extremely careful about logging job arguments. Redact or omit sensitive information from logs.
