## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This is the most critical area, as it provides a direct path to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious YAML -> HIGH RISK ->](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious_yaml_-_high_risk_-.md)

**Description:**  The attacker exploits the application's use of YAML for serializing job data. If the application deserializes untrusted YAML input without proper sanitization or restrictions, the attacker can inject a malicious payload.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Craft YAML Payload [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_craft_yaml_payload__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker constructs a YAML payload that, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code on the server. This often involves using known "gadget chains" â€“ sequences of object instantiations and method calls that ultimately lead to code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if YAML is used and unsanitized input is present) / Low (if proper mitigations are in place)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Low (many public exploits and tools available)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (understanding of YAML and basic exploitation techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected with proper logging and intrusion detection systems, but sophisticated attackers might try to obfuscate the payload)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Bypass YAML Filters [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_bypass_yaml_filters__critical_.md)

**Description:** If the application attempts to filter or sanitize YAML input, the attacker tries to circumvent these measures. This might involve using encoding tricks, alternative YAML syntax, or exploiting flaws in the filter's logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the strength of the filters)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires understanding of the specific filter implementation)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (requires deeper understanding of YAML parsing and filter evasion techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (bypassing filters often involves subtle techniques that are harder to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Inject Malicious Marshal Data -> HIGH RISK ->](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_inject_malicious_marshal_data_-_high_risk_-.md)

**Description:** Similar to YAML, the attacker exploits the use of Marshal for serialization. While generally considered safer, Marshal can still be vulnerable if the application deserializes data without restricting the allowed classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Craft Marshal Payload [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_craft_marshal_payload__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker creates a malicious Marshal payload designed to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization. This requires finding suitable "gadget chains" within the application's loaded classes.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (less common than YAML, but still possible if Marshal is used without restrictions) / Low (if proper class whitelisting is used)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding of Marshal serialization and finding suitable gadget chains)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (requires more specialized knowledge than YAML exploitation)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (similar to YAML, but potentially harder due to the less common nature of Marshal exploits)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Bypass Marshal Filters [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_bypass_marshal_filters__critical_.md)

**Description:** If the application implements any restrictions on Marshal deserialization (e.g., class whitelisting), the attacker attempts to bypass them. This is significantly harder than bypassing YAML filters.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the filter implementation and the use of whitelists)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** High (requires in-depth knowledge of Marshal and the specific filter)
*   **Skill Level:** Expert (requires significant expertise in Ruby internals and exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (successful bypass likely indicates a sophisticated attack)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Job Execution](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_job_execution.md)

These attacks require a pre-existing vulnerability (like SQL injection) to gain database access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Directly Insert Malicious Job Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_directly_insert_malicious_job_data__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the database (e.g., through SQL injection) and inserts a new row into the `delayed_jobs` table. This row contains a malicious `handler` (the serialized job data) designed to execute arbitrary code or perform other harmful actions when the job is processed.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires direct database access, typically through another vulnerability like SQL injection)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (depends on the malicious job's actions; could range from data modification to RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires exploiting a separate vulnerability to gain database access)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (depends on the method used to gain database access)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (database access logs and intrusion detection systems might detect unauthorized access)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Modify Existing Job Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_modify_existing_job_data__critical_.md)

**Description:**  Similar to 2.1.1, the attacker gains database access and modifies the `handler` column of an *existing* job in the `delayed_jobs` table.  This allows them to inject malicious code or alter the job's parameters to achieve their goals.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires direct database access)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (similar to 2.1.1)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires exploiting a separate vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (database audit logs might reveal changes)
