# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular HTTParty Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_httparty_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize Bundler and ensure `gem 'httparty'` is in your `Gemfile`.
    2.  Periodically check for updates using `bundle outdated httparty`.
    3.  Update `httparty` version in `Gemfile` to the latest stable release if a newer version is available.
    4.  Run `bundle update httparty` to install and update `Gemfile.lock`.
    5.  Commit changes to version control.
    6.  Incorporate updates into a regular maintenance schedule.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known HTTParty Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated `httparty` versions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known HTTParty Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in `httparty`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Bundler is used. Manual updates during major releases. Documented in `README.md`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning and more frequent updates are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS in HTTParty Requests](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_in_httparty_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using `HTTParty`, explicitly set `base_uri` to `https://` for API clients: `class MyClient include HTTParty; base_uri 'https://api.example.com' end`.
    2.  For individual `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post`, etc., ensure URLs start with `https://`.
    3.  Review code to confirm all `HTTParty` requests use HTTPS.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on HTTParty Traffic (High Severity):** HTTP traffic from `httparty` is vulnerable to interception.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on HTTParty Communication (High Severity):** Sensitive data sent/received by `httparty` over HTTP can be eavesdropped.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on HTTParty Traffic:** High risk reduction. HTTPS encrypts `httparty` traffic, mitigating MitM risks.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on HTTParty Communication:** High risk reduction. HTTPS protects data confidentiality in `httparty` communication.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTTPS generally used for external APIs via `HTTParty`. Documented in security guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated enforcement of HTTPS for all `HTTParty` requests. Manual code reviews are relied upon.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify SSL Certificates in HTTParty](./mitigation_strategies/verify_ssl_certificates_in_httparty.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure default SSL certificate verification in `httparty` is enabled (default behavior).
    2.  If customizing SSL, use `:ssl_ca_cert` or `:ssl_ca_path` options to specify trusted CA certificates.
    3.  Avoid disabling certificate verification (`verify: false`) in production `httparty` configurations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks via SSL Certificate Spoofing in HTTParty (High Severity):** Attackers can spoof SSL certificates if verification is disabled in `httparty`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks via SSL Certificate Spoofing in HTTParty:** High risk reduction. SSL certificate verification in `httparty` prevents certificate spoofing MitM attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default SSL verification enabled for `HTTParty`. Mentioned in "Secure Communication Configuration".
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated checks to ensure SSL verification is always enabled in `HTTParty` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set HTTParty Request Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/set_httparty_request_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure `timeout` and `open_timeout` options in `HTTParty` requests to prevent indefinite hangs.
    2.  Set timeouts based on expected response times of external services accessed via `httparty`.
    3.  Apply timeouts globally in `HTTParty` client classes or per-request. Example: `HTTParty.get('/resource', timeout: 10, open_timeout: 5)`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via HTTParty Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Slow external services can cause resource exhaustion if `httparty` requests hang indefinitely.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via HTTParty Resource Exhaustion:** Medium risk reduction. Timeouts in `httparty` prevent resource exhaustion from slow external services.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default timeouts set globally for `HTTParty` clients (e.g., 60 seconds). Documented in "Performance and Resilience Configuration".
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts are not finely tuned per API endpoint accessed via `httparty`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit HTTParty Redirects](./mitigation_strategies/limit_httparty_redirects.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Set `max_redirects` option in `HTTParty` requests to a reasonable limit (e.g., 5).
    2.  Use `follow_redirects: :safe` (recommended) or `:none` or `:all` in `HTTParty` based on security needs.
    3.  Avoid disabling redirect limits or setting very high `max_redirects` in `HTTParty`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities via HTTParty (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled redirects in `httparty` can be exploited for open redirect attacks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via HTTParty Redirect Loops (Low Severity):** Excessive redirects in `httparty`, including loops, can consume resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities via HTTParty:** Medium risk reduction. Limiting redirects in `httparty` reduces open redirect attack surface.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via HTTParty Redirect Loops:** Low risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion from redirect loops in `httparty`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `follow_redirects: :safe` is default for `HTTParty` clients. `max_redirects` uses `httparty` default. Mentioned in "Redirection Handling".
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `max_redirects` is not explicitly configured in `HTTParty` and relies on default. No dynamic redirect limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Construct HTTParty Requests with User Input](./mitigation_strategies/securely_construct_httparty_requests_with_user_input.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Sanitize and validate user input *before* using it in `HTTParty` request parameters (query, headers, body).
    2.  Encode user input properly when adding to query parameters in `HTTParty` requests.
    3.  Validate user-provided header values for safety before setting them in `HTTParty` requests.
    4.  Validate request body content before sending it via `HTTParty`, especially for structured data.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Header Injection Attacks via HTTParty (Medium Severity):** Unsanitized user input in `HTTParty` headers can lead to header injection.
    *   **Body Injection Attacks via HTTParty (Medium Severity):** Unsanitized user input in `HTTParty` request bodies can lead to body injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Header Injection Attacks via HTTParty:** Medium risk reduction. Input sanitization reduces header injection risks in `HTTParty` requests.
    *   **Body Injection Attacks via HTTParty:** Medium risk reduction. Input sanitization reduces body injection risks in `HTTParty` requests.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic sanitization for user input in `HTTParty` query parameters. Mentioned in "Input Validation".
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Header and request body sanitization/validation for `HTTParty` requests are not consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging of HTTParty Requests and Responses](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_of_httparty_requests_and_responses.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review logging related to `HTTParty` requests and responses.
    2.  Avoid logging sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data) from `HTTParty` requests/responses.
    3.  If logging sensitive data is needed, implement masking/redaction *before* logging `HTTParty` data.
    4.  Use appropriate logging levels in production to minimize verbose logging of `HTTParty` details.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information from HTTParty Logs (High Severity):** Logging sensitive data from `HTTParty` can lead to data disclosure.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose HTTParty Logging (Low to Medium Severity):** Verbose logging of `HTTParty` details can reveal internal information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information from HTTParty Logs:** High risk reduction. Avoiding or masking sensitive data in `HTTParty` logs reduces disclosure risk.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose HTTParty Logging:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Appropriate logging levels for `HTTParty` minimize information disclosure.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General guidelines discourage logging sensitive data. In "Secure Logging" guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated checks to prevent logging sensitive data from `HTTParty`. No systematic log redaction for `HTTParty` data.
