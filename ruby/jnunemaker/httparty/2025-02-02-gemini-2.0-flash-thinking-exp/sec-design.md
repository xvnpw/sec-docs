# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, HTTParty, is a Ruby gem that simplifies making HTTP requests. It acts as an HTTP client library for Ruby applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Simplify integration with external APIs and web services for Ruby developers.
- Increase developer productivity by providing a user-friendly and efficient HTTP client.
- Enable Ruby applications to consume and interact with data from various sources over the internet.
- Reduce development time and complexity associated with handling HTTP requests in Ruby.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in HTTParty could be exploited by attackers to compromise applications using the library.
- Unreliable or poorly performing HTTP requests due to issues in HTTParty could impact application functionality and user experience.
- Compatibility issues with different Ruby versions or other libraries could lead to integration problems and application instability.
- Misuse of HTTParty by developers, such as mishandling sensitive data in requests or responses, could lead to data breaches or compliance violations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS support - HTTParty supports making requests over HTTPS, ensuring encryption of data in transit. Implemented within the library's core functionality.
- security control: Dependency management - HTTParty relies on other Ruby gems. Security is partially dependent on the security of these dependencies. Described in `Gemfile.lock` and dependency update processes.
- security control: Input sanitization - HTTParty likely performs some level of input sanitization to prevent common injection attacks, although specific details would need to be reviewed in the code. Implemented within the library's request building and response parsing logic.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - HTTParty depends on other gems, which may contain vulnerabilities. Risk is accepted and mitigated by dependency updates.
- accepted risk: Misuse by developers - Developers using HTTParty might introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications by misusing the library or mishandling sensitive data. Risk is accepted as it is outside the scope of the library itself.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in HTTParty's dependencies.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze HTTParty's code for potential security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Use SCA tools to gain visibility into all components of HTTParty, including dependencies, and manage associated risks.
- security control: Secure coding guidelines for users - Provide clear documentation and examples for developers on how to use HTTParty securely, including best practices for handling sensitive data and authentication.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: HTTParty should support various authentication methods commonly used in HTTP requests, such as Basic Auth, Bearer tokens, API keys in headers or query parameters.
    - Requirement: Documentation should clearly explain how to securely implement different authentication methods with HTTParty, emphasizing secure storage and handling of credentials.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: HTTParty itself does not handle authorization, but it should facilitate the implementation of authorization in applications using it by correctly transmitting authorization tokens or credentials provided by the application.
    - Requirement: Examples and documentation should guide developers on how to integrate HTTParty with authorization mechanisms in their applications.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: HTTParty should perform necessary input validation to prevent common injection attacks, such as header injection or request smuggling.
    - Requirement: HTTParty should handle various content types and encodings securely, preventing vulnerabilities related to data parsing and processing.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: HTTParty must enforce HTTPS by default or strongly encourage its use for all sensitive communications.
    - Requirement: HTTParty should correctly handle TLS/SSL certificates and configurations to ensure secure connections.
    - Requirement: If HTTParty provides any functionality for data encryption or decryption beyond TLS/SSL, it must use well-established and secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- API Integrations: The primary business process enabled by HTTParty is the integration of Ruby applications with external APIs and web services. Disruption or compromise of these integrations can impact application functionality and business operations.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data sensitivity depends entirely on the APIs and web services that HTTParty is used to interact with.
    - Could range from public, non-sensitive data (e.g., weather data) to highly sensitive data (e.g., user PII, financial transactions, healthcare records).
    - The sensitivity level needs to be assessed based on the specific use cases of HTTParty within the Ruby applications.
    - If used for sensitive data, data in transit (requests and responses) and data handling within the application become critical security concerns.
