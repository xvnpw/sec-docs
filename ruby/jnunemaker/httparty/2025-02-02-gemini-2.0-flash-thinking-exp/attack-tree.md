## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via HTTParty Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_httparty_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the overall goal. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities related to HTTParty usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit HTTP Request Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_and___critical_node__exploit_http_request_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the HTTP requests made by the application using HTTParty. It's high-risk because successful manipulation can lead to various downstream vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] [CRITICAL NODE] Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or___critical_node__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker exploits an application vulnerability to control the URL used in an HTTParty request. This allows them to force the application to make requests to unintended destinations, such as internal resources or external malicious servers.
*   **Critical Nodes within SSRF Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Vulnerability allows URL Parameter Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: This is the entry point. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user input used to construct URLs for HTTParty, URL parameter injection becomes possible.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] HTTParty Makes Request to Malicious/Internal Resource [HIGH-RISK PATH]**:  This is the core of the SSRF attack. HTTParty, under the application's direction, makes a request to a resource the attacker controls or an internal resource they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Target Internal Network [HIGH-RISK PATH]**:  A common goal of SSRF is to access internal networks, bypassing external firewalls and security controls.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Access Internal Services/Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The ultimate impact of SSRF targeting internal networks is often to access sensitive internal services or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Request Body Manipulation (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or__request_body_manipulation__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If the application uses HTTParty to send data in request bodies (e.g., POST, PUT), an attacker might exploit an application vulnerability to inject malicious data into the request body. This malicious data is then sent to the target API.
*   **Critical Nodes within Request Body Manipulation Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Vulnerability allows Body Parameter Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: Similar to URL injection, this is the entry point. If user input is not properly sanitized before being included in the request body, injection is possible.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Data in Request Body [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The attacker successfully injects malicious data into the HTTP request body that HTTParty sends.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Target API (e.g., Injection in API) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The injected malicious data in the request body is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the *target API* that the application is communicating with. This could be SQL injection, command injection, or other API-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Exploit HTTP Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_and__exploit_http_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application handles HTTP responses received via HTTParty.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Deserialization (if using response parsing features) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or___critical_node__insecure_deserialization__if_using_response_parsing_features___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If HTTParty is configured to parse responses (e.g., JSON, XML) and the application then processes this deserialized data without proper security measures, insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can occur. This is primarily a vulnerability in the *application logic* that handles the parsed data, not directly in HTTParty itself.
*   **Critical Node within Insecure Deserialization Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerability in Deserialization Process (Application Logic) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The critical point is when the application code unsafely processes the deserialized data, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Information Disclosure via Verbose Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or__information_disclosure_via_verbose_errors__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If HTTParty or the application's error handling exposes detailed error messages that contain sensitive information (e.g., internal paths, configuration details), attackers can use this for reconnaissance.
*   **Critical Node within Information Disclosure Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Error Messages Contain Sensitive Information [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The critical point is when error messages inadvertently reveal sensitive details that aid an attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Client-Side Processing Vulnerabilities (if application processes response unsafely) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or__client-side_processing_vulnerabilities__if_application_processes_response_unsafely___high-risk__555739ba.md)

Attack Vector: If the application processes the response data from HTTParty and renders it in a web context without proper sanitization, client-side vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can occur.
*   **Critical Nodes within Client-Side Processing Vulnerabilities Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Processes Response Data Unsafely [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The critical point is when the application code fails to properly sanitize or encode response data before rendering it in a web page.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerabilities like XSS if response data is rendered in a web context [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The result of unsafe processing is often XSS, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Exploit HTTParty Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_and__exploit_httparty_configuration_weaknesses.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure configurations of HTTParty within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or__insecure_ssltls_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If the application configures HTTParty with weak SSL/TLS settings (e.g., disabling SSL verification), it becomes vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Critical Nodes within Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Man-in-the-Middle Attack [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The point where an attacker intercepts network traffic due to weak SSL/TLS configuration.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Intercept Sensitive Data in Transit [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The impact of a successful MitM attack is often the interception of sensitive data being transmitted.

## Attack Tree Path: [[OR] Stored Credentials in Configuration (less likely with HTTParty directly) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_or__stored_credentials_in_configuration__less_likely_with_httparty_directly___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If the application insecurely stores API keys or credentials used with HTTParty (e.g., hardcoded in code), these credentials can be leaked, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Nodes within Stored Credentials Path**:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Credential Leakage [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The point where credentials are exposed due to insecure storage.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Account Takeover/Unauthorized Access to External Services [HIGH-RISK PATH]**: The consequence of leaked credentials is often account takeover or unauthorized access to external services that the application interacts with via HTTParty.
