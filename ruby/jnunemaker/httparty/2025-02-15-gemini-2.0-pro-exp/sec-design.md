# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple and convenient way for Ruby developers to make HTTP requests.
*   Abstract away the complexities of dealing with different HTTP libraries and response formats.
*   Offer a user-friendly API that is easy to learn and use.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and reliability.
*   Ensure the library is well-documented and supported.
*   Foster a community around the library to encourage contributions and feedback.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited to compromise applications that use it.
*   Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to compatibility issues or bugs.
*   Poor performance could impact the performance of applications that rely on the library.
*   Lack of features or flexibility could limit the library's usefulness.
*   Competition from other HTTP client libraries could reduce adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The library uses standard Ruby libraries for handling HTTP requests (Net::HTTP), which are generally considered secure. (Described in the library's source code and documentation).
*   security control: The library provides options for configuring SSL/TLS settings, such as verifying certificates. (Described in the library's documentation).
*   security control: The library has a test suite that helps to ensure code quality and identify potential issues. (Described in the repository's test directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on external dependencies (e.g., Net::HTTP), which could have their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The library may not be fully compliant with all relevant security standards or best practices.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Integrate static analysis tools into the development process to detect potential security flaws early on.
*   security control: Provide clear guidance on secure usage of the library, including best practices for handling sensitive data and configuring security settings.
*   security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Consider adding support for more advanced security features, such as request signing or mutual TLS authentication.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library should support common authentication mechanisms, such as Basic Auth, Bearer Tokens, and API Keys.
    *   Sensitive credentials should never be hardcoded in the application code.
    *   The library should provide mechanisms for securely storing and retrieving credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   The library itself does not handle authorization, as it is an HTTP client. Authorization is the responsibility of the server the library is communicating with.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should properly encode and escape user-provided input to prevent injection attacks.
    *   The library should validate response data to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The library should use secure cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) for all communication.
    *   The library should verify SSL/TLS certificates by default.
    *   The library should provide options for configuring cryptographic settings, such as cipher suites and certificate authorities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Making HTTP requests to interact with remote services. This is the core functionality of the library and is essential for any application that uses it.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The library itself does not store any data. However, it is used to transmit data between applications and remote services. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application and the services it interacts with. Data transmitted could range from non-sensitive public information to highly sensitive personal or financial data. Therefore, the library must be used responsibly and with appropriate security measures in place to protect the data in transit.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that apply to applications using this library?
*   What are the expected performance requirements for applications using this library?
*   Are there any specific security concerns or threats that have been identified for this library or similar libraries?
*   What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and reliable HTTP client library for Ruby developers. Security is a high priority, but usability and ease of use are also important considerations.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The library relies on the security of the underlying Ruby standard libraries (Net::HTTP) and the remote services it interacts with. It is assumed that these components have their own security measures in place.
*   DESIGN: The library is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on common HTTP use cases. It is assumed that more complex or specialized requirements can be addressed through configuration options or by using other libraries in conjunction with HTTParty.
