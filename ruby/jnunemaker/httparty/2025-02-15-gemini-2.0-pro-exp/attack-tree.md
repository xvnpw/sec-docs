## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltrationmanipulation.md)

*   **1.1 Sniff Response (MITM) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If the application using `httparty` doesn't properly validate SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., uses `verify: false` or a misconfigured CA bundle), an attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. They can intercept and potentially modify the responses received by `httparty`.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires network access and misconfiguration, but misconfigurations are common.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Complete compromise of data confidentiality and integrity.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires setting up a MITM position, but tools are readily available.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires understanding of network protocols and MITM techniques.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with network monitoring and intrusion detection systems, but may be missed if not configured properly.)
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Enforce strict SSL/TLS certificate validation. Ensure `verify: true` (the default) is used.
        *   Use a correctly configured and regularly updated CA bundle.
        *   Consider certificate pinning for high-security scenarios.
        *   Code Review: Search for `verify: false` or insecure `ssl_context` configurations.
        *   Testing: Use tools like `mitmproxy` to test certificate validation.

*   **1.2 Manipulate Request (MITM) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 1.1, a MITM attacker can modify the *requests* sent by `httparty` if SSL/TLS is not properly enforced.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Same conditions as 1.1)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to unauthorized actions, data modification, or bypassing security controls.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Same as 1.1.

*   **1.3 Leak via Debugging/Logging [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** `httparty` can log request/response details. If sensitive information is included and logs are insecure, an attacker can gain access.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Very common misconfiguration.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the leaked data.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Requires access to log files.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of file systems.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Easy if logs are monitored, but often overlooked.)
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Review Logging Configuration: Avoid logging sensitive data. Use redaction.
        *   Secure Log Storage: Ensure logs are stored securely with access controls and encryption.
        *   Log Rotation and Retention: Implement rotation and a limited retention policy.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Code Execution/Injection](./attack_tree_paths/2__code_executioninjection.md)

*   **2.1 RCE via YAML Load [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If the application fetches data from an untrusted source and uses `YAML.load`, an attacker can inject malicious YAML for RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires untrusted source *and* `YAML.load`.)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Crafting a malicious YAML payload.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (YAML vulnerabilities and exploit development.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code analysis, intrusion detection, but obfuscation is possible.)
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Use `YAML.safe_load`: *Always* use `YAML.safe_load` with untrusted sources. Never `YAML.load`.
        *   Input Validation: Validate content type and structure before parsing.
        *   CSP: Restrict data sources.

*   **2.2 RCE via Unsafe XML Parsing (XXE) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 2.1, fetching XML from untrusted sources and using a vulnerable parser can lead to XXE attacks (file disclosure, SSRF, RCE).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Untrusted source *and* vulnerable parser.)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (File disclosure to system compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Crafting a malicious XML payload.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (XML vulnerabilities and exploit development.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code analysis, intrusion detection, WAFs, but obfuscation is possible.)
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Disable External Entities: Configure the XML parser to disable external entities and DTDs.
        *   Input Validation: Validate content type and structure before parsing.
        *   Use a Safe XML Parser: Choose a secure parser or configuration.

*   **2.3 SSRF via Follow Redirects [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** `httparty` follows redirects by default. An attacker controlling the initial URL can redirect to internal resources (SSRF).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires control of initial URL and a vulnerable internal service.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on accessible internal resources.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Finding a vulnerable endpoint and crafting a redirect URL.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding of SSRF and network reconnaissance.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network monitoring, intrusion detection, but can be hard to distinguish.)
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Limit Redirects: Use the `:limit` option.
        *   Whitelist Allowed Hosts: Reject redirects to unknown hosts.
        *   Validate Redirect URLs: Check against allowed patterns or a whitelist.
        *   Disable Redirects: Use `follow_redirects: false` if possible.
