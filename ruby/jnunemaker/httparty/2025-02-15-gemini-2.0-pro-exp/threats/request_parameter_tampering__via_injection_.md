# Deep Analysis: Request Parameter Tampering (via Injection) in HTTParty

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of Request Parameter Tampering attacks when using `httparty`.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors within `httparty`'s usage patterns.
*   Provide actionable, concrete recommendations and code examples to mitigate the threat effectively.
*   Educate the development team on best practices for secure `httparty` usage.
*   Go beyond basic mitigation and explore edge cases.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Request Parameter Tampering (via Injection)" threat as it relates to the `httparty` library in Ruby.  It covers:

*   All HTTP methods supported by `httparty` (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch`, `head`, `options`).
*   All request components that can be manipulated: URL parameters (`:query`), request body (`:body`), and headers (`:headers`).
*   Different data formats used in requests (e.g., JSON, XML, form-encoded data).
*   Interaction with various target API types (RESTful, SOAP, custom).
*   The analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Network-level attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle).
    *   Vulnerabilities in the target API itself (this analysis assumes the target API *could* be vulnerable if presented with malicious input).
    *   Client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) *unless* they directly relate to constructing `httparty` requests.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat model's description and impact, ensuring a shared understanding.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Examine `httparty`'s source code (and relevant documentation) to understand its parameter handling and encoding mechanisms.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:** Investigate known vulnerabilities and attack patterns related to HTTP request manipulation.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:** Create practical examples demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.  These PoCs will be *ethical* and designed to illustrate the risk, not to cause harm.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Develop and document specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples and library recommendations.
6.  **Edge Case Analysis:**  Consider less common scenarios and potential bypasses of standard mitigations.
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Present the findings in a clear, concise, and actionable format.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Threat Model Review (Recap)

As stated in the threat model, an attacker can manipulate user-supplied data to inject malicious values into `httparty` requests.  This can affect the URL parameters, headers, or body.  The impact ranges from minor data corruption to severe breaches, depending on the target API's vulnerabilities.  `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post`, and related methods are affected, particularly how `:query`, `:body`, and `:headers` are constructed.

### 2.2. HTTParty's Parameter Handling

`httparty` provides convenient ways to set request parameters:

*   **`:query`:**  Used for URL parameters.  `httparty` automatically encodes these values using `URI.encode_www_form`.  This is *helpful* but *not sufficient* for all cases.
*   **`:body`:**  Used for the request body.  `httparty` handles different formats (JSON, XML, form-encoded) based on the `Content-Type` header.  It automatically serializes Ruby objects into the appropriate format.
*   **`:headers`:**  Used to set custom HTTP headers.  `httparty` does *minimal* encoding of header values. This is a significant area of concern.

### 2.3. Vulnerability Examples and PoCs

Let's explore specific attack vectors and how they manifest with `httparty`:

**2.3.1. URL Parameter Injection (Query String)**

*   **Scenario:**  A target API expects an integer `id` parameter: `/api/users?id=123`.
*   **Vulnerable Code:**

    ```ruby
    user_input = params[:id] # Assume this comes from a web form
    response = HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com/users", query: { id: user_input })
    ```

*   **Attack:**  An attacker provides `id=123; DROP TABLE users;--`.  If the target API is vulnerable to SQL injection, this could delete the `users` table.  Even though `httparty` encodes the semicolon, the target API might still be vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**  Validate that `user_input` is an integer *before* passing it to `httparty`.

    ```ruby
    user_input = params[:id].to_i # Simplest validation, but may not be sufficient
    if user_input > 0 && user_input.to_s == params[:id] # More robust integer check
      response = HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com/users", query: { id: user_input })
    else
      # Handle invalid input (e.g., return an error)
    end
    ```

**2.3.2. Request Body Injection (JSON)**

*   **Scenario:**  A target API expects a JSON payload: `{"username": "john", "password": "password123"}`.
*   **Vulnerable Code:**

    ```ruby
    user_input = params[:user_data] # Assume this is a JSON string from the client
    response = HTTParty.post("https://api.example.com/login", body: user_input, headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' })
    ```

*   **Attack:**  An attacker provides a manipulated JSON string: `{"username": "john", "password": "password123", "isAdmin": true}`.  If the target API blindly trusts the `isAdmin` field, the attacker gains administrative privileges.
*   **Mitigation:**  Parse the JSON and *whitelist* allowed fields.  *Never* directly use the raw user-supplied JSON string.

    ```ruby
    begin
      user_data = JSON.parse(params[:user_data])
      safe_data = {
        username: user_data['username'], # Only allow specific fields
        password: user_data['password']
      }
      response = HTTParty.post("https://api.example.com/login", body: safe_data.to_json, headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' })
    rescue JSON::ParserError
      # Handle invalid JSON
    end
    ```
    Using a JSON schema validation library (e.g., `json-schema`) is highly recommended for complex JSON structures.

**2.3.3. Header Injection**

*   **Scenario:**  An application uses a custom header `X-User-ID` to identify the user.
*   **Vulnerable Code:**

    ```ruby
    user_id = params[:user_id]
    response = HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com/profile", headers: { 'X-User-ID' => user_id })
    ```

*   **Attack:**  An attacker provides `user_id=123\r\nX-Admin: true`.  The `\r\n` (carriage return and newline) injects a new header.  If the target API trusts the `X-Admin` header, the attacker gains admin access.  This is a classic *HTTP Header Injection* attack.
*   **Mitigation:**  Sanitize header values to remove or encode control characters.

    ```ruby
    user_id = params[:user_id].gsub(/[\r\n]/, '') # Remove CR and LF
    response = HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com/profile", headers: { 'X-User-ID' => user_id })
    ```
    A more robust approach is to use a dedicated library for header sanitization, as there might be other control characters to consider.

**2.3.4.  Bypassing `URI.encode_www_form` (Edge Case)**

`httparty` uses `URI.encode_www_form` for URL parameters.  While this encodes many characters, it doesn't encode *everything*.  For example, it doesn't encode single quotes (`'`).  If the target API uses single quotes for string delimiters in a SQL query, an attacker might still be able to inject SQL code.

*   **Attack:**  `id=1' OR '1'='1`.  `URI.encode_www_form` will *not* encode the single quotes.
*   **Mitigation:**  This reinforces the need for *input validation on the server-side* and *parameterized queries* in the target API.  On the `httparty` side, you *must* validate the input type (e.g., integer) and potentially use a more aggressive encoding scheme if you *know* the target API is vulnerable.  However, relying solely on client-side encoding is *not* a secure solution.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Comprehensive)

1.  **Input Validation (Strict):**
    *   Validate *all* user-supplied data against expected types, formats, lengths, and allowed values.
    *   Use a robust input validation library (e.g., `dry-validation`, `active_model-validations`).
    *   Define clear schemas for expected data structures (especially for JSON and XML).
    *   Reject any input that doesn't conform to the expected format.

2.  **Parameterization (Use HTTParty's Features):**
    *   Always use `httparty`'s `:query`, `:body`, and `:headers` options to set parameters.
    *   Avoid manual string concatenation when building requests.

3.  **Output Encoding (Context-Specific):**
    *   Understand the encoding requirements of the target API.
    *   If necessary, apply additional encoding *after* `httparty`'s automatic encoding, but *only* if you have a deep understanding of the target API's vulnerabilities.  This is generally *not* recommended as a primary defense.

4.  **Whitelisting (vs. Blacklisting):**
    *   Whenever possible, use whitelisting to allow only known-good values.
    *   Blacklisting (trying to block known-bad values) is often ineffective, as attackers can find new ways to bypass the filters.

5.  **Secure Header Handling:**
    *   Sanitize all header values to remove or encode control characters (especially `\r` and `\n`).
    *   Avoid using custom headers for sensitive information if possible.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep `httparty` and all related gems up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

8.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that the application only has the necessary permissions to access the target API.

9. **Defense in Depth:**
    * Do not rely on single security control. Implement multiple layers of security.

### 2.5.  Example using `dry-validation`

```ruby
require 'dry-validation'
require 'httparty'

class UserDataContract < Dry::Validation::Contract
  params do
    required(:username).filled(:string)
    required(:password).filled(:string, min_size?: 8)
  end
end

contract = UserDataContract.new

# ... inside your controller or service ...

result = contract.call(params[:user_data]) # Assuming params[:user_data] is a hash

if result.success?
  safe_data = result.to_h
  response = HTTParty.post("https://api.example.com/login", body: safe_data.to_json, headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' })
  # ... process response ...
else
  # Handle validation errors (result.errors.to_h)
  # ... return an error to the user ...
end
```

This example demonstrates using `dry-validation` to define a schema for the user data and validate the input before sending it to the API. This is a much more robust approach than manual validation.

## 3. Conclusion

Request Parameter Tampering is a serious threat when using `httparty`, even though the library provides some built-in encoding.  The key to mitigating this threat is *strict input validation* and *secure parameter handling*.  Developers must understand the potential attack vectors and implement robust defenses.  Using a validation library like `dry-validation` and following the comprehensive mitigation strategies outlined above will significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  Remember that security is a continuous process, and regular audits and updates are essential.
