# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Specify Parser](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_specify_parser.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all `HTTParty` calls:** Search the codebase for all instances where `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post`, etc., are used.
    2.  **Specify the `format` option:** For *each* `HTTParty` call, explicitly add the `:format` option, setting it to the expected data format (e.g., `:json`, `:xml`).  Do *not* rely on `httparty`'s automatic detection based on the `Content-Type` header. This forces `httparty` to use the specified parser, regardless of what the server sends.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Data Handling/Parsing Issues (XML/JSON):** (Severity: High) - Prevents `httparty` from automatically choosing a parser based on a potentially malicious `Content-Type` header, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Indirectly helps mitigate DoS by preventing `httparty` from attempting to parse a large response with an unexpected parser.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the risk of RCE by ensuring the correct parser is used, minimizing the attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Data Handling/Parsing Issues:** Risk significantly reduced. `httparty` will no longer guess the parser.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk slightly reduced; provides a small contribution to overall DoS protection.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Risk significantly reduced, as a potential attack vector is mitigated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/app/services/api_client.rb`: Implemented for JSON parsing.
    *   `/app/models/data_fetcher.rb`: Partially implemented; `format` is specified in some calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/app/models/data_fetcher.rb`: `format` is not consistently specified.
    *   `/app/controllers/external_data_controller.rb`: No parser specification; relies entirely on automatic parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict SSL/TLS Verification (Control via `httparty` Options)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_ssltls_verification__control_via__httparty__options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit for `:verify => false`:** Thoroughly search the entire codebase for any instances of `HTTParty` calls that include the `:verify => false` option.
    2.  **Remove or conditionalize (with extreme caution):**  Remove any occurrences of `:verify => false` found in production code. If it's *absolutely* necessary for development or testing (and this should be rare and well-justified), use environment variables to control its behavior, ensuring it defaults to `true` (or is omitted, as `true` is the default) in production.  The best practice is to *never* use `:verify => false`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: Critical) - Ensures that `httparty` verifies the SSL/TLS certificate of the server, preventing attackers from intercepting the connection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Risk eliminated (assuming the system's CA store is not compromised and `:verify => false` is never used in production).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/config/initializers/httparty.rb`: A global default is set to `:verify => true`, but this could be overridden locally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need a thorough code review to ensure no local overrides of the global `:verify => true` setting exist within individual `HTTParty` calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Redirection Following (Using `httparty` Options)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_redirection_following__using__httparty__options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess redirection needs:** Determine if following redirects is *essential* for each `HTTParty` call.
    2.  **Disable if unnecessary:** If redirects are not needed, use `:follow_redirects => false` within the `HTTParty` call to disable them completely.
    3.  **Limit redirects:** If redirects are required, use `:max_redirects` within the `HTTParty` call to set a low, reasonable limit (e.g., 3). This prevents infinite redirect loops and limits the potential for SSRF.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** (Severity: High) - Limiting redirects reduces the risk of `httparty` being tricked into accessing internal resources.  (Note: This is *not* a complete SSRF solution; URL validation is still crucial, but that's outside the scope of direct `httparty` interaction.)
    *   **Open Redirects:** (Severity: Medium) - Limiting redirects reduces the risk, but URL validation is still needed for complete protection.
    *   **Infinite Redirect Loops:** (Severity: Low) - `:max_redirects` directly prevents infinite loops.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Risk reduced, but not eliminated.  Further mitigation (URL validation) is required.
    *   **Open Redirects:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated. Further mitigation (URL validation) is required.
    *   **Infinite Redirect Loops:** Risk eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/app/services/link_checker.rb`: `:max_redirects` is set to 5.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/app/controllers/proxy_controller.rb`: This controller blindly follows redirects (no `max_redirects` or `follow_redirects` options are used), making it highly vulnerable.
    *   Not consistently applied across all `HTTParty` calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Timeouts (Using `httparty` Options)](./mitigation_strategies/set_timeouts__using__httparty__options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze response times:** Determine reasonable expected response times for each external API.
    2.  **Set `:timeout`:** For *every* `HTTParty` call, set the `:timeout` option to a value slightly above the expected response time (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds). This prevents `httparty` from waiting indefinitely.
    3. **Set granular timeouts:** Set `:read_timeout`, `:connect_timeout` and `:write_timeout` to a value slightly above the expected response time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents `httparty` from hanging indefinitely due to slow or unresponsive external services, which could lead to resource exhaustion in your application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced.  `httparty` will no longer wait indefinitely for responses.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/app/services/api_client.rb`: A global timeout of 10 seconds is set, but it's not applied to all individual `HTTParty` calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Many individual `HTTParty` calls do not have specific `:timeout`, `:read_timeout`, `:connect_timeout` or `:write_timeout` options set.
    *   Granular timeouts are not implemented.
