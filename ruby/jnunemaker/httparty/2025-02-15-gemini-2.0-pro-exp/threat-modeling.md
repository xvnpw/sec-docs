# Threat Model Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Threat: [SSL/TLS Certificate Validation Bypass](./threats/ssltls_certificate_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** SSL/TLS Certificate Validation Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting the HTTPS connection. They present a forged certificate. If `httparty` is misconfigured to ignore validation errors (e.g., `verify: false`), the application accepts the fake certificate, allowing the attacker to decrypt and modify traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity. Attacker can steal credentials, API keys, user data, and inject malicious data.
    *   **Affected HTTParty Component:** The `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post` (and other request methods), specifically the `:verify` option within the options hash. This directly controls `httparty`'s behavior regarding certificate verification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** disable SSL verification (`verify: false`) in production. Ensure `verify: true` (the default) is always used.
        *   Use code review and static analysis to detect `verify: false`.
        *   Educate developers on the importance of SSL/TLS validation.
        *   Consider certificate pinning (requires custom SSL context).

## Threat: [Request Parameter Tampering (via Injection)](./threats/request_parameter_tampering__via_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Request Parameter Tampering (via Injection)

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-supplied data used to construct `httparty` requests. Without proper sanitization/encoding, the attacker injects malicious values into URL parameters, headers, or the body. This alters the request's behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation on the *target* server. While `httparty` does *some* encoding, it's not a complete defense against injection.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the target API. Could range from minor data corruption to significant breaches or remote code execution on the *target* server.
    *   **Affected HTTParty Component:** `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post` (and others), specifically how `:query`, `:body`, and `:headers` are constructed. `httparty`'s automatic parameter serialization is a factor, as it can be misused if input isn't validated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data before using it in *any* part of an `httparty` request.
        *   Use `httparty`'s features for setting parameters (`:query`, `:body`, `:headers`) rather than manual string concatenation.
        *   Understand the expected data types/formats for the target API.
        *   Use a robust input validation library.

## Threat: [Unsafe Response Parsing](./threats/unsafe_response_parsing.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unsafe Response Parsing

    *   **Description:** `httparty` automatically parses responses (JSON, XML) based on `Content-Type` or the `format` option. An attacker crafts a malicious response to exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing library (e.g., a vulnerable JSON parser).
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure, depending on the parsing library vulnerability.
    *   **Affected HTTParty Component:** The response parsing logic within `httparty`, relying on external libraries like `MultiJson` (and its underlying parsers). The `format` option and automatic format detection are relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `MultiJson` and its underlying parsing libraries up-to-date.
        *   Explicitly specify the expected response format (e.g., `format: :json`).
        *   Validate the structure and content of the parsed response *after* `httparty` parses it. Don't assume safety. Use a schema validator if available.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage (in Requests)](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage__in_requests_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Sensitive Data Leakage (in Requests)

    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, tokens, etc.) is accidentally included in `httparty` requests, either hardcoded or inadvertently logged. This is a direct threat because `httparty` is the mechanism by which the data is transmitted.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected HTTParty Component:** Any `httparty` request method (`get`, `post`, etc.) where sensitive data might be in the URL, headers, or body.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** hardcode sensitive information.
        *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration system.
        *   Implement logging that *redacts* or *omits* sensitive data. Be careful with request bodies/headers.
        *   Use code review and static analysis.

## Threat: [Timeout Misconfiguration](./threats/timeout_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:**  Timeout Misconfiguration

    *   **Description:** `httparty` requests are made without appropriate timeouts, or with timeouts that are too high. A slow server can cause the application to hang, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs or becomes unresponsive (denial of service for the *application*).
    *   **Affected HTTParty Component:** The `timeout` option in `HTTParty.get`, `HTTParty.post` (and others). This is a direct configuration option within `httparty`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** set appropriate timeouts using the `:timeout` option.
        *   Choose reasonable timeouts for the expected response time.
        *   Consider separate timeouts for connection and overall request.
        *   Test under simulated network latency.
