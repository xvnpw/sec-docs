# Attack Surface Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/url_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL of an HTTP request by injecting malicious characters or URLs through unsanitized user input or application logic.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty is the mechanism used to make the HTTP request with the potentially malicious URL. If the URL passed to HTTParty's methods (e.g., `get`, `post`) is constructed from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        target_url = "https://api.example.com/data?id=#{params[:data_id]}" # params[:data_id] from user input
        HTTParty.get(target_url)
        ```
        An attacker could provide `../sensitive_data` as `params[:data_id]`, potentially accessing unintended resources if the API is vulnerable. Or they could inject a completely different malicious URL.
    *   **Impact:**  Making requests to unintended servers, potentially leaking internal data, performing actions on behalf of the application, or facilitating Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all user-provided input used to construct URLs. Use whitelisting of allowed characters or patterns.
        *   **URL Parameterization:**  Use HTTParty's features for parameterizing URLs instead of string interpolation when dealing with user input.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic URL Construction:** If possible, avoid constructing URLs dynamically based on user input. Use predefined URLs or a limited set of safe options.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers by manipulating header values through unsanitized user input.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty allows setting custom headers using the `headers:` option in its request methods. If these header values are derived from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        custom_header = params[:custom_header] # From user input
        HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com", headers: { "X-Custom" => custom_header })
        ```
        An attacker could inject values like `evil\r\nX-Malicious: true` to add extra headers.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via response headers, cache poisoning, session fixation, bypassing security controls on the receiving server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used to construct header values. Use whitelisting of allowed characters.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Header Construction:**  Minimize the use of dynamically generated headers based on user input.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  While less direct, ensure the receiving server properly handles and encodes headers to prevent exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** The application's HTTParty configuration does not enforce strong TLS/SSL settings, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic weaknesses.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty provides options to configure TLS/SSL settings, such as disabling certificate verification (`verify: false`), which weakens security.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        HTTParty.get("https://vulnerable-site.com", verify: false) # Disabling certificate verification
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, manipulation of communication, impersonation of the application or the remote server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Certificate Verification:** Ensure `verify: true` (or the default behavior) is used to verify the server's SSL certificate.
        *   **Enforce Strong TLS Versions:** Configure HTTParty to use only secure TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   **Verify Hostname:** Ensure hostname verification is enabled to prevent attacks where a valid certificate for a different domain is presented.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Request Parameters or Headers](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_request_parameters_or_headers.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) is unintentionally included in request parameters or headers when making requests using HTTParty.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty is the tool used to construct and send these requests. If developers mistakenly include sensitive data in the parameters or headers passed to HTTParty's methods, it becomes a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        api_key = ENV['SECRET_API_KEY']
        HTTParty.get("https://api.example.com", query: { api_key: api_key }) # API key in URL
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Including Secrets in URLs:**  Prefer using secure methods for passing credentials, such as dedicated authentication headers or request bodies.
        *   **Securely Manage Secrets:** Store and manage API keys and other secrets securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools).
        *   **Review Request Construction:** Carefully review how requests are constructed to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently included.
