## Deep Dive Analysis: CRLF Injection Leading to SSRF via HTTParty

This document provides a detailed analysis of the attack tree path: **Exploit Request Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Headers -> Inject CRLF Sequences in Headers -> Force Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [CRITICAL]**, specifically in the context of an application using the `httparty` Ruby gem.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path leverages a classic vulnerability known as **CRLF injection**. CRLF stands for Carriage Return (CR, `\r`, ASCII 13) and Line Feed (LF, `\n`, ASCII 10). These two characters are used to denote the end of a line in HTTP headers. By injecting these sequences into user-controlled input that is later used to construct HTTP requests, an attacker can effectively inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request.

The progression through the attack tree is as follows:

1. **Exploit Request Manipulation:** The attacker identifies an entry point where they can influence data that will be used to build an outgoing HTTP request. This could be through form inputs, URL parameters, or other user-provided data.

2. **Inject Malicious Headers:** The attacker crafts input containing CRLF sequences followed by the headers they want to inject.

3. **Inject CRLF Sequences in Headers:** The application, without proper sanitization, incorporates the attacker's input into an HTTP header. The CRLF sequences are interpreted by the HTTP client (in this case, HTTParty) as the end of the current header and the beginning of a new one.

4. **Force Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  By injecting a `Host` header, the attacker can control the destination server of the outgoing request. They can also inject other headers like `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, or custom headers, potentially manipulating the request further. This allows them to force the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, leading to SSRF.

**HTTParty's Role and Mechanism:**

`httparty` is a popular Ruby gem for making HTTP requests. It provides a convenient interface for defining request parameters, headers, and body. While `httparty` itself isn't inherently vulnerable, it acts as the vehicle to send the crafted request with the injected headers.

When an application using `httparty` constructs a request based on user input, and that input contains CRLF sequences, `httparty` will faithfully include these sequences in the raw HTTP request it sends. The underlying HTTP library used by `httparty` (typically `Net::HTTP` in standard Ruby) will interpret these CRLF sequences as header delimiters.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine the application has a feature where users can provide a target URL to fetch data from. The code might look something like this:

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class DataFetcher
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'some-internal-service'

  def fetch_data(target_url)
    self.class.get("/proxy?url=#{target_url}")
  end
end

fetcher = DataFetcher.new
user_provided_url = params[:target_url] # Assume this comes from user input

# Vulnerable code: Directly embedding user input in the URL
response = fetcher.fetch_data(user_provided_url)
puts response.body
```

An attacker could provide the following `target_url`:

```
example.com%0d%0aHost: attacker.com
```

Here, `%0d` represents `\r` and `%0a` represents `\n`.

The resulting HTTP request sent by `httparty` would look something like this (simplified):

```
GET /proxy?url=example.com\r\nHost: attacker.com HTTP/1.1
Host: some-internal-service
... other headers ...
```

The server receiving this request will interpret the injected `Host: attacker.com` header, effectively redirecting the request to the attacker's server.

**Potential Impact (Detailed):**

The "CRITICAL" designation for this node is justified due to the wide range of potential impacts:

* **Accessing Internal Services:** The attacker can bypass firewalls and network segmentation to access internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet. This could include databases, administration panels, or other sensitive applications.
* **Reading Sensitive Data from Internal Networks:** By targeting internal services, the attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data like configuration files, API keys, database credentials, or personal information.
* **Performing Port Scanning:** The attacker can use the vulnerable application as a proxy to scan internal network ranges and identify open ports and running services, gathering information for further attacks.
* **Interacting with External APIs on Behalf of the Application:** The attacker can force the application to make requests to external APIs, potentially consuming resources, modifying data, or performing actions that appear to originate from the legitimate application. This can lead to reputational damage or financial loss.
* **Bypassing Authentication and Authorization:** In some cases, internal services might rely on the originating IP address or specific headers for authentication. By controlling the request headers, the attacker might be able to bypass these security measures.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could force the application to make a large number of requests to a specific target, potentially causing a denial of service for that target or overloading the vulnerable application.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing CRLF injection is crucial. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** This is the most important defense.
    * **Strictly validate user input:**  Reject any input containing CRLF sequences (`\r\n`, `%0d%0a`, `\n`, `%0a`).
    * **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:**  While primarily relevant for database interactions, the principle of separating data from code applies here. Avoid directly embedding user input into header values.
    * **Encode special characters:** If CRLF sequences are absolutely necessary in a specific context (which is rare for headers), ensure they are properly encoded in a way that the HTTP client won't interpret them as header delimiters. However, it's generally best to avoid this altogether.

* **Secure Header Handling:**
    * **Use HTTParty's built-in header handling mechanisms:**  Instead of directly concatenating user input into header strings, use the `headers` option provided by `httparty`. This allows `httparty` to handle header encoding and formatting correctly.

    ```ruby
    require 'httparty'

    class DataFetcher
      include HTTParty
      base_uri 'some-internal-service'

      def fetch_data(target_host)
        options = { headers: { 'Host' => target_host } }
        self.class.get("/", options)
      end
    end

    fetcher = DataFetcher.new
    user_provided_host = params[:target_host] # Assume this comes from user input

    # Safer code: Using HTTParty's header option
    response = fetcher.fetch_data(user_provided_host)
    puts response.body
    ```

    * **Avoid manual header construction:**  Minimize or eliminate code that manually constructs HTTP header strings by concatenating user input.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct fix for CRLF injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate some of the potential impacts of SSRF by restricting the resources the application can load or connect to.

* **Network Segmentation:** Properly segmenting the network can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if SSRF is successfully exploited. Restricting access from the vulnerable application to internal services can reduce the attack surface.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly assess the application for vulnerabilities, including CRLF injection and SSRF, through code reviews and penetration testing.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable Code (as shown before):**

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class DataFetcher
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'some-internal-service'

  def fetch_data(target_url)
    self.class.get("/proxy?url=#{target_url}")
  end
end
```

**Safer Code (using HTTParty's header option):**

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class DataFetcher
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'some-internal-service'

  def fetch_data(target_host)
    options = { headers: { 'Host' => target_host } }
    self.class.get("/", options)
  end
end
```

**Even Safer Code (avoiding direct user input in headers if possible):**

If the target host is predetermined or can be selected from a predefined list, avoid using user input directly in the `Host` header altogether.

**Conclusion:**

The CRLF injection leading to SSRF is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences for the application and its environment. Understanding how `httparty` handles requests and implementing robust input validation and secure header handling practices are essential to prevent this type of attack. Prioritizing these mitigation strategies will significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect the application from potential harm.
