## Deep Analysis: CRLF Injection in HTTParty Applications

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Exploit Request Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Headers -> Inject CRLF Sequences in Headers" within the context of an application utilizing the HTTParty gem (https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty).

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This path describes a specific type of vulnerability stemming from insufficient handling of user-controlled input when constructing HTTP requests. The attacker aims to manipulate the headers of an HTTP request by injecting special characters known as CRLF sequences.

* **Exploit Request Manipulation:** This is the broad category, indicating that the attacker is trying to alter the intended structure or content of an HTTP request.
* **Inject Malicious Headers:** The attacker's specific goal is to introduce new or modify existing HTTP headers. This can be used for various malicious purposes.
* **Inject CRLF Sequences in Headers:** This is the *technique* used to inject the malicious headers. CRLF stands for Carriage Return (CR, `\r` or `%0d`) and Line Feed (LF, `\n` or `%0a`). These character pairs are crucial for delimiting headers and the body of an HTTP request.

**CRLF Injection Explained:**

HTTP relies on CRLF sequences to separate headers from each other and the headers from the body. When an application constructs HTTP requests by directly concatenating strings, especially when user-provided data is involved, an attacker can insert `%0d%0a` sequences into the input. This tricks the server into interpreting the attacker's input as the start of a new header or even the beginning of the request body.

**HTTParty's Role and Vulnerability:**

HTTParty is a popular Ruby gem that simplifies making HTTP requests. While HTTParty itself provides mechanisms for setting headers securely, the vulnerability arises in **how the application *uses* HTTParty**.

If the application constructs header values by directly concatenating strings, including user-controlled input without proper encoding or sanitization, it becomes susceptible to CRLF injection.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class MyApiClient
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'https://example.com'

  def make_request(user_input)
    headers = {
      'X-Custom-Header' => "User provided: #{user_input}"
    }
    self.class.get('/some/resource', headers: headers)
  end
end

# Vulnerable usage:
api_client = MyApiClient.new
user_provided_value = params[:user_input] # Imagine this comes from a web request

# If user_provided_value is "evil%0d%0aSet-Cookie: malicious=true"
api_client.make_request(user_provided_value)
```

In this example, if `params[:user_input]` contains a CRLF sequence followed by a new header, the server will interpret it as a legitimate header.

**Potential Impact:**

Successful CRLF injection can lead to several severe security vulnerabilities:

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** This is a primary concern. By injecting CRLF sequences, an attacker can control the subsequent parts of the HTTP request, including the request method, path, and even the body. This allows them to make requests to internal resources or external systems as if they originated from the vulnerable server.
    * **Example:** Injecting `"%0d%0aGET /internal/admin HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost: internal.example.com"` could force the server to make a GET request to an internal admin panel.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can inject `Set-Cookie` headers to set their own cookies in the user's browser. This allows them to hijack user sessions.
    * **Example:** Injecting `"%0d%0aSet-Cookie: sessionid=attacker_controlled_id"` could set a malicious session cookie in the user's browser.
* **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting headers that influence caching behavior (e.g., `Cache-Control`), attackers can manipulate how proxies and browsers cache responses. This can lead to serving malicious content to other users.
* **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** CRLF injection can sometimes be used to bypass authentication or authorization checks by injecting specific headers that the application or upstream systems rely on.
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers might be able to inject headers that reveal sensitive information about the server or application.

**HTTParty Specific Considerations:**

While HTTParty provides methods for setting headers as a hash (which is generally safer), the vulnerability arises when developers manually construct header values using string concatenation with user input.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent CRLF injection in applications using HTTParty, developers should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate user input:**  Define acceptable characters and formats for header values.
    * **Sanitize user input:** Remove or encode CRLF sequences (`\r`, `\n`, `%0d`, `%0a`) before incorporating them into header values.
    * **Use whitelisting over blacklisting:** Define what is allowed rather than trying to block all potentially malicious inputs.
* **Secure Header Construction:**
    * **Utilize HTTParty's built-in header handling:**  Pass headers as a hash to HTTParty's `get`, `post`, etc., methods. This allows HTTParty to handle encoding and prevent injection.
    * **Avoid direct string concatenation for header values involving user input.**
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for CRLF injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of some attacks that might leverage it, such as script injection.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including CRLF injection points.
* **Keep HTTParty Up-to-Date:** Ensure you are using the latest version of HTTParty to benefit from any security patches or improvements.
* **Framework-Level Protections:** If using a web framework like Rails, leverage its built-in mechanisms for handling HTTP requests and responses, which often include protections against common vulnerabilities.

**Code Example (Mitigated):**

```ruby
require 'httparty'
require 'cgi' # For escaping

class MyApiClient
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'https://example.com'

  def make_request(user_input)
    # Option 1: Using HTTParty's hash-based header handling
    headers = {
      'X-Custom-Header' => "User provided: #{CGI.escape_html(user_input)}" # Escape for HTML context, if relevant
    }
    self.class.get('/some/resource', headers: headers)

    # Option 2: Encoding CRLF sequences
    safe_user_input = user_input.gsub(/[\r\n]/, '') # Remove CRLF
    # OR
    safe_user_input = CGI.escape(user_input) # URL encode

    headers_safe = {
      'X-Custom-Header' => "User provided: #{safe_user_input}"
    }
    self.class.get('/some/resource', headers: headers_safe)
  end
end

# Secure usage:
api_client = MyApiClient.new
user_provided_value = params[:user_input]

api_client.make_request(user_provided_value)
```

**Conclusion:**

CRLF injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant security implications in applications using HTTParty. The key to preventing this attack lies in carefully handling user input and ensuring that HTTP headers are constructed securely. By avoiding direct string concatenation of user-controlled data into header values and utilizing HTTParty's built-in features for header management, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. Regular security assessments and adherence to secure coding practices are crucial for maintaining the security of applications that interact with external systems.
