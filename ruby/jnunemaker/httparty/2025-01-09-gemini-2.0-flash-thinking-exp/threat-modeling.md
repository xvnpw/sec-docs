# Threat Model Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Threat: [Malicious URL Construction Leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/malicious_url_construction_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application by providing malicious input that gets incorporated into the URL used in an HTTParty request. The application, using HTTParty, would then execute a request to an attacker-controlled or internal resource. This directly involves HTTParty's request execution functionality.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data exfiltration from internal networks, denial of service against internal or external systems, or exploitation of vulnerabilities on other systems reachable by the server.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** Request methods (e.g., `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `request`) where the `uri` or `path` is constructed dynamically and passed to HTTParty.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used to construct URLs passed to HTTParty.
*   Use allow-lists of permitted hosts or URL patterns if the target destinations are predictable.
*   Avoid directly embedding user-provided data into URLs. If necessary, use URL encoding and ensure proper escaping.
*   Consider using a dedicated URL building library to enforce structure and prevent injection before passing it to HTTParty.

## Threat: [HTTP Method Tampering](./threats/http_method_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to influence the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used in an HTTParty request, even if the application intended a different method. This occurs when the application uses a dynamically determined method passed to HTTParty's request methods.

**Impact:** Data modification or deletion on the remote server, bypassing intended access controls, or triggering unintended server-side operations due to HTTParty sending the manipulated method.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** Request methods (e.g., `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `request`) where the `method` is determined dynamically and passed to HTTParty.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Explicitly define and control the HTTP method used for each HTTParty request within the application logic before calling HTTParty.
*   Avoid relying on user input or external data to determine the HTTP method unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly validated against an allow-list of acceptable methods before being used with HTTParty.
*   Implement server-side checks to verify the expected HTTP method for specific actions.

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers into an HTTParty request if the application allows user input to be directly included in the headers passed to HTTParty without proper sanitization. HTTParty will then send these crafted headers.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls on the remote server, HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities on the remote server (if the injected headers influence the response), cache poisoning, or exfiltration of sensitive information through custom headers sent by HTTParty.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** Header options (e.g., the `headers` parameter in request methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid directly incorporating user input into HTTP headers passed to HTTParty.
*   If user input must be included in headers, implement strict validation to disallow newline characters and other control characters before setting the headers in HTTParty.
*   Use HTTParty's built-in mechanisms for setting specific, known headers rather than allowing arbitrary header construction from user input.

## Threat: [Body Manipulation in Requests](./threats/body_manipulation_in_requests.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the request body of an HTTParty request if the application constructs the body based on user input without proper encoding or sanitization, and then passes this body to HTTParty.

**Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the remote server's data processing logic, such as SQL injection (if the remote server processes the body as SQL), command injection, or other data manipulation vulnerabilities due to HTTParty sending the malicious body.

**Affected HTTParty Component:**  Options for setting the request body (e.g., `body`, `query` for GET requests, `params` for form data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Properly encode and sanitize all user-provided data before including it in the request body that is passed to HTTParty.
*   Use parameterized requests or prepared statements on the remote server if applicable to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
*   Validate the structure and content of the request body before sending it using HTTParty.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on HTTParty to automatically parse response data (e.g., JSON or XML) and then directly uses the resulting objects without proper validation, a compromised or malicious remote server could send back specially crafted data that, when deserialized by HTTParty, leads to arbitrary code execution or other malicious outcomes on the application server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, denial of service, or data corruption.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** Response parsing/handling (automatic parsing based on `Content-Type`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data received from external services after it has been parsed by HTTParty.
*   Be cautious when automatically deserializing data from untrusted sources. Consider explicitly parsing and validating the structure and content of the response after HTTParty receives it.
*   If possible, avoid automatic deserialization and handle the raw response data, parsing it securely within the application.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration (TLS/SSL Verification)](./threats/insecure_default_configuration__tlsssl_verification_.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently disable SSL certificate verification in HTTParty or not configure it correctly using HTTParty's options, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks when making requests through HTTParty.

**Impact:** An attacker could intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the remote server, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** TLS/SSL configuration options (e.g., `ssl_ca_file`, `ssl_ca_path`, `verify`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure SSL certificate verification is enabled by default in HTTParty and not explicitly disabled without a strong, well-understood reason.
*   Use a trusted CA bundle for certificate verification when configuring HTTParty.
*   Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections to known servers within HTTParty's configuration.
