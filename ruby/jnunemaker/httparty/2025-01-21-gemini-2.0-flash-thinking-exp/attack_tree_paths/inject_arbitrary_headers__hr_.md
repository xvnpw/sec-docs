### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Arbitrary Headers [HR]

**Attack Vector: Injecting arbitrary and potentially malicious headers into HTTP requests.**

This attack vector exploits the ability to control or influence the headers sent in an HTTP request. Attackers can leverage this to inject headers that can manipulate server-side behavior, bypass security controls, or compromise user sessions. The core issue lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of data used to construct HTTP headers.

**HTTParty Involvement: HTTParty allows setting custom headers.**

HTTParty provides a straightforward mechanism for setting custom headers when making HTTP requests. This is a necessary and useful feature for many legitimate use cases, such as setting API keys, content types, or custom authentication tokens. However, this flexibility also presents a potential security risk if the values for these headers are derived from untrusted sources, such as user input or external data.

Consider the following example using HTTParty:

```ruby
require 'httparty'

user_provided_header = params[:custom_header] # Imagine this comes from a web form

response = HTTParty.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers: { 'X-Custom-Header' => user_provided_header })
```

In this scenario, if `params[:custom_header]` is not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious headers.

**Impact: Can lead to various issues like bypassing authentication, session hijacking, or triggering server-side vulnerabilities.**

The impact of successful header injection can be significant:

* **Bypassing Authentication:** Attackers might inject headers like `X-Authenticated-User` or similar custom authentication headers that the backend application trusts without proper verification. This could grant unauthorized access to resources.

    * **Example:**  An attacker might set `X-Admin: true` if the application naively checks for this header to grant administrative privileges.

* **Session Hijacking:** Injecting a `Cookie` header with a known session ID can allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.

    * **Example:**  An attacker could steal a user's session cookie and then use HTTParty to make requests with that cookie injected into the `Cookie` header.

* **Triggering Server-Side Vulnerabilities:** Certain headers can trigger vulnerabilities on the server-side.

    * **Example:** Injecting a malicious `Host` header could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the backend application uses the `Host` header to construct URLs for internal requests without proper validation.
    * **Example:** Manipulating caching headers like `Cache-Control` or `Pragma` could lead to cache poisoning, where the attacker can serve malicious content to other users.

* **Information Disclosure:**  Injecting headers that influence the server's response format or content encoding could lead to unintended information disclosure.

    * **Example:**  Injecting `Accept-Encoding: gzip` when the server might not be expecting it could reveal compressed data that is not properly handled by the application.

**Mitigation: Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided input used in headers. Implement strict header allow-lists.**

To mitigate the risk of header injection, the following strategies are crucial:

* **Thorough Input Sanitization:**  Any data originating from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs, databases) that is used to construct HTTP headers **must** be rigorously sanitized. This involves:
    * **Encoding:** Encoding special characters that could be interpreted as header delimiters or control characters.
    * **Validation:**  Verifying that the input conforms to the expected format and character set for the specific header.
    * **Escaping:**  Escaping characters that have special meaning in HTTP headers.

    **Example (Ruby):**

    ```ruby
    require 'cgi'

    user_provided_value = params[:some_input]
    sanitized_value = CGI.escape_html(user_provided_value) # For display, not header injection

    # For headers, more stringent checks are needed
    allowed_chars = /^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_.]+$/ # Example: Allow only alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore, dot
    if user_provided_value =~ allowed_chars
      headers = { 'X-Custom-Data' => user_provided_value }
    else
      # Log the attempt and potentially reject the request
      Rails.logger.warn "Potential header injection attempt: #{user_provided_value}"
      # Handle the error appropriately
    end
    ```

* **Implement Strict Header Allow-lists:** Instead of trying to block potentially malicious characters, define a strict list of allowed headers and their expected values or formats. This approach significantly reduces the attack surface.

    * **Example:** If your application only needs to set `Content-Type` and `Authorization` headers, explicitly define these and reject any attempts to set other headers dynamically based on user input.

    ```ruby
    allowed_headers = {
      'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
      'Authorization' => "Bearer #{api_token}"
    }

    user_provided_headers = params[:headers] || {} # Assuming a structure like { 'X-Custom': 'value' }

    final_headers = allowed_headers.dup # Start with allowed headers

    # Only add user-provided headers if they are explicitly allowed and validated
    if user_provided_headers['X-Correlation-ID']
      # Validate the format of X-Correlation-ID
      if user_provided_headers['X-Correlation-ID'] =~ /^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-4[a-f0-9]{3}-[89ab][a-f0-9]{3}-[a-f0-9]{12}$/i
        final_headers['X-Correlation-ID'] = user_provided_headers['X-Correlation-ID']
      else
        Rails.logger.warn "Invalid X-Correlation-ID format: #{user_provided_headers['X-Correlation-ID']}"
      end
    end

    response = HTTParty.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers: final_headers)
    ```

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow the setting of headers that are absolutely necessary for the functionality. Avoid exposing the ability to set arbitrary headers directly based on user input.

* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the codebase to identify potential areas where user input is used to construct HTTP headers. Conduct security audits to proactively find and address vulnerabilities.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF that can inspect HTTP traffic and block requests with suspicious or malicious headers.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection in outgoing requests, CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of attacks that might be facilitated by header injection (e.g., by limiting the sources from which scripts can be loaded).

**Specific Considerations for HTTParty:**

* **Careful Use of the `headers:` Option:**  Be extremely cautious when using the `headers:` option in HTTParty, especially when the values are derived from external sources.
* **Centralized Header Management:** Consider creating a centralized function or module to manage the construction of HTTP headers, allowing for consistent sanitization and validation logic.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging to track the headers being sent in HTTP requests. Monitor for unusual or unexpected header values that could indicate an attack.

**Conclusion:**

The ability to inject arbitrary headers poses a significant security risk in applications using HTTParty. While HTTParty provides the necessary functionality to set custom headers, developers must exercise extreme caution and implement robust input sanitization and header allow-listing strategies. By understanding the potential impacts and adopting secure coding practices, development teams can effectively mitigate this attack vector and protect their applications from exploitation.
