# Threat Model Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input Leading to Request Parameter Injection](./threats/unsanitized_input_leading_to_request_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the data sent in HTTP requests by injecting malicious code or unexpected values into request parameters (query strings or request bodies). This happens when user-provided input is directly incorporated into the request *using HTTParty's `params` option* without proper sanitization or validation. The attacker might craft URLs or request bodies to target specific endpoints or exploit vulnerabilities in the remote service.

**Impact:**  The attacker could potentially bypass authentication or authorization checks on the remote server, trigger unintended actions on the remote system (e.g., data modification or deletion), or even exploit vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution on the target server.

**Affected HTTParty Component:** The `params` option when making requests (e.g., `HTTParty.get(url, params: { user_input: params[:user] })`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in request parameters.
*   Use parameterized requests or properly escape data before including it in request parameters.
*   Avoid directly concatenating user input into request parameters.
*   Prefer using `httparty`'s built-in mechanisms for constructing request parameters.

## Threat: [Header Injection Vulnerability](./threats/header_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests made by the application. This occurs when user-controlled data is used to set HTTP headers *using HTTParty's `headers` option* without proper validation or sanitization. The attacker might inject headers to bypass security measures, manipulate caching behavior, or exploit vulnerabilities in intermediary proxies or the target server. For example, injecting a `Host` header could be used in SSRF attacks.

**Impact:**  This could lead to various security issues, including unauthorized access, information disclosure, or even the ability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Affected HTTParty Component:**  The `headers` option when making requests (e.g., `HTTParty.get(url, headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': params[:user_header] })`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly setting headers with user-provided data.
*   If setting headers with user input is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input to prevent injection of unexpected characters or control sequences.
*   Use `httparty`'s built-in mechanisms for setting standard headers where possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `httparty` to fetch data in formats like JSON or XML and deserializes it without proper validation, a malicious attacker controlling the remote server could send crafted response data containing malicious code. When this data is deserialized *by the application after being fetched by HTTParty*, it could lead to remote code execution.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the application's server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other severe consequences.

**Affected HTTParty Component:**  The response parsing mechanisms, particularly when using formats like JSON or XML, and the underlying libraries used for deserialization (e.g., `MultiJson`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate the structure and content of the response data before deserialization.
*   Consider using safer data formats or libraries that offer better protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   Be aware of the specific deserialization libraries used by `httparty` and their potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement input validation on the deserialized data before using it in the application logic.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the application doesn't properly configure TLS/SSL settings *within HTTParty*, it could be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This includes disabling certificate verification, using outdated TLS protocols, or not enforcing HTTPS. An attacker could intercept communication between the application and the remote server, potentially stealing sensitive information or manipulating data in transit.

**Impact:**  Confidential data transmitted between the application and the external service could be exposed to the attacker. The attacker might also be able to modify the data being exchanged.

**Affected HTTParty Component:**  The SSL/TLS configuration options provided by `httparty`, such as `verify`, `ssl_version`, and the use of HTTPS in the request URL.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable certificate verification (`verify: true`).
*   Explicitly set the desired TLS version to a secure and up-to-date version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   Ensure that the application defaults to HTTPS for sensitive communications.
*   Avoid disabling certificate verification in production environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in HTTParty or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_httparty_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `httparty` and its dependencies might have security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, attackers could potentially compromise the application *through the HTTParty library*.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected HTTParty Component:**  The entire `httparty` gem and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `httparty` and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address potential risks.
*   Monitor security advisories for `httparty` and its dependencies.
