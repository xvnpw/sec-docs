# Attack Surface Analysis for jnunemaker/httparty

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized URL Input leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_url_input_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL used by HTTParty to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty directly uses the provided URL string in its request methods (e.g., `HTTParty.get(user_provided_url)`). If this URL is derived from user input or external data without sanitization, it becomes a vector for SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a website URL from a user and uses HTTParty to fetch its content: `HTTParty.get(params[:website_url])`. An attacker could provide `http://localhost:6379/` to interact with a local Redis instance.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, data exfiltration from internal networks, port scanning, denial of service against internal or external targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all URL inputs before passing them to HTTParty methods.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.
        *   Consider using a URL parsing library to validate the structure and components of the URL.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection via the `headers` Option](./attack_surfaces/header_injection_via_the__headers__option.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers by manipulating the values passed to the `headers` option in HTTParty requests.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty allows setting custom headers through the `headers` option, directly incorporating the provided values into the outgoing request.
    *   **Example:** An application sets a custom `User-Agent` header based on user input: `HTTParty.get('https://example.com', headers: {'User-Agent': params[:user_agent]})`. An attacker could inject malicious values like `X-Forwarded-For: malicious_ip\r\nEvil-Header: attack`.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (if headers are reflected), cache poisoning, session fixation, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all header values before setting them in HTTParty requests.
        *   Avoid directly using user input for header values.
        *   Use predefined, safe header values where possible.
        *   Implement proper output encoding on the receiving end if headers are reflected.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Bodies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_response_bodies.md)

*   **Description:** If HTTParty is configured to automatically parse response bodies (based on `Content-Type`) and the application trusts this parsing without validation, attackers can send malicious serialized data to achieve remote code execution.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty can automatically parse responses based on the `Content-Type` header, potentially using insecure deserialization methods for formats like YAML or Marshal in Ruby.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches data expecting JSON but the attacker controls the remote server and sends a response with `Content-Type: application/x-yaml` containing malicious YAML payload that executes code upon parsing.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly specify the expected response format and handle parsing manually.
        *   Avoid relying solely on the `Content-Type` header for determining the parsing method.
        *   If automatic parsing is necessary, ensure the application is prepared to handle potential errors and unexpected data structures.
        *   Consider using safer data formats like JSON where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

*   **Description:** HTTParty, by default, follows HTTP redirects. If the initial request is made to a URL controlled by an attacker, they can redirect the request to an internal resource or another external service.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty's default behavior of following redirects can be exploited if the initial target URL is not trusted.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches a resource from a user-provided URL. The attacker provides a URL that redirects to an internal service like `http://localhost:22/` (SSH port).
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, port scanning, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully validate the initial target URL.
        *   Consider disabling automatic redirects if the application logic doesn't require them or if the target URLs are not fully trusted. HTTParty provides options to control redirect behavior (e.g., `:follow_redirects => false`).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** HTTParty provides options to configure TLS/SSL settings, such as disabling certificate verification or allowing insecure protocols. If these options are used inappropriately, the application becomes vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How HTTParty Contributes:** HTTParty allows developers to customize TLS/SSL settings, and incorrect configuration can weaken security.
    *   **Example:** An application sets `:verify => false` in the HTTParty options to bypass certificate verification, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, credential theft, compromise of communication integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always verify SSL certificates unless there is a very specific and well-understood reason not to.
        *   Use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols.
        *   Avoid disabling SSL verification in production environments. Ensure the `verify: true` option is used.
