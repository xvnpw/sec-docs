## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependency.md)

This path represents the overall danger of incorporating untrusted code into the application through Cocoapods. Attackers can leverage various techniques to inject malicious dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Pod](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_pod.md)

This path focuses on the risk of a trusted dependency becoming compromised or a new malicious dependency being introduced. Attackers aim to inject malicious code through existing or newly created pods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create and Promote a Malicious Pod](./attack_tree_paths/create_and_promote_a_malicious_pod.md)

This path highlights the techniques attackers use to trick developers into using their malicious pods, either through naming similarities or by exploiting dependency resolution mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Typosquatting Attack](./attack_tree_paths/typosquatting_attack.md)

Attackers create pods with names that are very similar to popular legitimate pods, hoping developers will make typos when adding dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

Attackers create public pods with the same name as internal, private dependencies, causing Cocoapods to potentially install the malicious public pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Pod's Repository/Account](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_pod's_repositoryaccount.md)

This path focuses on the risk of attackers gaining control over the resources of a legitimate pod, allowing them to modify its code or metadata.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Maintainer Account](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_maintainer_account.md)

Attackers target the accounts of pod maintainers on the Cocoapods trunk to directly push compromised versions of pods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Post-Install Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_post-install_scripts.md)

This path highlights the danger of malicious code being embedded within a pod's post-install script, which executes with elevated privileges during the `pod install` process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code into a compromised version of the pod](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_a_compromised_version_of_the_pod.md)

The core action in a supply chain attack where malicious code is inserted into an otherwise legitimate dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Contribute seemingly benign code with a hidden malicious payload](./attack_tree_paths/contribute_seemingly_benign_code_with_a_hidden_malicious_payload.md)

A sophisticated method of introducing vulnerabilities that can be difficult to detect during code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create a pod with a name similar to a popular one](./attack_tree_paths/create_a_pod_with_a_name_similar_to_a_popular_one.md)

The crucial step in a typosquatting attack where the attacker creates the deceptive pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create a pod with the same name as an internal dependency](./attack_tree_paths/create_a_pod_with_the_same_name_as_an_internal_dependency.md)

The key action in a dependency confusion attack, exploiting the naming convention.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Podspec Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_podspec_repository.md)

Gaining control over the repository that defines the pod, allowing the attacker to redirect to malicious source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Maintainer Account](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_maintainer_account.md)

A critical point of control, granting the attacker the ability to manipulate a pod directly on the Cocoapods trunk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Push a compromised version of the pod](./attack_tree_paths/push_a_compromised_version_of_the_pod.md)

The action that distributes the malicious code to users of the compromised pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in `pod` Command](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in__pod__command.md)

Leveraging security flaws in the Cocoapods command-line tool itself to execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Cocoapods Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cocoapods_libraries.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Ruby libraries used by Cocoapods, potentially leading to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace legitimate pod with a malicious one](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_pod_with_a_malicious_one.md)

The action in a Man-in-the-Middle attack where the downloaded dependency is swapped with a malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce malicious code within a pod's post-install script](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_within_a_pod's_post-install_script.md)

Inserting code that will be executed during the pod installation process, potentially compromising the developer's environment or the application build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with local Cocoapods installation](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_local_cocoapods_installation.md)

Gaining control over the developer's local Cocoapods environment to manipulate dependency resolution or introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code within the local pod](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerabilities_or_malicious_code_within_the_local_pod.md)

If the application relies on locally developed pods, attackers might target these directly to inject malicious code.
