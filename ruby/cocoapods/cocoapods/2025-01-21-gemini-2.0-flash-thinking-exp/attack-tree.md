## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Cocoapods](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cocoapods.md)

**Compromise Application via Cocoapods:** This is the root goal and therefore a critical node. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_dependency.md)

**Compromise a Dependency:** This is a critical node because controlling a dependency allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the application. It's a direct and effective way to achieve the root goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on a Public Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_a_public_dependency.md)

**Supply Chain Attack on a Public Dependency:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target a publicly available pod used by the application. They identify vulnerable or unmaintained pods, compromise the pod's repository (often through account takeover), push a malicious version, and wait for applications to update and incorporate the compromised code.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This path has a medium likelihood due to the prevalence of unmaintained pods and the possibility of account takeovers. The impact is high because a compromised public dependency can affect many applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Pod's Repository (e.g., GitHub account takeover)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_pod's_repository__e_g___github_account_takeover_.md)

**Compromise the Pod's Repository (e.g., GitHub account takeover):** This is critical because gaining control over a dependency's repository allows the attacker to push malicious versions, impacting all users of that dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on a Private/Internal Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_a_privateinternal_dependency.md)

**Supply Chain Attack on a Private/Internal Dependency:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target internally developed or private pods. They identify these pods, compromise the private repository (through server breaches or credential compromise), push a malicious version, and the application updates to this compromised internal dependency.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** While identifying private dependencies might be lower likelihood, the impact of compromising internal code can be significant. The likelihood of repository compromise depends on the organization's security practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Private Repository (e.g., Git server breach, compromised credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_private_repository__e_g___git_server_breach__compromised_credentials_.md)

**Compromise the Private Repository (e.g., Git server breach, compromised credentials):** Similar to the public repository, compromising a private repository allows attackers to inject malicious code into internal dependencies, potentially affecting multiple internal applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Dependency Resolution Process](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_dependency_resolution_process.md)

**Manipulate the Dependency Resolution Process:** This is a critical node because it represents attacks that subvert the intended way dependencies are managed. Success here can lead to the installation of malicious code without directly compromising individual dependencies initially.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Podspec Retrieval](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_podspec_retrieval.md)

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Podspec Retrieval:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept network traffic during the `pod install` or `pod update` process. They serve a modified podspec that points to a malicious dependency. The application, believing the podspec is legitimate, installs the malicious dependency.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This path has a medium likelihood, especially on less secure networks. The impact is high as it directly leads to the installation of malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Podspec Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_podspec_repository.md)

**Compromise the Podspec Repository:** This is critical because the podspec repository is the central authority for dependency information. Compromising it allows attackers to redirect legitimate dependency requests to malicious sources, affecting many potential targets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Local File Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/local_file_manipulation.md)

**Local File Manipulation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to a developer's machine (through malware, social engineering, etc.). They modify the `Podfile` to include a malicious dependency or modify the `Podfile.lock` to pin to a malicious version. When the developer runs `pod install` or `pod update`, the malicious dependency is installed.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood depends on the security of developer workstations, but the impact is high as it directly injects malicious dependencies.
