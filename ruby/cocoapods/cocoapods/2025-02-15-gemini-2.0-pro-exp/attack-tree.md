## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise a Legitimate Pod [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_a_legitimate_pod__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most significant threat area, focusing on attacks that introduce malicious code into the application through compromised dependencies. It encompasses various supply chain attack methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Supply Chain Attack on Pod Repository](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__supply_chain_attack_on_pod_repository.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Gain Control of Pod Maintainer's Account [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__gain_control_of_pod_maintainer's_account__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a legitimate pod maintainer. This is a critical step because it allows the attacker to directly modify the pod's code or release a malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Phishing/Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__phishingcredential_stuffing__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses phishing emails or credential stuffing attacks (using leaked credentials from other breaches) to steal the maintainer's login credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Typosquatting (Publish a similarly named pod) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__typosquatting__publish_a_similarly_named_pod___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a malicious pod with a name very similar to a popular, legitimate pod (e.g., "AFNetworkng" instead of "AFNetworking"). The goal is to trick developers into accidentally installing the malicious pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1. Create a Pod with a Name Close to a Popular Pod [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__create_a_pod_with_a_name_close_to_a_popular_pod__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical action of creating and publishing the typosquatting pod.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Dependency Confusion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__dependency_confusion__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits the way CocoaPods (and other package managers) resolve dependencies when both public and private repositories are used.  The attacker publishes a malicious pod with the *same name* as an internal, private pod used by the target organization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Publish Malicious Pods with the Same Names to Public Repositories [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__publish_malicious_pods_with_the_same_names_to_public_repositories__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical action of publishing the malicious pod to a public repository, hoping it will be prioritized over the legitimate internal pod.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Existing Pods [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_existing_pods__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities in existing, legitimate pods. This relies on the target application using an outdated or vulnerable version of the pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Identify Vulnerable Pods and Versions Used by the Target [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__identify_vulnerable_pods_and_versions_used_by_the_target__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical reconnaissance step where the attacker identifies which pods and versions the target application is using, and then checks for known vulnerabilities in those versions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with vulnerability scanners)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate the Podfile/Podfile.lock](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_the_podfilepodfile_lock.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Indirect Modification (e.g., via Compromised CI/CD) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__indirect_modification__e_g___via_compromised_cicd___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline and modifies the `Podfile` or `Podfile.lock` during the build process. This allows them to inject malicious pods or change existing pod references without directly modifying the project's source code repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__compromise_cicd_pipeline__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical step of gaining unauthorized access to the CI/CD system. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software, stealing credentials, or social engineering.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (with good CI/CD security)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
