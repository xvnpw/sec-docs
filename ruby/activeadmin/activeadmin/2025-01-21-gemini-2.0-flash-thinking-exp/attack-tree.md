## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to ActiveAdmin Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_activeadmin_interface__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Default or Weak Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Leverage default credentials if not changed [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Attempt to log in using common default credentials (e.g., admin/password, admin/admin) that might not have been changed by the developers.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Very Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
*   **Brute-force weak or common passwords [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Use automated tools to try a large number of common or weak passwords against the ActiveAdmin login form.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data via ActiveAdmin Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_via_activeadmin_interface__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Modify sensitive attributes through ActiveAdmin forms that are not properly protected [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Submit crafted form data to ActiveAdmin endpoints, attempting to modify model attributes that are not intended to be user-editable (e.g., user roles, admin status).
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
**Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   **Inject malicious SQL queries through ActiveAdmin search filters, form inputs, or custom actions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are used in database queries, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium to High
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
**Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Upload malicious files through ActiveAdmin's file upload features, potentially leading to remote code execution [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Upload files containing malicious code (e.g., web shells) through ActiveAdmin's file upload functionality. If the server doesn't properly validate and sanitize these files, the attacker can execute the malicious code.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (as above) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Upload web shells or other malicious executables [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: (Same as above - focusing on the outcome of achieving RCE).
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Leverage known vulnerabilities in gems or libraries used by ActiveAdmin [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in the Ruby gems that ActiveAdmin depends on (e.g., Rails itself, or other ActiveAdmin plugins). This often involves using existing exploits or tools.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the application, lead to code execution [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   Attack Vector: If ActiveAdmin or its dependencies deserialize user-controlled data without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized by the server.
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: High
    *   Skill Level: Advanced to Expert
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

**Inject malicious code into ActiveAdmin's template rendering engine [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   Attack Vector: If developers use custom templates within ActiveAdmin and don't properly sanitize user input within those templates, attackers might be able to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server when the template is rendered.
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Medium to High
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
