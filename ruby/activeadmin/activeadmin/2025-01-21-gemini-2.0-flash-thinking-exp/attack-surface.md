# Attack Surface Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

* **Description:**  ActiveAdmin, like any application with authentication, is vulnerable if default or easily guessable credentials are used for the initial administrator account.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin sets up a basic authentication system. If developers don't change the default credentials or choose weak ones during setup, it becomes an easy entry point.
    * **Example:** An attacker tries common usernames like "admin" with passwords like "password" or "123456" on the ActiveAdmin login page.
    * **Impact:**  Critical. Full administrative access to the application, allowing attackers to view, modify, and delete data, potentially leading to complete compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require complex passwords during the initial setup of the ActiveAdmin administrator account.
        * **Immediately change default credentials:**  The first step after installing ActiveAdmin should be to change the default username and password.
        * **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security beyond just username and password.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

* **Description:**  If ActiveAdmin's RBAC is not properly configured, users might gain access to features or data they shouldn't have, leading to unauthorized actions.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin provides a framework for defining roles and permissions. If these are not granular enough or are misconfigured, it creates vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A user with a "viewer" role can accidentally or intentionally access and modify sensitive data that should only be accessible to an "editor" or "admin" role.
    * **Impact:** High. Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Potential for privilege escalation if lower-privileged users can access administrative functions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Define granular roles and permissions:**  Carefully design roles with the principle of least privilege in mind.
        * **Regularly review and audit RBAC configuration:** Ensure that permissions are still appropriate and haven't been inadvertently widened.
        * **Test RBAC thoroughly:** Verify that users can only access the resources and actions they are authorized for.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  ActiveAdmin often exposes model attributes for editing through forms. If `strong_parameters` are not correctly used, attackers can modify unintended attributes by manipulating form data.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin automatically generates forms based on model attributes, making it easy to expose attributes that should not be directly editable.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the HTML of an ActiveAdmin edit form to include a hidden field for an `is_admin` attribute and sets it to `true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges.
    * **Impact:** High. Data corruption, privilege escalation, and potential bypass of business logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Utilize `strong_parameters` correctly:**  Explicitly define which attributes are permitted for mass assignment in your models and ActiveAdmin configurations.
        * **Avoid exposing sensitive attributes in ActiveAdmin forms:** Only include attributes that are intended to be directly editable by administrators.
        * **Review ActiveAdmin resource configurations:** Ensure that only necessary attributes are being displayed and are editable.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_interface.md)

* **Description:**  If ActiveAdmin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data within its interface (e.g., in filters, search fields, or resource attributes), attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other administrators.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin displays data entered by administrators. If this data is not properly escaped before rendering, it can lead to XSS.
    * **Example:** An attacker enters a malicious JavaScript payload into a record's description field. When another administrator views this record in ActiveAdmin, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their session cookie.
    * **Impact:** High. Session hijacking, account takeover of administrators, and potential for further malicious actions within the administrative interface.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Ensure proper output escaping:**  Utilize Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms in ActiveAdmin views and custom components.
        * **Sanitize user input:**  Sanitize any user-provided data before displaying it in the ActiveAdmin interface.
        * **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** If ActiveAdmin allows file uploads without proper validation and sanitization, attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) that could be executed on the server.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin can be configured to allow file uploads for certain resources. If not secured, this becomes a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through an ActiveAdmin file upload field. If the server is configured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can gain remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Remote code execution, allowing attackers to take complete control of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Validate file types:**  Only allow specific, safe file types to be uploaded.
        * **Sanitize file names:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent execution of malicious code.
        * **Store uploaded files outside the web root:**  Prevent direct access to uploaded files.
        * **Implement virus scanning:**  Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** ActiveAdmin relies on various Ruby gems. Security vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited if not regularly updated.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** By including these dependencies, ActiveAdmin inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a gem used by ActiveAdmin. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from low to critical, including remote code execution or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the dependency)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep ActiveAdmin and its dependencies up-to-date:** Regularly update gems to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Use dependency scanning tools:**  Employ tools like Bundler Audit or Dependabot to identify and alert on vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Actions or Views](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_actions_or_views.md)

* **Description:** Developers extending ActiveAdmin with custom actions or views might introduce security vulnerabilities if they don't follow secure coding practices.
    * **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin provides extensibility, but the security of custom code is the responsibility of the developers.
    * **Example:** A custom action in ActiveAdmin directly executes user-provided input in a system command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can be critical, including remote code execution or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the custom code)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Follow secure coding practices:**  Sanitize input, validate data, and implement proper authorization checks in custom code.
        * **Conduct security reviews of custom code:**  Have custom actions and views reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Adhere to the principle of least privilege:**  Only grant the necessary permissions to custom actions.
