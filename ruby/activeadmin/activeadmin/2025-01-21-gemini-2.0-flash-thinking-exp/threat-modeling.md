# Threat Model Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Checks on Custom Actions](./threats/insufficient_authorization_checks_on_custom_actions.md)

**Threat:** Insufficient Authorization Checks on Custom Actions

**Description:** An attacker could potentially access and execute custom controller actions defined within an ActiveAdmin resource without having the necessary administrative privileges. This is due to missing or improperly implemented authorization checks *within the ActiveAdmin context*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of data, execution of privileged operations, potential for further system compromise depending on the action's functionality.

**Affected Component:**
* `ActiveAdmin::ResourceController` (specifically custom actions defined within)
* `app/admin/<resource>.rb` (where custom actions are defined and authorization should be implemented)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use `authorize_resource` or implement custom authorization logic within custom controller actions defined in ActiveAdmin.
* Ensure that the authorization logic correctly checks for the required roles or permissions within the ActiveAdmin context.
* Thoroughly test all custom actions to verify proper authorization enforcement within ActiveAdmin.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Admin Interface](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_admin_interface.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Admin Interface

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the ActiveAdmin interface could view sensitive data that is displayed in list views, show pages, or form fields. This occurs because ActiveAdmin automatically exposes model attributes, and developers might not restrict sensitive ones.

**Impact:** Disclosure of confidential information, potential violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:**
* `ActiveAdmin::Views::IndexAsTable` (for list views, rendering model data)
* `ActiveAdmin::Views::Pages::Show` (for show pages, rendering model data)
* `ActiveAdmin::Inputs` (for form fields, exposing model attributes)
* Model attributes exposed through ActiveAdmin configuration (or lack thereof).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully select which model attributes are displayed in ActiveAdmin views using ActiveAdmin's configuration options.
* Use `config.remove_filter` to hide sensitive attributes from filters within ActiveAdmin.
* Implement role-based access control to restrict access to specific ActiveAdmin resources or data based on user roles.
* Consider using custom presenters or decorators *within ActiveAdmin* to control data display.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities through ActiveAdmin Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_through_activeadmin_forms.md)

**Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities through ActiveAdmin Forms

**Description:** An attacker with access to the ActiveAdmin interface could potentially modify unintended model attributes by crafting malicious form submissions if `permit_params` is not correctly configured *within the ActiveAdmin resource definition*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, potential for privilege escalation if admin user attributes are modifiable, data corruption.

**Affected Component:**
* `ActiveAdmin::ResourceController` (handling form submissions within ActiveAdmin)
* `app/admin/<resource>.rb` (where `permit_params` is defined for ActiveAdmin forms)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always explicitly define allowed parameters using `permit_params` within the ActiveAdmin resource definition.
* Avoid using `.permit!` without careful consideration within the ActiveAdmin context.
* Regularly review and update `permit_params` as model attributes change in the ActiveAdmin configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling in Admin Interface](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_in_admin_interface.md)

**Threat:** Insecure File Upload Handling in Admin Interface

**Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files through ActiveAdmin's file upload functionality if proper validation and sanitization are not implemented *within the ActiveAdmin configuration or custom upload handling*. This is a direct vulnerability related to how ActiveAdmin handles file uploads.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, defacement of the application, serving malware to users.

**Affected Component:**
* `ActiveAdmin::Inputs::FileInput`
* Controller actions handling file uploads *within ActiveAdmin's scope* (often within `ActiveAdmin::ResourceController`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension, within the ActiveAdmin file input configuration or custom upload logic.
* Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within the ActiveAdmin upload process.
* Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server or with restricted execution permissions, ensuring ActiveAdmin's handling respects these restrictions.
* Consider using a dedicated file upload service or library that provides security features, integrating it with ActiveAdmin.
* Implement virus scanning on uploaded files handled by ActiveAdmin.
