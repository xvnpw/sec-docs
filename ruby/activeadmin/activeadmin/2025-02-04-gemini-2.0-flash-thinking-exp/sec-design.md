# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, ActiveAdmin, aims to provide a rapid application development framework for creating administration interfaces within Ruby on Rails applications. The primary business priority is to significantly reduce the time and effort required to build and maintain administrative panels, allowing developers to focus on core application features. This framework targets businesses that need to manage data, users, and application settings through a user-friendly web interface.

Key business goals include:
- Accelerating the development of administrative interfaces.
- Providing a standardized and maintainable solution for admin panels.
- Empowering developers to quickly create feature-rich admin interfaces without extensive custom coding.
- Reducing the overall cost of developing and maintaining administrative functionalities.

The most important business risks associated with ActiveAdmin are:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework could expose sensitive application data and functionalities to unauthorized access.
- Poorly configured or misused ActiveAdmin instances could lead to data breaches or operational disruptions.
- Dependency on an open-source project introduces a risk of delayed security updates or project abandonment, although ActiveAdmin is a mature and actively maintained project.
- Complexity of customization might lead to inconsistent security implementations across different projects using ActiveAdmin.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Authentication - ActiveAdmin provides built-in authentication mechanisms, often integrated with Rails authentication solutions like Devise. Implemented within ActiveAdmin framework and configurable in Rails application.
- security control: Authorization - ActiveAdmin includes authorization features to control access to resources and actions based on user roles or permissions. Implemented within ActiveAdmin framework and configurable in Rails application.
- security control: Input validation - Rails framework provides default input validation mechanisms, and ActiveAdmin leverages these for data handling within the admin interface. Implemented by Rails framework and used by ActiveAdmin.
- security control: Secure password storage - Rails framework encourages secure password storage practices, and ActiveAdmin relies on these practices when handling user credentials. Implemented by Rails framework and used by ActiveAdmin.
- accepted risk: Reliance on underlying Rails application security - ActiveAdmin's security is heavily dependent on the security of the underlying Rails application and its configurations.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature - Security vulnerabilities might be discovered and publicly disclosed before patches are available.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing of applications using ActiveAdmin to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate risks of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- security control: Rate limiting and throttling on login attempts and sensitive admin actions to prevent brute-force attacks.
- security control: Security scanning of dependencies to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by ActiveAdmin and the Rails application.
- security control: Secure configuration management for ActiveAdmin and the underlying Rails application, including secure storage of secrets and API keys.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate administrators accessing the ActiveAdmin interface.
  - Requirement: Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
  - Requirement: Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage administrator permissions.
  - Requirement: Ensure granular authorization checks for accessing resources and performing actions within ActiveAdmin.
  - Requirement: Regularly review and update administrator roles and permissions.
- Input validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all user inputs within ActiveAdmin to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
  - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the admin interface to prevent XSS.
  - Requirement: Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication between administrators' browsers and the ActiveAdmin interface to protect data in transit.
  - Requirement: Securely store sensitive data at rest, such as API keys or configuration secrets, using encryption.
  - Requirement: Utilize strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries provided by the Rails framework and underlying Ruby environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by ActiveAdmin:
- Data Management: ActiveAdmin is used to manage core application data, including creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records. This is crucial for the application's functionality and business operations.
- User Management: ActiveAdmin often manages user accounts, roles, and permissions, which is essential for controlling access to the application and its data.
- System Configuration: ActiveAdmin can be used to configure application settings and parameters, impacting the overall system behavior and business logic.
- Monitoring and Reporting: ActiveAdmin dashboards may provide insights into application performance and business metrics, supporting operational monitoring and decision-making.

Data being protected and their sensitivity:
- Application Data: The core data managed by the application, which varies depending on the application's purpose. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the data (e.g., customer data, financial records, health information). Sensitivity can range from low to high.
- User Credentials: Administrator usernames and passwords used to access ActiveAdmin. High sensitivity, as compromise can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Configuration Data: Application settings and parameters managed through ActiveAdmin. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the configuration (e.g., API keys, database connection strings). Sensitivity can range from medium to high.
- Audit Logs: Logs generated by ActiveAdmin and the application, recording administrator actions and system events. Medium sensitivity, as they can contain information about system usage and potential security incidents.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific sensitivity level of the data being managed through ActiveAdmin in the target application?
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the application and ActiveAdmin need to adhere to?
- What is the expected user base and administrator roles for the ActiveAdmin interface?
- Are there any specific security features or integrations that are already in place in the target Rails application?
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open-source software and security vulnerabilities?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is rapid development and ease of use of admin interfaces, with security being a secondary but important consideration.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The application using ActiveAdmin is a web application handling sensitive data, requiring a strong security posture for the admin interface. Standard Rails security best practices are assumed to be in place.
- DESIGN: ActiveAdmin is deployed as part of a standard Ruby on Rails application in a cloud environment using a PaaS platform. The build process involves a typical CI/CD pipeline with security scanning.
