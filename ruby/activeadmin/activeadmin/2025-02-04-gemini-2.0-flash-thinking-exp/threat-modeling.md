# Threat Model Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Threat: [Authentication Misconfiguration in ActiveAdmin Integration](./threats/authentication_misconfiguration_in_activeadmin_integration.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Misconfiguration in ActiveAdmin Integration
    *   **Description:**  Developers might misconfigure Devise within the ActiveAdmin context, leading to weak authentication. This could include failing to enforce strong password policies, not enabling MFA, or using insecure session settings specifically for the admin interface. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized admin access through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or session manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the ActiveAdmin interface, allowing attackers to view, modify, or delete sensitive data, and potentially take control of the entire application.
    *   **Affected ActiveAdmin Component:** ActiveAdmin authentication setup, Devise integration within ActiveAdmin, `ActiveAdmin.application.authentication_method`, `ActiveAdmin.application.current_user_method`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements specifically for ActiveAdmin users.
        *   Mandatory implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all ActiveAdmin accounts.
        *   Customize Devise configurations within the ActiveAdmin initializer to ensure secure session management (e.g., session timeout, secure cookies).
        *   Regularly audit and review the authentication configuration for ActiveAdmin and Devise.
        *   Follow security best practices for Devise configuration within a Rails application, paying special attention to the administrative context.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ActiveAdmin](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_activeadmin.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    *   **Description:**  ActiveAdmin's authorization system might be improperly configured, resulting in overly permissive access controls. Attackers, including internal users with lower privileges, could exploit these misconfigurations to access resources, data, or actions they are not authorized for within the ActiveAdmin dashboard. This could involve manipulating roles, exploiting logic flaws in authorization checks defined in `ActiveAdmin.register` blocks or authorization adapters.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation within the admin interface, ability to perform administrative actions beyond intended scope, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected ActiveAdmin Component:** ActiveAdmin Authorization module, `ActiveAdmin::Authorization` classes, Resource registration and configuration (`ActiveAdmin.register`), Authorization adapters (`ActiveAdmin::AuthorizationAdapter`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement granular and least-privilege RBAC within ActiveAdmin, carefully defining permissions for each role.
        *   Clearly define roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege and actual administrative responsibilities.
        *   Thoroughly test and validate ActiveAdmin authorization rules to ensure they function as intended and prevent unintended access.
        *   Regularly review and audit ActiveAdmin authorization configurations and role assignments as user roles and application requirements evolve.
        *   Utilize ActiveAdmin's authorization adapters effectively to enforce consistent and robust access control logic.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Export Leading to Mass Data Exfiltration](./threats/insecure_data_export_leading_to_mass_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Data Export Leading to Mass Data Exfiltration
    *   **Description:** ActiveAdmin's built-in data export features (CSV, XML, JSON) could be insecurely implemented or configured. Attackers, including lower-privileged administrators or compromised accounts, could abuse these features to export large volumes of sensitive data from the application through the admin interface. This could bypass intended access controls designed for the UI, as export functionality might not have the same granular restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Mass data exfiltration, large-scale data breaches, violation of data privacy regulations, significant reputational damage and financial loss.
    *   **Affected ActiveAdmin Component:** Data export features (CSV builder, XML builder, JSON builder), Resource actions, `ActiveAdmin::ResourceController#export_resource`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks specifically for data export functionality within ActiveAdmin, ensuring only highly authorized roles can export data, especially sensitive information.
        *   Limit the amount of data that can be exported in a single request or within a specific timeframe.
        *   Sanitize and filter data *before* export to remove or mask highly sensitive or unnecessary information.
        *   Implement auditing and logging of all data export actions, including the user, resource, and amount of data exported.
        *   Consider disabling or removing data export features entirely if they are not essential and pose an unacceptable risk.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in ActiveAdmin Customizations](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_activeadmin_customizations.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in ActiveAdmin Customizations
    *   **Description:** ActiveAdmin allows for extensive customization of views, dashboards, forms, and filters using Ruby code and templating languages (like ERB or Haml). Developers might inadvertently introduce SSTI vulnerabilities when creating these customizations, especially if they directly embed user-provided input or data from the database into templates without proper sanitization or escaping. Attackers could inject malicious code into these templates, which would then be executed on the server when the template is rendered, potentially gaining full control of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, significant business disruption.
    *   **Affected ActiveAdmin Component:** Custom views, Dashboards, Form customizations, Filters, Templating engine integration within ActiveAdmin, `ActiveAdmin::ViewFactory`, `ActiveAdmin::Component`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly avoid directly embedding user-provided input or unsanitized data from the database into ActiveAdmin templates.
        *   Utilize template engines' built-in escaping mechanisms to prevent code injection.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any data used in custom ActiveAdmin code, especially if it originates from user input or external sources.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding best practices in custom ActiveAdmin code.
        *   Regularly audit and security test custom ActiveAdmin views, dashboards, and forms for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using safer templating patterns and libraries that minimize the risk of SSTI.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Custom ActiveAdmin Integrations](./threats/command_injection_through_custom_activeadmin_integrations.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection through Custom ActiveAdmin Integrations
    *   **Description:**  Developers might create custom ActiveAdmin features or integrations that involve executing system commands based on user input or data retrieved from the database (e.g., file processing, system utilities, external API calls that trigger system commands). If input used in constructing these system commands is not rigorously sanitized, attackers could inject malicious commands. This is especially risky if ActiveAdmin is used to manage system configurations or interact with the underlying server infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, potential takeover of the server infrastructure managed by ActiveAdmin.
    *   **Affected ActiveAdmin Component:** Custom actions, Custom controllers, Integrations with external systems initiated from ActiveAdmin, Any custom code within ActiveAdmin that executes system commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing system commands based on user input or data from the database whenever possible. Seek alternative approaches that do not involve shell execution.
        *   If system commands are absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* input used in constructing the commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.
        *   Utilize parameterized commands or safer alternatives to direct shell execution where available.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the user account under which the application server and ActiveAdmin code are running, limiting the impact of potential command injection.
        *   Regularly audit and security test custom ActiveAdmin integrations for command injection vulnerabilities.
