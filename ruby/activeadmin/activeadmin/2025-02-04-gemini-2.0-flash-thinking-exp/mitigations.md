# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose an authorization gem (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan) and integrate it with ActiveAdmin.
    2.  Define roles that align with administrative responsibilities (e.g., "Content Editor," "User Manager," "System Administrator").
    3.  For each ActiveAdmin resource and action (index, show, create, update, destroy, custom actions), define policies or abilities that specify which roles are authorized to perform them.
    4.  Assign roles to administrator users based on their job functions.
    5.  Within ActiveAdmin resource definitions, use the authorization framework to restrict access based on the current user's role.
    6.  Regularly review and update roles and permissions as administrative needs evolve.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** RBAC prevents administrators from accessing or modifying resources and actions beyond their authorized scope, limiting the impact of compromised accounts or insider threats.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Properly implemented RBAC makes it harder for a lower-privileged administrator to gain access to higher-level administrative functions.
        *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** By limiting access to sensitive data based on roles, RBAC reduces the potential for large-scale data breaches from compromised administrator accounts.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic RBAC is implemented using Pundit. Roles are defined for "Admin" and "Super Admin."  Authorization is applied to some key resources but not comprehensively.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Granular roles (e.g., "Content Editor," "User Manager") need to be defined.  Authorization policies need to be implemented and enforced for all ActiveAdmin resources and actions.  Regular role and permission audits are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Custom ActiveAdmin Features](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_custom_activeadmin_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all custom actions, filters, form inputs, and any custom code within your ActiveAdmin configuration that handles user input.
    2.  For each input field:
        *   **Validation:** Implement server-side validation to ensure input data conforms to expected formats, types, and constraints (e.g., using Rails validations in models or custom validators).
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code before processing or storing it (e.g., using Rails' `sanitize` helper or parameterized queries for database interactions).
    3.  Specifically for database queries within custom actions or filters, always use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection. Never construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.
    4.  Test input validation and sanitization thoroughly with various valid and invalid inputs, including boundary cases and malicious payloads.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Sanitization helps prevent stored XSS by removing or escaping malicious scripts embedded in user input that could be displayed to other administrators.
        *   **Command Injection (Medium Severity):** If custom code executes system commands based on user input, validation and sanitization are crucial to prevent command injection attacks.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Validation ensures data conforms to expected formats, preventing data corruption or application errors.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (Stored):** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Command Injection:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Input validation is generally used in models for standard ActiveAdmin resources. Sanitization is used in some areas where user-provided HTML is allowed (e.g., content fields). Parameterized queries are used by default by ActiveRecord.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Custom ActiveAdmin actions and filters have not been specifically reviewed for input validation and sanitization.  Areas where raw SQL might be used in custom reports or data exports need to be checked for SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Consistent sanitization across all user inputs in ActiveAdmin needs to be verified.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Data Exposure in ActiveAdmin Views](./mitigation_strategies/limit_data_exposure_in_activeadmin_views.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review all ActiveAdmin resource configurations (index pages, show pages, forms).
    2.  On index pages, only display essential columns necessary for administrative overview and actions. Remove columns displaying sensitive or unnecessary data. Use `index do ... columns do ... end end` block in ActiveAdmin resource definition to customize displayed columns.
    3.  On show pages, carefully select the attributes to display.  Hide sensitive attributes that are not essential for viewing records. Use `show do ... attributes_table do ... row :attribute_name if authorized?(:view_sensitive_data, resource) ... end end` to conditionally display attributes based on authorization.
    4.  In forms, only include necessary fields for editing.  Avoid pre-filling forms with sensitive data unnecessarily.
    5.  Consider using attribute masking or redaction techniques in ActiveAdmin views for highly sensitive data (e.g., displaying only the last few digits of a credit card number).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data through the ActiveAdmin interface.
        *   **Data Breaches (Low Severity - Reduced Impact):** If an administrator account is compromised, limiting data exposure in views reduces the amount of sensitive data immediately visible to the attacker.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Data Breaches:** Low Risk Reduction (Reduced Impact)

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Some basic customization of displayed columns in index pages is done. Show pages generally display all attributes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review of data exposure in all ActiveAdmin views is needed.  Conditional display of sensitive attributes based on authorization is not implemented. Attribute masking or redaction is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Audit Logging for Admin Actions](./mitigation_strategies/implement_audit_logging_for_admin_actions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose an audit logging gem (e.g., `audited`, `paper_trail`).
    2.  Install and configure the chosen audit logging gem in your Rails application.
    3.  Configure the gem to track relevant changes made through ActiveAdmin, such as:
        *   Creation, updates, and deletion of records for key models.
        *   User authentication and authorization events *within ActiveAdmin*.
        *   Changes to user roles and permissions *within ActiveAdmin*.
        *   Execution of critical custom actions *in ActiveAdmin*.
    4.  Store audit logs securely and ensure they are protected from unauthorized access and modification.
    5.  Implement a mechanism to review and analyze audit logs for security monitoring, incident investigation, and compliance purposes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Actions (Medium Severity):** Audit logs provide a record of who performed what actions within ActiveAdmin, aiding in the detection and investigation of unauthorized activities.
        *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Audit logs can help detect and deter malicious actions by authorized administrators within ActiveAdmin.
        *   **Data Breaches (Low Severity - Post-Incident Analysis):** Audit logs are crucial for post-incident analysis to understand the scope and impact of a data breach originating from ActiveAdmin actions and identify the root cause.
        *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Audit logs for administrative actions within ActiveAdmin are often required for compliance with security and data privacy regulations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Data Breaches:** Low Risk Reduction (Post-Incident Analysis)
        *   **Compliance Violations:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No audit logging is currently implemented for ActiveAdmin actions. Basic Rails application logs exist, but they are not specifically focused on administrative actions within ActiveAdmin.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Audit logging needs to be implemented using a dedicated gem, specifically configured to track actions within ActiveAdmin. Configuration needs to be set up to track relevant ActiveAdmin actions. Secure storage and review mechanisms for audit logs are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Code Reviews for ActiveAdmin Customizations](./mitigation_strategies/security_code_reviews_for_activeadmin_customizations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for code reviews for all ActiveAdmin customizations, including:
        *   Custom actions and controllers.
        *   Custom views and form inputs.
        *   JavaScript code added to ActiveAdmin.
        *   Changes to ActiveAdmin configuration.
    2.  Ensure that code reviews are performed by developers with security awareness, specifically regarding ActiveAdmin security best practices.
    3.  Focus code reviews on identifying potential security vulnerabilities *introduced by ActiveAdmin customizations*, such as:
        *   Authentication and authorization flaws *in custom ActiveAdmin code*.
        *   Input validation and sanitization issues *in custom ActiveAdmin code*.
        *   Output encoding problems (XSS) *in custom ActiveAdmin views*.
        *   SQL injection vulnerabilities *in custom ActiveAdmin database interactions*.
        *   Information disclosure risks *in custom ActiveAdmin features*.
    4.  Use static analysis security tools to automatically scan *custom ActiveAdmin code* for potential vulnerabilities.
    5.  Document code review findings and ensure that identified security issues are addressed before deploying customizations to production.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code (Variable Severity):** Code reviews help prevent the introduction of security vulnerabilities in custom ActiveAdmin code, which could range from low to high severity depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
        *   **Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues (Variable Severity):** Code reviews can identify logic errors in custom ActiveAdmin code that could inadvertently create security loopholes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code:** Medium to High Risk Reduction (depending on code complexity and review thoroughness)
        *   **Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic code reviews are performed for all code changes, but security is not a primary focus of these reviews, especially concerning ActiveAdmin specific code. No specific security code review process exists for ActiveAdmin customizations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal security code review process needs to be established specifically for ActiveAdmin customizations. Security checklists and training for developers on secure ActiveAdmin development are missing. Static analysis security tools are not used for custom ActiveAdmin code.
