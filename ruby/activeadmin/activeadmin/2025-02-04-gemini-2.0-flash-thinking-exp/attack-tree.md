## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise ActiveAdmin Application ***[Root Node - Critical Entry Point]***](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_activeadmin_application__root_node_-_critical_entry_point_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. All subsequent attacks aim to reach this point.
*   **How it works:** Successful exploitation of any vulnerability within ActiveAdmin or the application using it leads to compromising the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Represents complete failure of security, leading to potential data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all layers: authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, dependency management, and regular security testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Bypass Authentication ***[Critical Node - Entry Point]***](./attack_tree_paths/2__bypass_authentication__critical_node_-_entry_point_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing the login process to gain unauthorized access to the ActiveAdmin dashboard.
*   **How it works:** Exploiting weaknesses in authentication mechanisms, such as default credentials, brute-forcing, session hijacking, or flaws in custom authentication code.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Authentication is the first line of defense. Bypassing it grants immediate access to the admin interface and its functionalities.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong passwords, implement MFA, rate limiting, secure session management, and rigorously review custom authentication logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Default Credentials (if mistakenly left) **[Path]** -> ***[Node - Critical Misconfiguration]*** Access Admin Dashboard with Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_default_credentials__if_mistakenly_left___path__-__node_-_critical_misconfiguration__acce_ab08bbd8.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using default usernames and passwords that are often set during initial setup and mistakenly left unchanged.
*   **How it works:** Attackers try common default credentials (e.g., "admin/password") to log in to the ActiveAdmin dashboard.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Trivial to exploit if default credentials are present. Provides immediate and complete admin access.
*   **Mitigation:**  Force password change upon initial setup, remove or disable default accounts, regularly audit user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Brute-force/Credential Stuffing Admin Login **[Path]** -> ***[Node - Common Attack Vector]*** Gain Access with Cracked/Stolen Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/4__brute-forcecredential_stuffing_admin_login__path__-__node_-_common_attack_vector__gain_access_wit_2731c44a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Trying numerous username/password combinations to guess valid credentials (brute-force) or using lists of previously compromised credentials (credential stuffing).
*   **How it works:** Attackers use automated tools to attempt logins with various credentials against the ActiveAdmin login form.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Common and effective attack, especially if passwords are weak or reused. Can lead to full admin access.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, implement rate limiting on login attempts, account lockout policies, and consider using CAPTCHA.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if present in ActiveAdmin or custom code) **[Path - if XSS exists]** (within Session Hijacking Path)](./attack_tree_paths/5__cross-site_scripting__xss___if_present_in_activeadmin_or_custom_code___path_-_if_xss_exists___wit_513bb9dd.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In this context, to steal session cookies.
*   **How it works:** If ActiveAdmin or custom code contains XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject JavaScript that steals admin user's session cookies.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Allows session hijacking, leading to account takeover and full admin access.
*   **Mitigation:**  Sanitize all user inputs, encode outputs, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Logic Flaws in Custom Authentication Code **[Path - if custom auth is weak]** -> Bypass Custom Checks](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_logic_flaws_in_custom_authentication_code__path_-_if_custom_auth_is_weak__-_bypass_custom_8460caea.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic that extends or replaces ActiveAdmin's default authentication.
*   **How it works:** Attackers analyze custom authentication code for logic errors, race conditions, or other flaws that can be bypassed to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Custom code is often less tested than core framework code and can introduce vulnerabilities that bypass intended security.
*   **Mitigation:**  Rigorous code review, security testing of custom authentication logic, follow secure coding practices, and consider using well-vetted authentication libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Weak or Misconfigured Authorization Rules in ActiveAdmin **[Path]** -> ***[Node - Common Misconfig]*** Guessing Resource URLs **[Path]** & Parameter Tampering to Access Restricted Actions **[Path]** & Privilege Escalation **[Path]** -> Manipulate User Roles via Admin Interface (if possible due to misconfig) **[Path - if misconfigured]](./attack_tree_paths/7__weak_or_misconfigured_authorization_rules_in_activeadmin__path__-__node_-_common_misconfig__guess_fa46332a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how ActiveAdmin resources and actions are protected by authorization rules.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Guessing Resource URLs:** Attackers try to access admin resources by directly guessing URLs, bypassing intended authorization checks.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Attackers modify request parameters to access or perform actions they are not authorized for.
    *   **Manipulating User Roles:** If role management is misconfigured within ActiveAdmin, attackers might be able to elevate their privileges by directly modifying user roles through the admin interface itself.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Authorization flaws can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions, potentially leading to privilege escalation and data breaches.
*   **Mitigation:** Define clear and strict authorization rules using ActiveAdmin's DSL or a dedicated authorization library, implement the principle of least privilege, regularly review and audit authorization rules, and properly secure role management functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in ActiveAdmin Actions **[Path]** -> ***[Node - Common Vulnerability]*** Access/Modify Data of Other Users/Entities **[Path]** -> Manipulate IDs in URLs/Forms to Access Unauthorized Records **[Path]](./attack_tree_paths/8__insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_activeadmin_actions__path__-__node_-_common_vulnerabi_ac18d0f7.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing or modifying data objects by directly manipulating identifiers (IDs) in URLs or forms without proper authorization checks.
*   **How it works:** Attackers change IDs in requests to access records belonging to other users or entities, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Common web vulnerability that can lead to significant data breaches and unauthorized data modification.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement proper authorization checks before accessing or modifying any data based on user-provided IDs. Never assume authenticated users are authorized to access any ID. Use indirect object references or UUIDs instead of predictable sequential IDs where appropriate.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in ActiveAdmin Forms **[Path]** -> Modify Protected Attributes via Form Submission **[Path]** -> Inject Malicious Parameters in Form Data **[Path]](./attack_tree_paths/9__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_activeadmin_forms__path__-_modify_protected_attributes_via_for_8bbe7666.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Modifying attributes that are not intended to be user-editable by injecting extra parameters in form submissions.
*   **How it works:** Attackers add hidden or unexpected parameters to form data, potentially modifying protected attributes like roles, permissions, or internal system settings.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Can lead to privilege escalation, data corruption, or bypassing security controls if protected attributes are inadvertently modified.
*   **Mitigation:** Use `permit_params` in ActiveAdmin resource definitions to explicitly control which attributes can be mass-assigned. Be cautious with `permit_all_parameters`. Regularly review permitted parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Template Injection in Custom ActiveAdmin Views/Dashboards **[Path - if custom views are vulnerable]** -> ***[Node - RCE]*** RCE via ERB or other Template Engines **[Path - if custom views are vulnerable]](./attack_tree_paths/10__template_injection_in_custom_activeadmin_viewsdashboards__path_-_if_custom_views_are_vulnerable__10a182a2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into templates that are rendered by the application, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How it works:** If custom ActiveAdmin views or dashboards use user-controlled input directly in template rendering (e.g., using ERB or similar engines), attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed on the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  RCE is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to completely control the server and application.
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid using user input directly in template rendering. If necessary, sanitize and escape user input properly before using it in templates. Use secure templating practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. File Upload Vulnerabilities in ActiveAdmin Forms (if file uploads enabled) **[Path - if file uploads enabled]** -> ***[Node - RCE]*** Web Shell Upload **[Path - if file uploads enabled]](./attack_tree_paths/11__file_upload_vulnerabilities_in_activeadmin_forms__if_file_uploads_enabled___path_-_if_file_uploa_12b25c31.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious files, such as web shells, through ActiveAdmin file upload forms to gain RCE.
*   **How it works:** If ActiveAdmin allows file uploads without proper security measures, attackers can upload a web shell (a script that allows remote command execution) and then access it to execute commands on the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Web shell upload provides a direct path to RCE and full system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** If file uploads are necessary, implement robust file type validation, size limits, and store uploaded files securely (outside web root). Scan uploaded files for malware. Avoid direct execution of uploaded files. Disable file uploads if not required.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Command Injection (less likely directly in AA core, but possible in custom actions/code) **[Path - if custom actions are vulnerable]** -> ***[Node - RCE]*** OS Command Injection **[Path - if custom actions are vulnerable]](./attack_tree_paths/12__command_injection__less_likely_directly_in_aa_core__but_possible_in_custom_actionscode___path_-__a1e20553.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious operating system commands into input fields or parameters that are then executed by the application.
*   **How it works:** If custom ActiveAdmin actions or code interact with the operating system and use user-controlled input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject OS commands that get executed on the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  OS Command Injection leads to RCE and full system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid executing OS commands based on user input whenever possible. If necessary, sanitize and validate user input rigorously before using it in OS commands. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to system calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) leading to Data Leakage **[Path]** -> Access Sensitive Data of Other Users/Entities **[Path]** -> View Personally Identifiable Information (PII) **[Path]](./attack_tree_paths/13__insecure_direct_object_references__idor__leading_to_data_leakage__path__-_access_sensitive_data__ebdc113c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to IDOR for data modification, but focused on information disclosure.
*   **How it works:** Attackers manipulate IDs to access sensitive data (like PII or confidential business data) of other users or entities through ActiveAdmin interfaces.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Leads to data breaches, privacy violations, and potential reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement proper authorization checks for all data access operations based on user-provided IDs. Follow the principle of least privilege and only expose necessary data through the admin interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [14. Brute-force Login Attempts (DoS on Authentication System) **[Path]** -> Lockout Legitimate Users **[Path]** -> Account Lockout due to Repeated Failed Login Attempts **[Path]](./attack_tree_paths/14__brute-force_login_attempts__dos_on_authentication_system___path__-_lockout_legitimate_users__pat_e7db4eac.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Overwhelming the authentication system with login attempts to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **How it works:** Attackers launch a large number of login requests, potentially locking out legitimate admin users due to account lockout policies or simply overloading the authentication system.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Can disrupt admin access and potentially the entire application if the authentication system is critical for other functionalities.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts, robust account lockout policies, and consider using CAPTCHA to differentiate between legitimate users and bots.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Vulnerable ActiveAdmin Gem Version **[Path - if not updated]** -> ***[Node - RCE Risk]*** RCE Vulnerabilities in Older Versions **[Path - if not updated and vulnerable version used]*** (within Supply Chain Attacks & Dependency Vulnerabilities ***[Critical Node - External Risk]***](./attack_tree_paths/15__vulnerable_activeadmin_gem_version__path_-_if_not_updated__-__node_-_rce_risk__rce_vulnerabiliti_04c22820.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the ActiveAdmin gem.
*   **How it works:** If the application uses an old version of ActiveAdmin with known security vulnerabilities (especially RCE vulnerabilities), attackers can exploit these publicly known vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Using vulnerable dependencies is a significant supply chain risk. RCE vulnerabilities in dependencies can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly update ActiveAdmin and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
