#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

The strategy identifies two main threats:

*   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code (Variable Severity):**
    * **Analysis:** This is a primary concern with any application customization.  ActiveAdmin, while providing a robust framework, relies on developers to implement secure customizations.  The severity can range from low (minor information disclosure) to high (critical authentication bypass or remote code execution) depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Effectiveness of Mitigation:** Code reviews are highly effective in mitigating this threat, especially when combined with security awareness and static analysis.  The effectiveness depends on the thoroughness and quality of the reviews.

*   **Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues (Variable Severity):**
    * **Analysis:** Logic errors, even if not directly related to known vulnerability patterns, can create security loopholes.  For example, incorrect authorization logic or flawed data handling can lead to unintended access or data manipulation.
    * **Effectiveness of Mitigation:** Code reviews are crucial for identifying logic errors.  Experienced reviewers can analyze code flow and identify potential logical flaws that might not be caught by automated tools.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis

The strategy assesses the impact as:

*   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code:** Medium to High Risk Reduction (depending on code complexity and review thoroughness)
*   **Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction

    * **Analysis:** These impact assessments are reasonable. Code reviews, when performed effectively, can significantly reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. The "Medium to High" range acknowledges that the effectiveness depends on the quality and depth of the reviews.  Logic errors are often harder to detect automatically, making manual review particularly important, hence the "Medium" risk reduction.
    * **Justification:**  Manual code review is a proven method for vulnerability detection.  For complex customizations, a thorough review by security-aware developers can be highly effective in identifying and preventing a wide range of security issues.  However, it's not a silver bullet and should be part of a layered security approach.

#### 4.4. Current Implementation and Missing Implementation Analysis

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic code reviews are performed, but security is not a primary focus, especially for ActiveAdmin specific code.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal security code review process for ActiveAdmin customizations, security checklists, developer training, and static analysis tools.

    * **Analysis:** This highlights a significant gap.  While basic code reviews are a good starting point, they are insufficient for proactively addressing security risks in ActiveAdmin customizations. The missing components are essential for a robust security code review process.
    * **Implications of Missing Implementation:**  Without a formal process, security vulnerabilities are likely to be missed during code reviews, increasing the risk of deploying vulnerable ActiveAdmin customizations to production. This can lead to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security incidents.
