#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

The mitigation strategy correctly identifies key threats associated with ActiveAdmin customizations:

*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Code (High Severity):**  Accurate. Custom code, especially if it handles user input or interacts with databases, is a prime target for injection attacks. Severity is high due to potential for data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Views (High Severity):** Accurate. Custom views that display user-generated content without proper encoding are vulnerable to XSS. Severity is high due to potential for account hijacking, data theft, and malware distribution.
*   **Authorization Bypass in Custom Actions (Medium to High Severity):** Accurate. Custom actions that are not properly integrated with ActiveAdmin's authorization mechanisms or introduce flaws in authorization logic can lead to unauthorized access. Severity ranges from medium to high depending on the sensitivity of the accessed resources and functionalities.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Accurate.  Introducing new dependencies through custom extensions can bring in known vulnerabilities. Severity depends on the vulnerability and the affected dependency.

**Overall Threat Assessment:** The listed threats are relevant and accurately represent the major security risks associated with ActiveAdmin customizations.  The severity ratings are also generally appropriate.

**Potential Gaps:** While the listed threats are comprehensive for *common* web application vulnerabilities, consider also:

*   **Logic flaws in custom code:**  Beyond injection and XSS, custom code can have business logic vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
*   **Information disclosure:** Customizations might inadvertently expose sensitive information through logging, error messages, or insecure data handling.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Inefficient or poorly designed custom code could be exploited to cause DoS.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis

The impact estimations are also reasonable and aligned with the threats:

*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Code:** High Risk Reduction (if reviewed and secured).  Effective security review and remediation can significantly reduce the risk of code injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Views:** High Risk Reduction (if reviewed and secured). Proper output encoding and security review are highly effective in preventing XSS.
