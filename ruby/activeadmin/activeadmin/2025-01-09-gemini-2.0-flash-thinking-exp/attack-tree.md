## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Bypass Authentication/Authorization **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_bypass_authenticationauthorization_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in ActiveAdmin's or the underlying authentication gem's logic to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypass Authentication/Authorization - Success here grants immediate and privileged access.
*   **Critical Node:** Gain Access to Admin Panel - Represents the successful breach of the authentication barrier.
*   **Why High Risk:** High Impact (full admin control) and potentially Medium Likelihood (due to common authentication vulnerabilities or default credential issues). Low Effort and Skill if default credentials are used.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Data Manipulation/Exfiltration via Admin Interface](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_data_manipulationexfiltration_via_admin_interface.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging the admin interface to directly manipulate or extract sensitive data, often through vulnerabilities in input handling or authorization.
*   **Critical Node:** Modify or Extract Sensitive Data - The successful culmination of data breach or manipulation.
*   **Critical Node:** Modify Sensitive Data Without Authorization - Exploiting mass assignment to alter data without proper permissions.
*   **Critical Node:** Access or Modify Data Belonging to Other Entities - Exploiting IDOR to access data beyond the attacker's authorized scope.
*   **Why High Risk:** High Impact (data breaches, data corruption) and Medium Likelihood (due to common web application vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Mass Assignment, and IDOR).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Admin Interface **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_remote_code_execution__rce__via_admin_interface_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within ActiveAdmin that allow the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This often involves file uploads or flaws in code generation/processing.
*   **Critical Node:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Admin Interface - Represents the ability to execute code, granting maximum control.
*   **Critical Node:** Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server - The successful execution of malicious code, leading to full compromise.
*   **Critical Node:** Execute Arbitrary Code During Admin Panel Rendering - Injecting code that executes when an admin page is loaded.
*   **Critical Node:** Trigger Vulnerability through ActiveAdmin Functionality - Using a feature of ActiveAdmin to trigger an RCE vulnerability in a dependency.
*   **Why High Risk:** Very High Impact (full server compromise) and Low to Medium Likelihood (depending on the specific vulnerability, file upload vulnerabilities are relatively common).
