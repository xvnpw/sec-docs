# Threat Model Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Threat: [Insecure Default Credentials](./threats/insecure_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker might attempt to access the ActiveAdmin interface using default credentials that were not changed after installation. This directly involves the initial setup or default configuration provided by ActiveAdmin.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the administrative interface, allowing the attacker to perform any administrative action.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, potentially the initial setup process within ActiveAdmin.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change default credentials upon installation of ActiveAdmin.
*   Consider removing or disabling default accounts provided by ActiveAdmin if they are not needed.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Authentication Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_authentication_logic.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom authentication mechanisms *within ActiveAdmin* (e.g., overriding ActiveAdmin's authentication methods), vulnerabilities in this custom code could allow attackers to bypass authentication. This directly stems from how ActiveAdmin allows customization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the administrative interface.

**Affected Component:** Custom authentication overrides or extensions *within ActiveAdmin*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test any custom authentication logic implemented *within ActiveAdmin*.
*   Follow secure coding practices when customizing ActiveAdmin's authentication.
*   Consider the security implications before overriding default ActiveAdmin authentication.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Admin Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_admin_forms.md)

**Description:** Attackers could manipulate HTTP requests to include parameters that modify model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible through *ActiveAdmin forms*. This is a direct consequence of how ActiveAdmin handles form submissions and model updates.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., modifying user roles via ActiveAdmin), unauthorized modification of sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** Form handling within ActiveAdmin, specifically how ActiveAdmin processes form parameters and updates models.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong parameter filtering (e.g., `permit_params`) in ActiveAdmin resource definitions to explicitly allow only intended attributes.
*   Avoid exposing sensitive attributes in ActiveAdmin forms unless absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** Attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through *ActiveAdmin's file upload features* if proper validation and sanitization are not implemented *within ActiveAdmin's handling of uploads*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, malware distribution.

**Affected Component:** File upload functionality within ActiveAdmin forms and controllers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension, *within ActiveAdmin's file upload processing*.
*   Sanitize uploaded filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities *within ActiveAdmin*.
*   Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a separate, controlled mechanism.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Interface](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into *ActiveAdmin pages* if input is not properly sanitized before being displayed *by ActiveAdmin*. This directly relates to how ActiveAdmin renders views.

**Impact:** Admin account compromise, ability to perform actions on behalf of other administrators, potential for further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** View rendering within ActiveAdmin, especially where user-provided data is displayed *by ActiveAdmin*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust output encoding (escaping) for all user-provided data displayed in *ActiveAdmin views*.
*   Utilize ActiveAdmin's features for safe rendering of content.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom Filters or Actions](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_filters_or_actions.md)

**Description:** If developers write custom filters or actions *within ActiveAdmin* that directly execute raw SQL queries without proper sanitization of user-provided input, attackers could inject malicious SQL code. This is a risk introduced by ActiveAdmin's extensibility.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, potential for complete database compromise.

**Affected Component:** Custom filters, custom actions *within ActiveAdmin*, any code directly interacting with the database using raw SQL *within ActiveAdmin*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using raw SQL queries within ActiveAdmin customizations whenever possible.
*   Use your ORM's (e.g., ActiveRecord) query interface with parameterized queries or prepared statements within ActiveAdmin to prevent SQL injection.
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input used in database queries *within ActiveAdmin*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_extensions.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in custom ActiveAdmin extensions or plugins developed for specific application needs can introduce vulnerabilities *directly within the ActiveAdmin interface*.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code, potentially leading to any of the threats listed above.

**Affected Component:** Custom extensions, custom code within ActiveAdmin.

**Risk Severity:** Varies, potentially Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions for ActiveAdmin.
*   Thoroughly review and test custom code for vulnerabilities.
*   Consider security audits for custom ActiveAdmin extensions.

## Threat: [Overriding Security Features with Insecure Custom Code](./threats/overriding_security_features_with_insecure_custom_code.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently or intentionally override default security features *of ActiveAdmin* with less secure custom implementations *within ActiveAdmin*.

**Impact:** Weakening of the overall security posture of the admin interface, potentially introducing new vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Any part of ActiveAdmin where default behavior is overridden *by custom code within ActiveAdmin*.

**Risk Severity:** Varies, potentially High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review any modifications to ActiveAdmin's default behavior.
*   Ensure that custom implementations maintain or improve security *within the ActiveAdmin context*.
*   Document any intentional deviations from default security practices *within ActiveAdmin*.
