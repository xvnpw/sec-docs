# Attack Surface Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Attack Surface: [Default Admin Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The presence of default, well-known credentials for the initial administrator account.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin generates an initial admin user, often with predictable or easily guessable default credentials (e.g., username "admin", password "password").
    *   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the ActiveAdmin panel using the default username and password.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the administrative interface, allowing attackers to manage all data, users, and potentially execute arbitrary code if custom actions are vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default admin credentials during the initial setup process.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all administrator accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Mass Assignment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_mass_assignment.md)

*   **Description:** The ability to modify unintended model attributes through web requests due to insufficient parameter filtering.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin often exposes model attributes directly in forms for editing. If strong parameter whitelisting is not configured in the ActiveAdmin resource definition, attackers can potentially modify sensitive attributes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `is_admin` attribute of a user record through the ActiveAdmin interface by including it in the submitted form data, even if the form doesn't explicitly display it.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized modification of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly define permitted parameters using `permit_params` within each ActiveAdmin resource definition.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining permitted parameters, only allowing necessary attributes to be updated.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing or manipulating resources by directly referencing their IDs in URLs without proper authorization checks.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin uses URLs that often include record IDs (e.g., `/admin/users/1/edit`). If authorization is not strictly enforced for each action within the ActiveAdmin context, attackers can potentially access or modify resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Example:** An attacker changes the ID in the URL to access or edit a user profile that belongs to another administrator, bypassing intended access controls within the ActiveAdmin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of other users' data, or potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks using gems like Pundit or CanCanCan within ActiveAdmin resource actions.
        *   Ensure authorization checks are performed by ActiveAdmin before any data retrieval or modification based on URL parameters.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Filters and Search](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_filters_and_search.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries through user-supplied input.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin's filtering and search functionality can be vulnerable if user input processed by ActiveAdmin is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries, especially when using custom filters or complex search logic defined within ActiveAdmin.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious string in a filter field within the ActiveAdmin interface that, when processed, results in the execution of arbitrary SQL code against the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features that automatically handle input sanitization within ActiveAdmin customizations.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize user input in custom filters and search implementations within ActiveAdmin.
        *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries directly from user input within ActiveAdmin customizations.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Input Fields](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_input_fields.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** If user-provided data within the ActiveAdmin interface (e.g., in form fields) is not properly sanitized by ActiveAdmin before being rendered, it can lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities within the admin panel.
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters a malicious JavaScript payload into a text field in the ActiveAdmin interface. When another administrator views the record through ActiveAdmin, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the administrative interface, or redirection to malicious sites targeting administrators.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user-provided input before rendering it in the ActiveAdmin interface.
        *   Utilize Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms for outputting data in ActiveAdmin views.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources within the ActiveAdmin panel.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the file upload functionality to execute malicious code or access sensitive files.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** If ActiveAdmin allows file uploads (through direct model associations or custom forms), vulnerabilities like unrestricted file uploads, path traversal, or XSS via uploaded files can be introduced specifically within the administrative context.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image file through an ActiveAdmin form. If the server is not properly configured, this script could be executed, granting the attacker remote code execution within the administrative environment.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, access to sensitive files, or denial of service affecting the administrative interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types and extensions on the server-side within the ActiveAdmin upload handling logic.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct access via ActiveAdmin.
        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within the ActiveAdmin file management.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files handled by ActiveAdmin.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Actions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced through custom actions defined within ActiveAdmin resources.
    *   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** Developers can define custom actions to extend ActiveAdmin's functionality. If these actions are not implemented with security in mind within the ActiveAdmin context, they can introduce various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A custom action within ActiveAdmin that executes shell commands based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom actions defined within ActiveAdmin for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Sanitize user input before using it in any external commands or database queries within ActiveAdmin custom actions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when implementing custom actions within ActiveAdmin.
