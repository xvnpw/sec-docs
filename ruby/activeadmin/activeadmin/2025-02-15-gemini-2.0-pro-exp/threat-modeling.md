# Threat Model Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via CanCanCan/Pundit Misconfiguration (Active Admin Specific)](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_cancancanpundit_misconfiguration__active_admin_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the *Active Admin-specific* authorization configuration (using CanCanCan, Pundit, or a custom authorization adapter) to access or modify resources they shouldn't have permission to. This focuses on misconfigurations *within* the Active Admin resource definitions and how they interact with the authorization library, *not* general misconfigurations of the library itself. The attacker might try manipulating URLs or parameters specific to Active Admin's routing and resource handling.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed within Active Admin, ability to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., deleting records, modifying user roles) within the Active Admin interface, and potential escalation of privileges *within the scope of Active Admin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Authorization adapter integration *within* Active Admin resource definitions (specifically the `permit_params` and `controller` blocks, and how they interact with CanCanCan's `Ability` class or Pundit policies), and any custom authorization logic *specific to Active Admin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Active Admin Context):** Grant Active Admin users only the minimum necessary permissions *within the Active Admin interface*. Define granular permissions for each Active Admin resource and action.
    *   **Comprehensive Ability Definitions (Active Admin Focus):** Carefully define abilities in CanCanCan or policies in Pundit, ensuring that all possible *Active Admin* actions are covered and that permissions are correctly assigned *within the context of Active Admin's resource management*.
    *   **Test Authorization Thoroughly (Active Admin Resources):** Write comprehensive tests to verify that authorization rules are working as expected *specifically for Active Admin resources and actions*. Test both positive and negative cases.
    *   **Regularly Update Authorization Libraries (and Active Admin):** Keep CanCanCan, Pundit, *and Active Admin itself* up-to-date.
    *   **Avoid Overly Permissive Rules (within Active Admin):** Be extremely cautious with wildcard permissions or rules that grant broad access *within Active Admin resource definitions*.

## Threat: [IDOR within Active Admin Resources](./threats/idor_within_active_admin_resources.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates resource IDs in Active Admin's URLs or parameters to access or modify data belonging to other users or entities. This occurs when Active Admin's controllers don't properly enforce authorization checks *after* authentication, relying solely on the user being logged in and having *some* level of access to Active Admin. The attacker exploits Active Admin's routing and resource handling.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed *within Active Admin*, ability to modify data belonging to other users *through the Active Admin interface*, and potential data breaches *originating from Active Admin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Active Admin resource controllers, specifically how they handle resource retrieval and updates based on IDs *within Active Admin's routing and controller logic*. The `show`, `edit`, `update`, and `destroy` actions *as implemented by Active Admin* are particularly vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authorization on Every Action (Active Admin Controllers):** Ensure that authorization checks (using CanCanCan, Pundit, or a custom solution) are performed on *every* action within Active Admin resource controllers, not just on initial access. Verify that the current user has permission to access the *specific* resource being requested *within the context of Active Admin*.
    *   **Use Scoped Queries (within Active Admin):** When retrieving resources *within Active Admin controllers*, use scoped queries that limit the results to those the current Active Admin user is authorized to access.
    *   **Avoid Exposing Internal IDs (in Active Admin URLs):** Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers for resources to make it harder for attackers to guess valid IDs *that Active Admin uses*.

## Threat: [XSS via Custom Active Admin Components](./threats/xss_via_custom_active_admin_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into *custom* Active Admin views, actions, or form components. This is specific to vulnerabilities introduced by *developer-created customizations within Active Admin*, not general XSS in the application. The attacker might submit a form within Active Admin with malicious JavaScript in a text field that is then rendered unsafely within another Active Admin page.
*   **Impact:** The attacker's script could be executed in the browser of other Active Admin users, potentially stealing their Active Admin session cookies, redirecting them to malicious websites, or defacing the Active Admin interface. This impacts the Active Admin environment specifically.
*   **Affected Component:** *Custom* Active Admin views (`app/admin/*.rb`), custom form components *within Active Admin*, custom actions *defined within Active Admin*, and any code that renders user-provided input *within the Active Admin context*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Escape User Input (within Active Admin):** Always escape user input before rendering it in HTML *within Active Admin's custom components*. Use Rails' built-in escaping helpers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (for Active Admin):** Implement a CSP, paying particular attention to how it affects Active Admin's functionality and ensuring it protects against XSS within Active Admin.
    *   **Input Validation (within Active Admin):** Validate user input on the server-side *within Active Admin's custom code* to ensure it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code.
    *   **Use Formtastic Safely (within Active Admin):** While Formtastic (often used with Active Admin) provides some built-in escaping, ensure you are using it correctly *within your Active Admin customizations* and not bypassing its security features.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Custom Filters or Actions (Active Admin Specific)](./threats/sql_injection_via_custom_filters_or_actions__active_admin_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into *custom* Active Admin filters or actions that interact directly with the database. This is specific to vulnerabilities introduced by *developer-created customizations within Active Admin* that bypass ActiveRecord's safe query methods. The attacker might enter SQL code into a custom filter field *defined within an Active Admin resource*.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting any data accessible through Active Admin. This is a direct compromise through Active Admin's custom code.
*   **Affected Component:** *Custom* Active Admin filters (defined using `filter` *within an Active Admin resource*), custom actions *within Active Admin* that execute raw SQL queries, and any code *within Active Admin* that interacts directly with the database without using ActiveRecord's safe query methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use ActiveRecord (within Active Admin):** Always use ActiveRecord's query methods within Active Admin customizations. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries.
    *   **Avoid String Interpolation (within Active Admin):** Never use string interpolation to build SQL queries with user input *within Active Admin code*. Use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's query interface.
    *   **Input Validation (within Active Admin):** Validate user input on the server-side *within Active Admin's custom code* to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Prepared Statements (if raw SQL is unavoidable within Active Admin):** If you *must* use raw SQL within Active Admin (which should be extremely rare and well-justified), use prepared statements with parameterized inputs.

## Threat: [Unsafe File Uploads within Active Admin](./threats/unsafe_file_uploads_within_active_admin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files through Active Admin's file upload functionality. This is specific to how *Active Admin* handles file uploads, not general file upload vulnerabilities in the application. The attacker might upload a PHP script disguised as an image *through an Active Admin form*.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining complete control of the application and the server, *initiated through the Active Admin interface*.
*   **Affected Component:** Active Admin resource configurations that include file upload fields (using `formtastic` or custom forms *within Active Admin*), and how Active Admin processes and stores these uploaded files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Type Validation (within Active Admin):** Strictly validate the file type of uploaded files *within Active Admin's upload handling*, allowing only specific, safe extensions. Use a robust file type detection library.
    *   **File Size Limits (within Active Admin):** Enforce file size limits *within Active Admin's upload handling*.
    *   **Store Files Outside Web Root (and configure Active Admin to do so):** Store uploaded files in a directory outside the web root, and ensure Active Admin is configured to use this location.
    *   **Rename Uploaded Files (within Active Admin):** Rename uploaded files *as part of Active Admin's upload process* to prevent attackers from guessing filenames.
    *   **Virus Scanning (triggered by Active Admin):** Integrate virus scanning into Active Admin's file upload process.
    *   **Content-Type Validation (within Active Admin):** Validate the `Content-Type` header *within Active Admin's upload handling*, but don't rely on it solely.

## Threat: [Unsafe use of `eval` or Dynamic Code Generation (within Active Admin)](./threats/unsafe_use_of__eval__or_dynamic_code_generation__within_active_admin_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer uses `eval` or similar methods to dynamically generate code *within Active Admin customizations*, and an attacker manages to inject malicious code into this process. This is specific to the use of `eval` *within Active Admin's code*.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, *triggered through Active Admin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Any *custom* Active Admin code (actions, views, helpers, etc.) that uses `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, `module_eval`, or similar methods *within the `app/admin` directory or related Active Admin configuration*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `eval` (within Active Admin):** Absolutely avoid using `eval` or any form of dynamic code generation that relies on user input *within Active Admin code*.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization (if `eval` is unavoidable - which it shouldn't be, within Active Admin):** If `eval` is used (which is strongly discouraged), implement extremely strict input sanitization and validation *specifically within the Active Admin context*.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Batch Actions (Active Admin Specific)](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_batch_actions__active_admin_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the parameters of an Active Admin batch action (e.g., deleting multiple records) to affect resources they shouldn't have access to. This is specific to how *Active Admin* handles batch operations and their associated parameters.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of multiple records *through Active Admin's batch action interface*, potentially causing significant data loss or corruption *managed by Active Admin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Active Admin's batch actions, specifically how they handle the selection and processing of multiple resources *within Active Admin's controller logic and parameter handling*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authorization Checks within Batch Actions (Active Admin):** Ensure that authorization checks are performed *for each resource* within an Active Admin batch action, not just for the batch action itself. Verify that the current user has permission to perform the action on *every* selected resource *within the context of Active Admin*.
    *   **Scoped Queries for Batch Actions (Active Admin):** Use scoped queries to retrieve the resources to be processed by an Active Admin batch action, ensuring that only resources the current Active Admin user is authorized to access are included.
    *   **Confirmation Steps (within Active Admin):** Implement confirmation steps for Active Admin batch actions, especially destructive ones.
