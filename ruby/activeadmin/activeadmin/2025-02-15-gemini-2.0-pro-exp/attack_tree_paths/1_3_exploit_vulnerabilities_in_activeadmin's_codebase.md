# Deep Analysis of ActiveAdmin Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection and RCE

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and provide mitigation strategies for potential SQL Injection and Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities within an application utilizing the ActiveAdmin framework, specifically focusing on the attack tree path outlined below.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following attack tree path:

*   **1.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in ActiveAdmin's Codebase**
    *   **1.3.2 SQL Injection in ActiveAdmin's Data Handling [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.2.1 Unsafe Use of `ransack` (if custom queries are used improperly) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **1.3.2.2 Vulnerable Custom Filters or Scopes [CRITICAL]**
        *   **1.3.2.3 Direct SQL Queries in Custom Actions (avoid this!) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **1.3.3 Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.3.1 Unsafe File Uploads (if ActiveAdmin is used to manage file uploads) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **1.3.3.1.1 Lack of File Type Validation/Sanitization [CRITICAL]**
        *   **1.3.3.3 Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (e.g., outdated `arbre` or other gems) [CRITICAL]**

The analysis will *not* cover other potential attack vectors outside this specific path (e.g., XSS, CSRF, authentication bypasses *unless* they directly contribute to the vulnerabilities within this scope).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the application's codebase, focusing on ActiveAdmin resource definitions, custom actions, filters, scopes, and any areas handling user input or file uploads.  This includes reviewing Ruby code, configuration files, and potentially JavaScript code interacting with ActiveAdmin.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Utilizing automated static analysis tools (e.g., Brakeman, RuboCop with security-focused rules) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Checking for outdated or vulnerable dependencies using tools like `bundler-audit` or `gemnasium`.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describing how dynamic analysis (penetration testing) *could* be used to confirm vulnerabilities, but not performing actual dynamic testing within the scope of this document.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Considering potential attacker motivations and capabilities to understand the likelihood and impact of successful exploits.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. SQL Injection (1.3.2)

SQL Injection vulnerabilities arise when user-supplied data is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.  ActiveAdmin, while providing some built-in protections, can be vulnerable if misused.

#### 4.1.1. Unsafe Use of `ransack` (1.3.2.1) [CRITICAL]

*   **Vulnerability Description:** `ransack` is a powerful search gem, but custom predicates and scopes can be dangerous.  If user input is directly concatenated into a `ransack` predicate without proper escaping, it can lead to SQL injection.

*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```ruby
    # In an ActiveAdmin resource
    filter :name_contains, as: :string, filters: [:cont]

    # In a custom scope or predicate
    scope :custom_search, ->(query) { where("name LIKE '%#{query}%'") } # VULNERABLE!
    ```
    An attacker could input `%'; DROP TABLE users; --` into the `name_contains` filter, potentially deleting the `users` table.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Use `ransack`'s built-in predicates and matchers whenever possible.**  These are generally safe.
    *   **If custom predicates are *absolutely* necessary, use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's query methods:**

        ```ruby
        scope :custom_search, ->(query) { where("name LIKE ?", "%#{query}%") } # SAFE
        # OR
        scope :custom_search, ->(query) { where(arel_table[:name].matches("%#{query}%")) } # SAFE (using Arel)
        ```
    *   **Avoid string concatenation within `ransack` predicates or scopes.**
    *   **Validate and sanitize user input *before* it reaches the `ransack` logic, even if using parameterized queries (defense in depth).**  This might involve limiting input length, allowed characters, etc.

*   **Code Review Focus:** Search for any custom `ransack` predicates or scopes that use string interpolation or concatenation with user-provided input.

*   **Static Analysis:** Brakeman can often detect unsafe use of `ransack` with custom predicates.

#### 4.1.2. Vulnerable Custom Filters or Scopes (1.3.2.2) [CRITICAL]

*   **Vulnerability Description:** Similar to the `ransack` issue, custom filters or scopes defined outside of `ransack` that directly construct SQL queries using user input are highly vulnerable.

*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```ruby
    # In an ActiveAdmin resource
    filter :custom_filter, as: :string, filters: [:eq]

    # Custom filter logic (VULNERABLE!)
    controller do
      def apply_filtering(chain)
        if params[:q] && params[:q][:custom_filter_eq]
          chain = chain.where("some_column = '#{params[:q][:custom_filter_eq]}'")
        end
        super(chain)
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Always use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's query methods.**
    *   **Avoid raw SQL in custom filters and scopes.**
    *   **Validate and sanitize user input before using it in any database interaction.**

*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine all custom filter and scope implementations for direct SQL construction using user input.

*   **Static Analysis:** Brakeman and RuboCop (with security extensions) can identify potentially unsafe SQL queries.

#### 4.1.3. Direct SQL Queries in Custom Actions (1.3.2.3) [CRITICAL]

*   **Vulnerability Description:**  Using `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute` or similar methods to execute raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input is extremely dangerous.

*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```ruby
    # In an ActiveAdmin resource
    action_item :dangerous_action, only: :show do
      link_to "Run Dangerous Query", dangerous_action_admin_resource_path(resource, query: params[:query])
    end

    member_action :dangerous_action, method: :get do
      ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{params[:query]}") # VULNERABLE!
      redirect_to admin_resource_path(resource), notice: "Query executed!"
    end
    ```

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Absolutely avoid using raw SQL queries with user input.**
    *   **Use ActiveRecord's query interface (e.g., `find`, `where`, `find_by`) for all database interactions.**  These methods provide built-in protection against SQL injection when used correctly.
    *   **If complex queries are needed, use Arel or parameterized queries.**

*   **Code Review Focus:**  Scrutinize all custom actions for any use of `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute` or similar methods.

*   **Static Analysis:**  Static analysis tools are highly effective at detecting direct SQL query execution.

### 4.2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) (1.3.3)

RCE vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, providing them with a high level of control.

#### 4.2.1. Unsafe File Uploads (1.3.3.1) [HIGH RISK]

*   **Vulnerability Description:** If ActiveAdmin is used to manage file uploads, and the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize uploaded files, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, shell scripts) that can be executed on the server.

*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    *   ActiveAdmin allows uploading files with any extension.
    *   Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory.
    *   No validation of file content is performed.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **4.2.1.1 Lack of File Type Validation/Sanitization [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Strict File Type Validation (Whitelist):**  Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).  *Do not* use a blacklist (e.g., blocking `.php`, `.exe`).  Attackers can often bypass blacklists.
        *   **Validate the File's "Magic Bytes":**  Check the file's header (magic bytes) to verify its actual type, not just its extension.  Libraries like `file` (in Ruby) can be used for this.  This prevents attackers from renaming a `.php` file to `.jpg` and bypassing extension checks.
        *   **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Web Root:**  Store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* directly accessible via the web server.  Serve files through a controller action that performs authentication and authorization checks.
        *   **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to randomly generated names to prevent attackers from guessing file names and directly accessing them.
        *   **Use a File Upload Library:**  Consider using a well-vetted file upload library like `CarrierWave` or `Shrine`, which provide built-in security features.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded and executed by the browser, mitigating the impact of some RCE vulnerabilities.
        *  **Scan for malware:** Use some malware scanning solution to check uploaded files.

*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine all file upload handling code, paying close attention to file type validation, storage location, and file renaming.

*   **Static Analysis:**  Static analysis tools can sometimes detect missing file type validation.

#### 4.2.2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (1.3.3.3) [CRITICAL]

*   **Vulnerability Description:** ActiveAdmin depends on various Ruby gems (e.g., `arbre`, `formtastic`, `inherited_resources`).  If these gems have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to gain RCE.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Use `bundle update` to keep all gems up-to-date.
    *   **Use Dependency Auditing Tools:**  Employ tools like `bundler-audit` or `gemnasium` to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.  Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories related to ActiveAdmin and its dependencies.

*   **Code Review Focus:**  While code review won't directly identify vulnerable dependencies, it's important to be aware of the dependencies used and their potential risks.

*   **Static Analysis:**  Dependency auditing tools are the primary method for identifying vulnerable dependencies.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

This deep analysis has highlighted several critical areas within the specified ActiveAdmin attack tree path where SQL Injection and RCE vulnerabilities could exist.  The key takeaways and recommendations are:

*   **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  Never use string concatenation or interpolation to build SQL queries with user input.  Always use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's safe query methods.
*   **Secure File Uploads:**  Implement strict file type validation (whitelist and magic byte checks), store files outside the web root, rename files, and consider using a dedicated file upload library.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update all gems and use dependency auditing tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Continuous Security Testing:**  Integrate static analysis and dependency auditing into your CI/CD pipeline.  Consider periodic penetration testing to identify and confirm vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.  Avoid using a database user with administrative privileges.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigations, the development team can significantly enhance the security of the ActiveAdmin-based application and protect it from potential attacks.
