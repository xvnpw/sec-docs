# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authorization with Pundit/CanCanCan within ActiveAdmin](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authorization_with_punditcancancan_within_activeadmin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install Pundit or CanCanCan:** (Same as before - necessary for integration)
    2.  **Generate Policies:** (Same as before)
    3.  **Define Policy Rules:** (Same as before - crucial for ActiveAdmin-specific actions)
    4.  **Integrate with ActiveAdmin:** *This is the key ActiveAdmin-specific step.* In your ActiveAdmin resource definitions (e.g., `app/admin/articles.rb`), use the authorization helpers.  For Pundit:
        *   Use `authorize resource` within controller actions (e.g., `before_action { authorize @article }` in a custom action).
        *   Use `policy(resource).show?` within views (e.g., to conditionally show/hide buttons).
        For CanCanCan:
        *   Use `load_and_authorize_resource` at the top of your ActiveAdmin resource definition.  This automatically applies authorization checks to all standard actions.  Customize with `skip_authorize_resource` or `authorize_resource` for specific actions if needed.
    5.  **Test Authorization:** (Same as before)
    6.  **Regular Audits:** (Same as before)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass (within ActiveAdmin) (Critical):** Prevents users from accessing ActiveAdmin resources or performing actions they are not authorized for *through the ActiveAdmin interface*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within ActiveAdmin) (Critical):** Prevents users from gaining higher privileges than they should have *within ActiveAdmin*.
    *   **Batch Action Abuse (within ActiveAdmin) (High):** Prevents unauthorized use of ActiveAdmin's batch actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Privilege Escalation (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Batch Action Abuse (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Pundit gem is installed.
    *   Policy files exist for `Article`, `User`, and `Comment` resources.
    *   Basic authorization checks are in place for standard ActiveAdmin actions (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `destroy`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Policy files are missing for `Product` and `Order` resources *as managed through ActiveAdmin*.
    *   Authorization checks are not consistently applied to ActiveAdmin batch actions.
    *   Comprehensive tests for authorization logic *specifically within ActiveAdmin* are lacking.
    *   No regular audit schedule is in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Permitted Parameters in ActiveAdmin Resource Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_permitted_parameters_in_activeadmin_resource_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `permit_params`:** In *each ActiveAdmin resource definition* (e.g., `app/admin/articles.rb`), find the `permit_params` declaration. This is *within* the ActiveAdmin configuration.
    2.  **List Allowed Attributes:** (Same as before - but the location is key)
    3.  **Handle Nested Attributes:** (Same as before - but within the ActiveAdmin `permit_params`)
    4.  **Test Mass Assignment (within ActiveAdmin):** Write tests that specifically interact with the ActiveAdmin interface (e.g., using Capybara) to verify that only the permitted attributes can be mass-assigned through ActiveAdmin forms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment (via ActiveAdmin) (High):** Prevents attackers from modifying attributes they should not have access to *through the ActiveAdmin interface*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible, assuming comprehensive `permit_params` definitions within ActiveAdmin).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `permit_params` is defined for most ActiveAdmin resources.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `permit_params` is missing for the `Order` resource *within its ActiveAdmin definition*.
    *   Nested attributes are not properly handled for the `Product` resource (which has nested `Variant` attributes) *within the ActiveAdmin `permit_params`*.
    *   Mass assignment tests that specifically target the ActiveAdmin interface are incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CSV/Excel Export within ActiveAdmin](./mitigation_strategies/secure_csvexcel_export_within_activeadmin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Export Definitions:** Locate all `csv` and `xls` blocks *within your ActiveAdmin resource definitions*. This is entirely within ActiveAdmin's configuration.
    2.  **Sanitize Potentially Dangerous Fields:** (Same as before - but applied within the ActiveAdmin `csv` block)
    3.  **Validate Data Types:** (Same as before - within the ActiveAdmin export context)
    4.  **Test Exports:** (Same as before)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CSV Formula Injection (via ActiveAdmin exports) (Medium):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious formulas into CSV/Excel files *generated by ActiveAdmin*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSV Formula Injection (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low/Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No specific sanitization is currently implemented for ActiveAdmin CSV exports.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization logic needs to be added to all ActiveAdmin CSV export definitions, particularly for fields that contain user-provided text.
    *   Testing of exported files generated by ActiveAdmin for formula injection is not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Moderate ActiveAdmin Comments](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_moderate_activeadmin_comments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Necessity:** Determine if the ActiveAdmin comments feature is essential.
    2.  **Disable (if not needed):** If comments are not required, disable them *globally in your ActiveAdmin configuration* (`config/initializers/active_admin.rb`) by setting `config.comments = false`. This is a direct ActiveAdmin setting.
    3.  **Moderate (if needed):** If comments are enabled, implement moderation.  This could involve configuring ActiveAdmin's comment settings (e.g., requiring approval) or using a gem that integrates with ActiveAdmin.
    4. **Sanitize Input (Within ActiveAdmin):** Ensure that any custom handling of comments within ActiveAdmin (e.g., custom views displaying comments) properly sanitizes the input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS via ActiveAdmin Comments (High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts through ActiveAdmin's comment feature.
    *   **Spam/Malicious Links (via ActiveAdmin Comments) (Medium):** Reduces the risk of users posting spam or links to malicious websites through ActiveAdmin comments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via ActiveAdmin Comments:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Spam/Malicious Links (ActiveAdmin Comments):** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   ActiveAdmin comments are currently enabled.
    *   Basic sanitization is applied to comment input (but this is a general practice, not ActiveAdmin-specific).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No ActiveAdmin comment moderation system is in place.
    *   The option to disable ActiveAdmin comments has not been considered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control ActiveAdmin Resource Registration and Actions](./mitigation_strategies/control_activeadmin_resource_registration_and_actions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Resource Registrations:** Carefully examine your `app/admin` directory.  Only register resources that *absolutely need* to be managed through ActiveAdmin.
    2.  **Explicitly Define Actions:** Within each ActiveAdmin resource definition (e.g., `app/admin/articles.rb`), use the `actions` directive to explicitly specify which actions are permitted.  Avoid `actions :all` unless strictly necessary.  Example: `actions :all, except: [:destroy]`.
    3.  **Control Batch Actions:**  Either disable batch actions entirely (`config.batch_actions = false` in `config/initializers/active_admin.rb`) or explicitly define and authorize them within each resource.  Use the `batch_action` block with a custom authorization check.
    4. **Manage Menu Items:** Use the `menu` option in your resource definitions to control how resources appear in the ActiveAdmin navigation menu.  You can conditionally show/hide menu items based on user roles or permissions. Example: `menu if: proc{ current_admin_user.can_access_products? }`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources (via ActiveAdmin) (High):** Prevents users from accessing resources they shouldn't through the ActiveAdmin interface.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions (via ActiveAdmin) (High):** Prevents users from performing actions they shouldn't on resources through ActiveAdmin.
    *   **Batch Action Abuse (via ActiveAdmin) (High):** Prevents unauthorized use of ActiveAdmin's batch actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Unauthorized Actions (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Batch Action Abuse (ActiveAdmin):** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Most resources have `actions` defined, but some use `actions :all`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `Product` resource uses `actions :all`.
    *   Batch actions are enabled globally, but not all resources have specific authorization checks for them.
    * Menu items are not conditionally controlled based on user permissions.
