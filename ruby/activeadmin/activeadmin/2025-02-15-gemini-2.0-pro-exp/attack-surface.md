# Attack Surface Analysis for activeadmin/activeadmin

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Resource Level)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__resource_level_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to ActiveAdmin resources (data and actions) due to misconfigured authorization policies.
*   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin's centralized administrative interface and reliance on authorization adapters (Pundit, CanCanCan) increase the impact of authorization flaws. A single misconfiguration can expose entire datasets or administrative functions. This is a *core* ActiveAdmin concern.
*   **Example:** A `Pundit` policy that incorrectly grants `index` access to all users for a `SensitiveData` resource, exposing confidential information.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege Policies:** Implement strict "least privilege" authorization policies.
    *   **Comprehensive Policy Review:** Thoroughly review and test *all* authorization policies, focusing on the interaction between ActiveAdmin's DSL and the authorization library.
    *   **Automated Authorization Testing:** Employ automated testing of authorization rules.
    *   **Explicit Action Control:** Explicitly define *only* allowed actions using `actions :index, :show...`. Do *not* rely on defaults.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of authorization policies.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Batch Actions)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__batch_actions_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized execution of operations on multiple records via ActiveAdmin's batch actions due to insufficient authorization checks within the batch action logic.
*   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** Batch actions are a *core ActiveAdmin feature*.  If authorization is not enforced *per record*, it creates a high-impact vulnerability specific to ActiveAdmin's functionality.
*   **Example:** A batch action to "delete users" that doesn't re-check authorization for *each* user, allowing a low-privileged admin to delete high-privileged accounts.
*   **Impact:** Mass data deletion, unauthorized modification of multiple records, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Per-Record Authorization:** Ensure authorization checks are performed *for each individual record* within the batch action's processing loop.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code of all batch actions.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate input to batch actions to prevent manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Bypass (Custom Actions/Filters)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_bypass__custom_actionsfilters_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in custom ActiveAdmin actions or filters due to insufficient input validation, leading to attacks like SQL injection.
*   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** Custom actions and filters are defined *within* ActiveAdmin and executed in its administrative context, making them a direct ActiveAdmin concern. The administrative context amplifies the impact.
*   **Example:** A custom action that takes a user-provided ID and uses it directly in a database query without parameterization (SQL injection).
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, server compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries (or an ORM with equivalent protection).
    *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all output (though less directly related to *input* validation, it's crucial in the ActiveAdmin context).
    *   **Avoid `ransack` Misuse:** Be extremely cautious with `ransack` predicates that allow arbitrary SQL.
    * **Secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Software/Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_softwaredependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of ActiveAdmin or its *direct* dependencies.
*   **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** This is directly related to the security of the ActiveAdmin gem itself and the gems it *explicitly* uses (e.g., `ransack`, `formtastic`).
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of `ransack` is exploited through ActiveAdmin's filtering.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but can range from information disclosure to complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update ActiveAdmin and its *direct* dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Use `bundler-audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for ActiveAdmin and its dependencies.
    * **Automated dependency updates:** Use tools to automate dependency updates.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication/Lack of MFA](./attack_surfaces/weak_authenticationlack_of_mfa.md)

* **Description:** Use of weak passwords or absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for ActiveAdmin administrator accounts.
* **How ActiveAdmin Contributes:** ActiveAdmin provides access to the administrative interface, making strong authentication crucial.
* **Example:** An administrator account with a password like "password123" is compromised, granting the attacker full control over the application.
* **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, data modification.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for all administrator accounts, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all administrator accounts. This adds an extra layer of security even if a password is compromised.
    * **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    * **Regular password audits:** Regularly audit passwords.
