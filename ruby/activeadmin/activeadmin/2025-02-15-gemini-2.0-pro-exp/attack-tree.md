## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_administrative_access__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1 Bypass Devise Integration (if misconfigured) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  ActiveAdmin often relies on Devise for authentication.  Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Devise can lead to complete authentication bypass.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Predictable/Weak Devise Secrets [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Devise uses secrets for various security-sensitive operations (e.g., signing cookies, encrypting passwords).  If these secrets are predictable (e.g., default values, easily guessable strings) or weak (short, low entropy), an attacker can forge authentication tokens or decrypt sensitive data.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Devise Configuration Errors (e.g., improper `confirmable`, `recoverable` settings) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Devise offers various modules (e.g., `confirmable` for email confirmation, `recoverable` for password reset).  Misconfiguring these modules (e.g., disabling email confirmation, using weak password reset tokens) can allow attackers to create accounts or take over existing accounts.
        *   **1.1.1.3 Exploit Devise Vulnerabilities (known CVEs in older versions) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Older versions of Devise may contain known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that allow attackers to bypass authentication, escalate privileges, or even execute arbitrary code.  Keeping Devise up-to-date is crucial.

    *   **1.1.3 Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing (targeting ActiveAdmin login) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers can use automated tools to try large numbers of username/password combinations, either guessing common passwords (brute-force) or using credentials leaked from other breaches (credential stuffing).
        *   **1.1.3.1 Weak Password Policies Enforced by ActiveAdmin (or lack thereof) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  If ActiveAdmin (or the underlying application) does not enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, password history), users may choose weak passwords that are easily guessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Authorization Flaws [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_authorization_flaws__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.2.1 Improper Access Control to ActiveAdmin Resources [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  ActiveAdmin relies on authorization libraries (e.g., `cancancan`, `pundit`) to control access to resources and actions.  Misconfigurations or flaws in the authorization logic can allow users to access resources or perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
        *   **1.2.1.1 Misconfigured `cancancan` or `pundit` (or custom authorization logic) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Incorrectly defined abilities in `cancancan` or `pundit` can grant users unintended access.
            *   **1.2.1.1.1 Incorrect Ability Definitions (allowing unauthorized actions) [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:**  The core of authorization is defining which users can perform which actions on which resources.  Errors in these definitions (e.g., granting `manage` access to all users) are critical vulnerabilities.
        *   **1.2.1.2 Direct Object Reference Vulnerabilities (accessing resources by ID without proper checks) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  If ActiveAdmin allows users to access resources directly by their ID (e.g., `/admin/users/123`) without verifying that the user is authorized to access that specific resource, an attacker can potentially access data belonging to other users.
        *   **1.2.1.3 Insecure Defaults in Resource Registration (e.g., all actions permitted by default) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** When registering a new resource in ActiveAdmin, if the developer doesn't explicitly define which actions are permitted for each role, ActiveAdmin might default to allowing all actions, creating a significant security risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in ActiveAdmin's Codebase](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_activeadmin's_codebase.md)

*   **1.3.2 SQL Injection in ActiveAdmin's Data Handling [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  If user input is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
        *   **1.3.2.1 Unsafe Use of `ransack` (if custom queries are used improperly) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** `ransack` is a gem used by ActiveAdmin for searching and filtering. While generally safe if used correctly, custom `ransack` predicates or scopes that incorporate user input without proper sanitization can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **1.3.2.2 Vulnerable Custom Filters or Scopes [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Custom filters or scopes defined within ActiveAdmin that use raw SQL or improperly sanitized user input can be vulnerable to SQL injection.
        *   **1.3.2.3 Direct SQL Queries in Custom Actions (avoid this!) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Using raw SQL queries directly in ActiveAdmin custom actions is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.  This is a direct path to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **1.3.3 Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  RCE vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, giving them complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
        *   **1.3.3.1 Unsafe File Uploads (if ActiveAdmin is used to manage file uploads) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** If ActiveAdmin allows users to upload files, and the application does not properly validate and sanitize these files, an attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a web shell) that can be executed on the server.
            *   **1.3.3.1.1 Lack of File Type Validation/Sanitization [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:**  The most critical aspect of secure file uploads is validating the file type (using a whitelist of allowed types, *not* a blacklist) and sanitizing the file content to prevent malicious code from being executed.
        *   **1.3.3.3 Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (e.g., outdated `arbre` or other gems) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** ActiveAdmin, like any software, relies on other libraries (gems).  If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to gain RCE.  Keeping all dependencies up-to-date is crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1.2 Download Large Datasets via CSV/XML/JSON Export (if not properly restricted) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** ActiveAdmin often provides functionality to export data in various formats (CSV, XML, JSON).  If this functionality is not properly restricted, an attacker (or even a legitimate user with malicious intent) can download large amounts of sensitive data.

*   **2.2 Access Data Through Unauthorized Means (requires gaining some level of access - see branch 1) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** This category depends on successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in Branch 1 (Gaining Unauthorized Access).
    *   **2.2.1 Direct Database Access (after gaining RCE or SQLi) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If an attacker gains RCE or SQL injection, they can directly access the database and exfiltrate all data, bypassing any application-level controls.

*   **2.3 Leverage Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities**
    *   **2.3.1 Error Messages Revealing Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Error messages that are too verbose or reveal internal details (e.g., database queries, file paths, stack traces) can provide attackers with valuable information that can be used to craft further attacks.
    *   **2.3.2 Debug Information Left Enabled in Production [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Leaving debugging features enabled in a production environment can expose sensitive information, including source code, configuration details, and internal application state.
