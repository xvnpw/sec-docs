# Attack Surface Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Attack Surface: [Direct Exposure of `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/direct_exposure_of___env__file.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file, containing sensitive environment variables, is directly accessible to attackers via a web request.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv` encourages the use of a `.env` file to store secrets, making this file a central point of vulnerability if its location is exposed.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `https://example.com/.env` and downloads the file.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and connected services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** place the `.env` file within the web server's document root.
    *   Configure the web server to explicitly deny access to all files starting with a dot (`.`).

## Attack Surface: [Source Code Repository Inclusion](./attack_surfaces/source_code_repository_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file is accidentally committed to a source code repository.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** Developers using `dotenv` might mistakenly treat the `.env` file as a regular project file and commit it.
*   **Example:** A developer commits the `.env` file to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of all secrets to anyone with access to the repository.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file *before* the initial commit.
    *   Use tools like `git-secrets` to scan for potential secrets before committing.
    *   If committed, *immediately* rotate secrets and rewrite repository history (but assume compromise).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Backup Exposure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_backup_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Backups of the application directory include the `.env` file, and these backups are not secured.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** The presence of the `.env` file makes it susceptible to inclusion in insecure backups.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to an unencrypted backup containing the `.env` file.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of all secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exclude the `.env` file from backups.
    *   Store environment variables separately in a secure, encrypted location if backups are needed.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file has overly permissive file permissions.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** Developers might not set appropriate file permissions on the `.env` file.
*   **Example:** The `.env` file is world-readable on a shared hosting environment.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of secrets to other users on the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set file permissions to be as restrictive as possible (e.g., `600` or `400`).

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage via Logs/Errors](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_via_logserrors.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive environment variables loaded by `dotenv` are accidentally logged.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv` makes loading secrets easy, increasing the risk of accidental logging.
*   **Example:** An application error logs the value of a database password.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of secrets through log files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* log sensitive information directly.
    *   Use logging libraries with redaction/masking capabilities.
    *   Store logs securely.

## Attack Surface: [Production Use of `.env`](./attack_surfaces/production_use_of___env_.md)

*   **Description:** `dotenv` and `.env` files are used in a production environment.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv` is primarily for development; production use increases exposure risk.
*   **Example:** A production server is deployed with a `.env` file.
*   **Impact:** Increased risk of secret exposure in production.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* use `.env` files in production. Use proper environment variable setting mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Shell Expansion Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/shell_expansion_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Environment variables loaded by `dotenv` are used in shell commands without proper escaping.
*   **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv` loads variables, and if these are used unsafely in shell commands, it creates vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A `.env` file contains `VAR=value; rm -rf /`, used unsafely in a shell command.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate environment variables before use in shell commands.
    *   Use parameterized queries or libraries that handle escaping.
    *   Avoid shell commands when possible.
