## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Access to .env File](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_access_to__env_file.md)

*   **1. Gain Access to .env File**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Local File Inclusion](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_local_file_inclusion.md)

    *   **1.1 Local File Inclusion**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Unprotected Directory](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_unprotected_directory.md)

        *   **1.1.1 Unprotected Directory**
            *   **Description:** The `.env` file is placed in a directory that is directly accessible via the web server (e.g., the web root) without proper access controls. This is a critical configuration error.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (Should be caught in basic setup/review, but surprisingly common)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to all credentials)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just browse to the file)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Obvious in server logs, file access monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 RCE/LFI on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_rcelfi_on_the_server.md)

        *   **1.1.4 RCE/LFI on the Server**
            *   **Description:** If attacker can execute code on the server (via Remote Code Execution or Local File Inclusion), they can simply read the file.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Requires a severe vulnerability)
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Source Code Repository](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_source_code_repository.md)

    *   **1.2 Source Code Repository**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Accidental Commit](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_accidental_commit.md)

        *   **1.2.1 Accidental Commit**  **(Critical Node)**
            *   **Description:** The `.env` file was accidentally committed to the source code repository (e.g., Git). This is a very common mistake and provides direct access to the credentials.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Surprisingly common, especially in less experienced teams)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to all credentials)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (If committed, just clone the repository)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring repository history, but tools can help)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Side Effects of dotenv](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_side_effects_of_dotenv.md)

*   **3. Leverage Side Effects of dotenv**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Accidental Exposure in Logs/Errors](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_accidental_exposure_in_logserrors.md)

    *   **3.1 Accidental Exposure in Logs/Errors**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Debug Mode Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_debug_mode_enabled.md)

        *   **3.1.1 Debug Mode Enabled**
            *   **Description:** The application is running in debug mode, which often leads to more verbose logging.  This can inadvertently expose environment variables in logs or error messages.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake in production environments)
            *   **Impact:** High (Credentials exposed in logs)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just view the logs)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If logs are monitored)
