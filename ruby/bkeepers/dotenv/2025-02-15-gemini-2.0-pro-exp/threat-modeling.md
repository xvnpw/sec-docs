# Threat Model Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Threat: [Unauthorized `.env` File Modification](./threats/unauthorized___env__file_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized `.env` File Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the server file system (through compromised accounts, application vulnerabilities, or misconfigured shares) and modifies the `.env` file. They change sensitive values like database credentials, API keys, or application secrets, potentially pointing them to attacker-controlled resources or services.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete application compromise.
        *   Data breaches (reading, modifying, deleting data).
        *   Unauthorized access to external services.
        *   Application downtime/malfunction.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Dotenv Component:** The `.env` file itself (the core data store). The `dotenv` module's loading function (`config()` or similar) is indirectly affected as it reads the compromised data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict file system permissions: `.env` should be readable *only* by the application's user, with *no* write permissions for anyone.
        *   Store `.env` outside the web root: Never place `.env` in a publicly accessible directory.
        *   Use a secrets management solution: Replace `.env` files with a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) in production.
        *   File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Detect unauthorized changes to the `.env` file.
        *   Regular security audits: Audit server configurations and access controls.

## Threat: [Accidental `.env` File Exposure (Commit to Repository)](./threats/accidental___env__file_exposure__commit_to_repository_.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental `.env` File Exposure (Commit to Repository)

    *   **Description:** A developer accidentally commits the `.env` file, containing sensitive credentials, to a public or private source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This happens if `.env` is not properly excluded via `.gitignore` (or equivalent). Attackers or automated scanners can discover these exposed secrets.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of production or development environments.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Unauthorized access to connected services.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Potential legal/financial consequences.
    *   **Affected Dotenv Component:** The `.env` file itself. The `dotenv` module is indirectly affected as it would load the exposed data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Add `.env` (and variations like `.env.local`, `.env.production`) to the project's `.gitignore` file *before* the first commit.
        *   Use a `.env.example` file: Provide a template (`.env.example`) listing required variables *without* sensitive values. Commit this file.
        *   Educate developers: Train developers on never committing secrets.
        *   Use pre-commit hooks: Automatically check for potential secrets before commits.
        *   Use secret scanning tools: Employ tools like `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`, or GitHub's secret scanning.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Leakage via Debugging/Error Messages](./threats/environment_variable_leakage_via_debuggingerror_messages.md)

*   **Threat:** Environment Variable Leakage via Debugging/Error Messages

    *   **Description:** The application inadvertently exposes environment variables (loaded from `.env` via `dotenv`) in error messages, debugging output, or log files due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities. Attackers could trigger errors or exploit vulnerabilities to view these.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive credentials.
        *   Potential for attackers to gain access to the application or services.
        *   Increased attack surface.
    *   **Affected Dotenv Component:** The environment variables loaded by the `dotenv` module (accessed via `process.env` or similar). The module itself isn't at fault, but it's the source of the leaked data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable debugging in production: Ensure debugging modes, verbose logging, and stack traces are disabled in production.
        *   Robust error handling: Prevent sensitive information in error messages/logs. Log generic messages; store details separately with restricted access.
        *   Sanitize logs: Review and remove sensitive information from logs.
        *   Use a logging framework: Employ a structured logging framework with appropriate log levels for each environment.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Credentials in `.env`](./threats/overly_permissive_credentials_in___env_.md)

*   **Threat:** Overly Permissive Credentials in `.env`

    *   **Description:**  The credentials stored within the `.env` file (and loaded by `dotenv`) possess more permissions than the application strictly requires.  This amplifies the impact of a compromise, allowing an attacker broader access than necessary.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Increased damage from a successful attack.
        *   Potential for privilege escalation or access to unintended data.
    *   **Affected Dotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the values it contains. The `dotenv` module simply loads these overly permissive credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to credentials used by the application.
        *   Regularly review and audit permissions: Periodically check and ensure permissions remain appropriate.
        *   Use separate credentials for different environments: Avoid using the same credentials across development, testing, and production.
