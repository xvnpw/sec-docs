# Threat Model Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of `.env` in Version Control](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of___env__in_version_control.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a version control repository where developers have mistakenly committed the `.env` file. The attacker can then read the `.env` file and extract sensitive environment variables.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially related services. Attackers can use exposed credentials to access databases, APIs, and other resources, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected dotenv component:** `.env` file storage and developer practices.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Add `.env` to `.gitignore` file.
    *   Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent committing `.env`.
    *   Educate developers on secure secret management.
    *   Regularly audit repository history for accidentally committed secrets and remove them.

## Threat: [Web Server Serving `.env` File](./threats/web_server_serving___env__file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an HTTP request to a misconfigured web server, directly requesting the `.env` file. If the web server is incorrectly set up to serve static files from the application root and `.env` is located there, the attacker can download and read the file, exposing sensitive environment variables.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially related services. Exposed credentials can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected dotenv component:** Web server configuration and `.env` file location.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure web server to deny access to `.env` and dotfiles.
    *   Store `.env` outside the web server's document root.
    *   Regularly review web server configurations.

## Threat: [Directory Traversal Vulnerability Leading to `.env` Access](./threats/directory_traversal_vulnerability_leading_to___env__access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the application code. This allows the attacker to navigate the server's file system and access files outside the intended application directories, including the `.env` file, even if it's not directly served by the web server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially related services. Access to `.env` exposes sensitive credentials, leading to potential data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected dotenv component:** Application code interacting with file system and `.env` file location.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent directory traversal.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to avoid directory traversal flaws.
    *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Storing Highly Sensitive Secrets Directly in `.env` Files](./threats/storing_highly_sensitive_secrets_directly_in___env__files.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the `.env` file is not externally exposed, an attacker who gains access to the server through other vulnerabilities can read the local file system and access the `.env` file. If highly sensitive secrets are stored directly in plaintext within `.env`, the attacker immediately gains access to these secrets.
*   **Impact:** Significant impact if server is compromised. Attackers gain direct access to sensitive secrets, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and control over related systems.
*   **Affected dotenv component:** `.env` file content and secret storage practices.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize storing highly sensitive secrets in `.env`, even for development.
    *   Use secure secret management solutions (vault, cloud secret managers) for production.
    *   Consider encrypting `.env` files at rest (with key management considerations).
