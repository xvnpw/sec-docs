# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `dotenv`, aims to simplify the management of environment variables for software applications. It allows developers to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the application's environment at runtime. This is particularly useful for separating configuration from code, especially sensitive information like API keys and database credentials, across different environments (development, staging, production).

Business priorities for using `dotenv` include:
- Simplifying application configuration management across different environments.
- Enhancing developer productivity by providing a consistent way to manage environment variables.
- Reducing the risk of accidentally committing sensitive configuration data into version control.

Key business risks associated with using `dotenv` include:
- Accidental exposure of sensitive information if `.env` files are not properly managed and secured.
- Misconfiguration of applications if `.env` files are not correctly set up or if there are inconsistencies between environments.
- Potential for application downtime or malfunction if environment variables are not loaded correctly or are missing.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Access control to the GitHub repository is managed by GitHub. (Implemented by: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Version control of the code base using Git. (Implemented by: Git)
- accepted risk: The project itself does not enforce secure storage or handling of secrets within `.env` files. This is the responsibility of the user.
- accepted risk: The project relies on the security of the underlying operating system and file system for access control to `.env` files.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipelines to detect accidental commits of `.env` files containing secrets.
- security control: Provide clear documentation and best practices for securely managing `.env` files, emphasizing the importance of not committing them to public repositories and using secure file permissions.
- security control: Consider adding warnings or checks within the library to alert users if `.env` files are world-readable or located in insecure locations.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to `dotenv` itself, as it is a configuration loading library. Authentication is handled by the applications that use `dotenv`.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to `dotenv` itself. Authorization is handled by the applications that use `dotenv` based on the loaded environment variables.
- Input validation: `dotenv` should perform basic validation of the `.env` file format to prevent parsing errors and potential vulnerabilities due to malformed input. This includes checking for valid variable names and values.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for `dotenv` itself. However, applications using `dotenv` might store encrypted secrets in environment variables, and `dotenv` should not interfere with this. If secrets are stored encrypted, the application is responsible for decryption after loading the variables.

## DEPLOYMENT

`dotenv` is a library and does not have a separate deployment architecture in the traditional sense. It is deployed as part of the application that uses it. The deployment architecture is determined by the application itself.

Assuming a typical application deployment scenario (e.g., a web application):

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable application configuration management across different environments.
- Preventing accidental exposure of sensitive configuration data, especially secrets.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Environment variables stored in `.env` files.
- Sensitivity: Can range from low (non-sensitive configuration settings) to high (API keys, database credentials, encryption keys). The sensitivity level is highly dependent on the specific application and the environment variables being managed.  Secrets within environment variables are considered highly sensitive and require strong protection.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the target programming language for the `dotenv` library in question? (While the example is Ruby, `dotenv` exists in many languages).
- What are the primary use cases for this `dotenv` library? Is it primarily for web applications, command-line tools, or other types of software?
- What is the intended deployment environment for applications using `dotenv`? (e.g., cloud platforms, on-premises servers, containers).
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that applications using `dotenv` need to adhere to (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to simplify configuration management and improve developer experience while minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive information.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a secondary consideration compared to ease of use, but still important. Users are expected to take responsibility for securing their `.env` files and managing secrets appropriately. The library itself should provide basic security best practices guidance and avoid introducing vulnerabilities.
- DESIGN: The `dotenv` library is designed as a lightweight, dependency-free library that can be easily integrated into various types of applications. It focuses on reading `.env` files and setting environment variables, without providing advanced features like secret management or encryption.
