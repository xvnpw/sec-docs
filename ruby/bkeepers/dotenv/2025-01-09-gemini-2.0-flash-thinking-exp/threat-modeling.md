# Threat Model Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of `.env` in Version Control](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of___env__in_version_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a version control repository (e.g., Git) where the `.env` file, used by `dotenv` to load environment variables, has been mistakenly committed. They can then clone the repository and access the sensitive information within the `.env` file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords, etc.) managed by `dotenv`, leading to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `.env` file (used by `dotenv`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `.env` file is explicitly listed in the `.gitignore` file.
*   Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent committing files matching the `.env` pattern.
*   Regularly audit the repository for accidentally committed secrets using dedicated tools.
*   Educate developers on the critical importance of excluding sensitive files like `.env` from version control.

## Threat: [Incorrect File Permissions on `.env`](./threats/incorrect_file_permissions_on___env_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the server where the application using `dotenv` is hosted. If the `.env` file has overly permissive file permissions, the attacker can directly read its contents and extract the sensitive environment variables loaded by `dotenv`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials managed by `dotenv`, leading to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `.env` file (used by `dotenv`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `.env` file has restrictive file permissions (e.g., read-only for the application user, no access for others).
*   Implement secure file transfer mechanisms during deployment to maintain correct permissions.
*   Regularly audit file permissions on the server where `.env` files are located.

## Threat: [Exposure of `.env` File in Server Backups](./threats/exposure_of___env__file_in_server_backups.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to server backups that inadvertently include the `.env` file, which contains sensitive environment variables loaded by `dotenv`. They can then restore the backup or extract the file to access this critical information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials managed by `dotenv`, leading to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `.env` file (used by `dotenv`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement explicit processes to exclude the `.env` file from server backups.
*   Encrypt backups containing sensitive data, even if `.env` is excluded as a secondary precaution.
*   Restrict access to backup storage to authorized personnel only.
