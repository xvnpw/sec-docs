# Attack Surface Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of the `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_the___env__file.md)

- **Description:** The `.env` file, containing sensitive environment variables, is unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized individuals or systems.
- **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv`'s core function is to load variables from this file, making its existence and content a critical dependency. The simplicity of using a plain text file increases the risk of accidental exposure.
- **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the `.env` file to a public GitHub repository.
- **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords, etc.), potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **`.gitignore`:** Ensure the `.env` file is explicitly listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits to version control.
    - **Secure File Permissions:** Set restrictive file permissions on the `.env` file (e.g., read-only for the application user).
    - **Avoid Storing in Web-Accessible Directories:**  Ensure the `.env` file is not located within the web server's document root.
    - **Secrets Management for Production:**  For production environments, utilize more robust secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) instead of relying solely on `.env` files.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of the `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_the___env__file.md)

- **Description:** Malicious actors gain the ability to modify the contents of the `.env` file.
- **How `dotenv` Contributes:** `dotenv` directly reads and uses the values from this file. If the file is compromised, the application will load and use the attacker's injected values.
- **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the server hosting the application and modifies the `.env` file to inject a malicious database connection string.
- **Impact:** Introduction of malicious configurations, potential for remote code execution if environment variables are used in insecure ways, data breaches, or denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Restrict File System Access:** Implement strong access controls on the server and directories containing the `.env` file.
    - **Immutable Infrastructure:** In containerized environments, consider using immutable infrastructure where the `.env` file is injected at runtime and the base image is read-only.
    - **Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to the `.env` file.
