# Attack Surface Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via___env__file.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets, is stored in plain text within the `.env` file.

**How dotenv Contributes:** `dotenv`'s primary function is to load these values from the `.env` file into the application's environment, making them accessible to the application. If the `.env` file is exposed, the secrets are directly compromised.

**Example:** A developer accidentally commits the `.env` file to a public Git repository. An attacker finds the repository and gains access to all the secrets within the file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never commit `.env` files to version control.** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
*   **Use secure methods for managing secrets in production environments**, such as dedicated secret management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
*   **Implement proper file permissions** on the `.env` file to restrict access to only the necessary users and processes.
*   **Consider using environment variable injection** directly by the hosting environment or orchestration tools in production, avoiding the need for a `.env` file in those environments.

## Attack Surface: [Modification of `.env` File Leading to Configuration Tampering](./attack_surfaces/modification_of___env__file_leading_to_configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `.env` file and modifies its contents, altering the application's configuration.

**How dotenv Contributes:** `dotenv` reads and applies the values from the `.env` file. If an attacker can modify this file, they can inject malicious values that the application will then use.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting the application and modifies the `.env` file to change the database connection string to point to a malicious database under their control.

**Impact:** Code injection, data manipulation, redirection to malicious services, denial of service, privilege escalation (depending on the variables modified).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement strict file permissions** on the `.env` file, ensuring only the application owner or necessary system accounts have write access.
*   **Monitor file integrity** of the `.env` file to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   **Consider making the `.env` file immutable** in production environments after initial setup.
*   **Avoid storing sensitive configuration directly in `.env`** if possible, opting for more secure configuration management methods.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `dotenv` library itself or one of its dependencies could be compromised, leading to the injection of malicious code.

**How dotenv Contributes:** The application relies on `dotenv` to load environment variables. If `dotenv` is compromised, the malicious code could be executed during this loading process.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the `dotenv` repository or a dependency's repository and injects malicious code that, for example, exfiltrates environment variables or executes arbitrary commands when the library is used.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, backdoors, and other severe security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly audit and update dependencies** to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Use dependency scanning tools** to identify potential security issues in your dependencies.
*   **Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to track and manage open-source components.
*   **Consider using dependency pinning or lock files** to ensure consistent versions of dependencies are used.

## Attack Surface: [Overwriting Existing Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/overwriting_existing_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** `dotenv` overwrites existing environment variables with values from the `.env` file. If an attacker can control the contents of the `.env` file, they could potentially overwrite critical system environment variables.

**How dotenv Contributes:** This is the default behavior of `dotenv`. It prioritizes the values in the `.env` file.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `.env` file to set a critical system environment variable like `PATH` to a malicious value. When the application runs, it might use this modified `PATH`, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled binaries.

**Impact:** System instability, privilege escalation, execution of malicious code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Be mindful of the environment variables you define in `.env`** and avoid naming them the same as critical system environment variables.
*   **Consider using a prefix for your application-specific environment variables** to avoid naming conflicts.
*   **In production environments, rely on environment variable injection by the hosting platform** rather than a `.env` file, giving more control over the environment.
