# Threat Model Analysis for bkeepers/dotenv

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of `.env` in Version Control](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of___env__in_version_control.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to a version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) that inadvertently contains the `.env` file. The attacker can then clone the repository and extract sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets that `dotenv` is intended to load into the application's environment.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of sensitive credentials that the application relies on, leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, and potentially the application itself. This can result in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* **Affected Component:** `.env` file (content that `dotenv` reads)
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Always include `.env` in the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
    * Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically check for and prevent the commit of `.env` files.
    * Regularly audit repositories for accidentally committed sensitive data using tools designed for this purpose.
    * Educate developers on the risks of committing sensitive files.
    * Consider using secrets management solutions instead of relying solely on `.env` files, especially for production environments.

## Threat: [Exposure of `.env` File on Production Server](./threats/exposure_of___env__file_on_production_server.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration on the production web server (e.g., directory listing enabled, incorrect file permissions) to directly access and read the contents of the `.env` file. This allows the attacker to see the sensitive environment variables that `dotenv` is configured to load.
* **Impact:** Similar to the previous threat, this leads to the exposure of sensitive credentials that the application uses, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the application's backend systems, databases, and connected services.
* **Affected Component:** `.env` file (storage location that `dotenv` reads from)
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure the web server is configured to prevent direct access to the `.env` file.
    * Set restrictive file permissions on the `.env` file, allowing only the application user to read it.
    * Avoid deploying the `.env` file to production environments. Instead, use environment variables set directly on the server or a dedicated secrets management system.

## Threat: [Insecure File Permissions Leading to Modification](./threats/insecure_file_permissions_leading_to_modification.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server and exploits overly permissive file permissions on the `.env` file to modify its contents. They could inject malicious credentials or alter existing ones that `dotenv` will then load into the application's environment.
* **Impact:** Compromise of application security, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access, and denial of service. The attacker could effectively backdoor the application by manipulating the configuration that `dotenv` provides.
* **Affected Component:** `.env` file (content that `dotenv` reads and loads)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict file permissions on the `.env` file, ensuring only the application user has read and write access.
    * Regularly audit file permissions on sensitive configuration files.
    * Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where configuration files are read-only after deployment.

## Threat: [Exposure through Backup Processes](./threats/exposure_through_backup_processes.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to insecurely stored backups of the application or server that contain the `.env` file. This allows them to access the sensitive environment variables that `dotenv` manages. This could occur if backups are stored without encryption or with weak access controls.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials that the application relies on, potentially leading to the same consequences as direct access to the `.env` file on the server. The impact depends on the scope and sensitivity of the data within the `.env` file.
* **Affected Component:** `.env` file (content within backups that `dotenv` would load)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong encryption for all application and server backups.
    * Securely store backup media and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
    * Consider excluding the `.env` file from backups or using a separate, more secure method for backing up sensitive configuration data.

## Threat: [Overriding Existing Environment Variables with Malicious Values](./threats/overriding_existing_environment_variables_with_malicious_values.md)

* **Description:** While `dotenv` primarily loads from the `.env` file, if the application logic or other configuration mechanisms allow for overriding these values *after* `dotenv` has loaded them, an attacker who can manipulate the environment (e.g., on a compromised server) could inject malicious values that take precedence over the intended settings loaded by `dotenv`.
* **Impact:** The attacker could manipulate application behavior, redirect traffic, or escalate privileges by injecting malicious configuration values that the application trusts because they appear to be part of its environment.
* **Affected Component:** `dotenv` module (initial loading of variables, potential for later overrides), application's environment variable handling logic.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully consider the order in which environment variables are loaded and prioritized within the application.
    * Implement validation and sanitization of environment variables before using them in critical operations, even if they are loaded by `dotenv`.
    * Restrict access to the server environment to prevent unauthorized modification of environment variables.
