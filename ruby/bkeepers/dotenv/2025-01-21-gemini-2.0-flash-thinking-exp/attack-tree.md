## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Read Contents of .env File](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_read_contents_of__env_file.md)

*   This node represents the successful retrieval of the `.env` file's contents by the attacker. Achieving this immediately exposes all sensitive information stored within, such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. This is a critical point of compromise as it grants the attacker significant access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Direct File Access to Read .env File](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_direct_file_access_to_read__env_file.md)

*   This path involves directly accessing the `.env` file through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerability in Application:** Attackers exploit flaws in the application's handling of file paths (e.g., in file upload or download functionalities) to navigate the file system and access the `.env` file using crafted paths like `../../.env`. This is a common web application vulnerability that, if present, provides a direct route to the sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure Leading to .env File Access](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_leading_to__env_file_access.md)

*   This path involves indirectly gaining access to the `.env` file by first obtaining information about its location.
    *   **Error Messages Exposing File Paths:**  Poorly configured applications might inadvertently reveal the full path of the `.env` file in error messages displayed to users or logged in accessible locations. This information can then be used to target the file for direct access attempts.
    *   **Exposed Git Repository:** If the `.env` file is mistakenly committed to a public or accessible Git repository (and not properly excluded using `.gitignore`), attackers can easily clone the repository and retrieve the file. This is a common oversight, especially in early stages of development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Modify .env File Contents](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_modify__env_file_contents.md)

*   This node signifies the attacker's ability to write to and alter the contents of the `.env` file. Achieving this grants the attacker the power to inject malicious environment variables, overwrite existing ones with harmful values, or completely replace the file. This level of control over the application's environment can lead to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Modifying .env File Contents](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_modifying__env_file_contents.md)

*   This path focuses on the methods an attacker might use to gain write access to the `.env` file and subsequently modify its contents.
    *   **Application Vulnerability Allowing File Write:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the application that allow arbitrary file writing. This could involve flaws in file upload functionalities, insecure deserialization, or other vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to overwrite the `.env` file with malicious content.
    *   **Misconfigured Permissions:** If the `.env` file has overly permissive write permissions (e.g., world-writable or writable by the web server user), an attacker who has gained some level of access to the server (even if not root) can directly modify the file. This is a common misconfiguration that can have severe consequences.
