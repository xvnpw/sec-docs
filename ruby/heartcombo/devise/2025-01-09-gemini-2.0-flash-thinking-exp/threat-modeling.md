# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Threat: [Brute-force Attack Against Login Form](./threats/brute-force_attack_against_login_form.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a user account by repeatedly trying different password combinations against the login form. This can be automated using scripts or tools.

**Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to account takeover, allowing attackers to access sensitive user data, perform actions on behalf of the user, or disrupt the application.

**Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::SessionsController`, specifically the `create` action.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts (Devise's `config.maximum_attempts`), enable account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts (Devise's `Lockable` module), consider using CAPTCHA or similar challenges, enforce strong password policies.

## Threat: [Credential Stuffing Attack](./threats/credential_stuffing_attack.md)

**Description:** Attackers use lists of compromised username/password pairs obtained from other data breaches to attempt logins on the application. They rely on users reusing credentials across multiple services.

**Impact:** Successful credential stuffing leads to unauthorized account access, similar to brute-force attacks, potentially affecting a large number of users.

**Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::SessionsController`, specifically the `create` action.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Monitor for suspicious login patterns and IP addresses. Consider using a password breach detection service.

## Threat: [Password Reset Vulnerability (Weak Token Generation)](./threats/password_reset_vulnerability__weak_token_generation_.md)

**Description:** If the password reset token generated by Devise is predictable or easily guessable, an attacker could potentially forge a valid reset token for another user's account.

**Impact:** Account takeover by the attacker, allowing them to change the victim's password and gain full access to their account.

**Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::PasswordsController`, specifically the token generation process within the `Recoverable` module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure you are using a reasonably recent version of Devise where token generation is cryptographically secure. Avoid any custom modifications to the token generation process that might weaken it.

## Threat: [Password Reset Vulnerability (Insecure Delivery of Reset Link)](./threats/password_reset_vulnerability__insecure_delivery_of_reset_link_.md)

**Description:** If the password reset link is transmitted insecurely (e.g., over unencrypted HTTP), an attacker intercepting the communication could gain access to the reset link.

**Impact:** Account takeover by the attacker who can use the intercepted link to reset the victim's password.

**Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::PasswordsController`, specifically the email sending functionality within the `Recoverable` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce HTTPS for the entire application. Ensure the email sending mechanism is secure and doesn't expose the reset token in insecure ways.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.

**Impact:** Account takeover by the attacker who can then perform actions as the legitimate user.

**Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::SessionsController`, specifically the session management logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Devise regenerates session IDs on login by default. Ensure this default behavior is not overridden. Avoid exposing session IDs in URLs.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Storage (Configuration Issue)](./threats/insecure_password_storage__configuration_issue_.md)

**Description:** If the application is configured to use a weak hashing algorithm for storing passwords (instead of the default `bcrypt`), it becomes easier for attackers to crack passwords if the database is compromised.

**Impact:** Mass compromise of user accounts if the password database is leaked.

**Devise Component Affected:** Password hashing configuration within Devise's initializers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure Devise is configured to use a strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` (which is the default). Avoid custom password hashing implementations unless absolutely necessary and with expert review.
