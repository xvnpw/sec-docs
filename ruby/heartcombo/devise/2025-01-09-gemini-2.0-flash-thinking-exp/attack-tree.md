## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** This represents the overarching goal of bypassing the intended authentication mechanisms provided by Devise. Success here directly leads to unauthorized access.
*   **Why Critical:** Achieving this goal allows an attacker to completely circumvent security measures and gain control of user accounts. It's a fundamental breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass -> Weak Password Reset Mechanism -> Predictable Password Reset Token -> Obtain Reset Token](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authentication_bypass_-_weak_password_reset_mechanism_-_predictable_password__4b600696.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Weak Password Reset Mechanism:** The application utilizes a flawed password reset process within Devise.
    *   **Predictable Password Reset Token:** The password reset tokens generated by Devise are not sufficiently random or are based on predictable patterns.
    *   **Obtain Reset Token:** An attacker manages to acquire a valid password reset token for a target user. This could be through various means:
        *   **Sniffing Network Traffic:** Intercepting the reset token sent via email or a web request (especially if HTTPS is not enforced or incorrectly configured).
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into revealing the reset link or token.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium (Predictable tokens are a known vulnerability, though modern Devise versions have improved).
    *   Impact: Critical (Account Takeover).
    *   Effort: Low.
    *   Skill Level: Beginner.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult (Generating and using a valid token might not be easily distinguishable from legitimate activity).
*   **Why High-Risk:** The combination of a critical impact (account takeover) with a moderate likelihood and low effort makes this a significant threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass -> Weak Password Reset Mechanism -> Lack of Rate Limiting on Reset Attempts -> Repeatedly Request Reset Tokens](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authentication_bypass_-_weak_password_reset_mechanism_-_lack_of_rate_limiting_10a8e68b.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Weak Password Reset Mechanism:** The application's password reset process lacks proper rate limiting.
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting on Reset Attempts:** There are no effective controls to limit the number of password reset requests from a single IP address or for a specific user account within a given timeframe.
    *   **Repeatedly Request Reset Tokens:** The attacker automates the process of requesting password reset tokens for a target user.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: High (Lack of rate limiting is a common oversight).
    *   Impact: Moderate (Account Lockout, Email Flooding - can lead to denial of service for the user).
    *   Effort: Minimal.
    *   Skill Level: Novice.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (A large number of reset requests from the same source is a clear indicator).
*   **Why High-Risk:** While the immediate impact is moderate (account lockout), this can be a precursor to other attacks or cause significant disruption for the targeted user. The high likelihood and minimal effort make it a readily exploitable vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Weak Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_weak_password_reset_mechanism.md)

**Description:**  A fundamental flaw in the design or implementation of the password reset functionality.
*   **Why Critical:** This weakness can be exploited in multiple ways (predictable tokens, lack of rate limiting) to compromise user accounts. It's a direct path to authentication bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass -> Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality -> Theft of "Remember Me" Token -> Access User's Browser Storage/Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authentication_bypass_-_insecure_remember_me_functionality_-_theft_of_remembe_4fe9d76a.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality:** The "remember me" feature in Devise is not implemented securely.
    *   **Theft of "Remember Me" Token:** The attacker manages to steal the "remember me" token stored in the user's browser. This often involves exploiting other vulnerabilities:
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the application that can steal cookies, including the "remember me" token.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting network traffic to capture the token if HTTPS is not properly enforced.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium (Relies on the presence of other vulnerabilities like XSS).
    *   Impact: Critical (Account Takeover).
    *   Effort: Moderate (Requires exploiting another vulnerability).
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult (Stealing the token might not leave immediate traces on the server-side).
*   **Why High-Risk:** Although it often requires another vulnerability, the critical impact of account takeover makes this a significant threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass -> Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality -> Replay of "Remember Me" Token -> Use Stolen Token on Another Device/Browser](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authentication_bypass_-_insecure_remember_me_functionality_-_replay_of_rememb_d71a3a02.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality:** The "remember me" token, once obtained, can be used indefinitely or is not tied to specific devices/browsers.
    *   **Replay of "Remember Me" Token:** The attacker uses a previously stolen "remember me" token to gain unauthorized access from a different device or browser.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium (If the token is not properly invalidated or tied to specific sessions).
    *   Impact: Critical (Account Takeover).
    *   Effort: Low (Once the token is obtained).
    *   Skill Level: Beginner.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Detecting unauthorized use of a valid token can be challenging).
*   **Why High-Risk:**  The critical impact and the potential for prolonged unauthorized access make this a serious concern, even if the initial token theft requires more effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_remember_me_functionality.md)

**Description:** A weakness in how the "remember me" feature is implemented, making the tokens susceptible to theft or replay.
*   **Why Critical:**  Compromising this functionality provides a persistent way for attackers to gain unauthorized access, even if the user changes their password (if the token invalidation is not implemented correctly).
