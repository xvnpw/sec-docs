# Attack Surface Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force Attacks on Login](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different username and password combinations.
*   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise provides the core authentication logic, and without proper rate limiting or lockout mechanisms, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a script to repeatedly submit login requests with various common passwords for a known username.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, potential data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts (e.g., using `rack-attack` or similar gems).
    *   Enable Devise's built-in `lockable` module to temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Vulnerabilities (Insecure Token Generation)](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_vulnerabilities__insecure_token_generation_.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or predictable password reset tokens allow attackers to reset other users' passwords.
*   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise generates password reset tokens. If the generation process is flawed or uses weak entropy, tokens can be guessed or predicted.
*   **Example:** An attacker analyzes the format and structure of password reset tokens and identifies a pattern, allowing them to generate valid tokens for other users.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Devise's `reset_password_token` is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    *   Review and customize Devise's password reset token generation if necessary.
    *   Set a reasonable expiration time for password reset tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session.
*   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise manages user sessions. If not configured correctly, it might be vulnerable to session fixation.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link containing a specific session ID and tricks a user into clicking it. After the user logs in, the attacker can use the same session ID to access the user's account.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Devise regenerates the session ID upon successful login.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Devise Controllers or Views](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_devise_controllers_or_views.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws can be introduced when developers customize Devise's default behavior in controllers or views.
*   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise provides a framework that developers can extend. Incorrect or insecure customizations can create new attack vectors.
*   **Example:** A developer adds a custom registration controller that doesn't properly sanitize user input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the flaw, including XSS, CSRF, or authorization bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be high or critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when customizing Devise.
    *   Thoroughly review and test any custom code.
    *   Be aware of common web application vulnerabilities when implementing custom logic.
