## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized Access to User Accounts or Application Functionality via Devise]]](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_access_to_user_accounts_or_application_functionality_via_devise__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching objective of the attacker.  It represents the successful compromise of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to Devise.
*   **Likelihood:** High (given the prevalence of attacks targeting authentication systems)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete loss of control over user accounts and potentially the entire application)
*   **Effort:** Variable (depends on the specific vulnerabilities present)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (depends on the complexity of the exploit)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (depends on the sophistication of the attack and the application's monitoring capabilities)

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [[Compromise User Accounts]]](./attack_tree_paths/=___compromise_user_accounts__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most direct path to unauthorized access, focusing on gaining control of existing user accounts.
*   **Likelihood:** High (common attack vector)
*   **Impact:** High (loss of control over user accounts)
*   **Effort:** Variable (depends on the chosen attack method)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [Brute-Force Password]](./attack_tree_paths/=__brute-force_password_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to guess user passwords by systematically trying many combinations.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if weak password policies are in place)
*   **Impact:** High (full account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through failed login attempts, but can be obfuscated)
*   **-> [Weak/Default Passwords]:**  This significantly increases the likelihood of success for brute-force attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [Credential Stuffing (Devise)]](./attack_tree_paths/=__credential_stuffing__devise__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use lists of stolen credentials (username/password pairs) from other breaches, assuming users reuse passwords.
*   **Likelihood:** High (very common attack)
*   **Impact:** High (full account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools and credential lists readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through spikes in login attempts, but can be distributed)

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [Token Leakage/Theft]](./attack_tree_paths/=__token_leakagetheft_.md)

*   **Description:** This involves obtaining valid authentication tokens (JWTs or session cookies) to impersonate users.
*   **Likelihood:** Variable (depends on the presence of vulnerabilities that allow token exposure)
*   **Impact:** High (full account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Variable
*   **Skill Level:** Variable
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [[JWT Secret Key Leak]]](./attack_tree_paths/=___jwt_secret_key_leak__.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to the secret key used to sign JWTs. This is a catastrophic security failure.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if secrets are managed properly; *very high* if committed to version control)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete application compromise – attacker can forge any token)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if the key is exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (unless the attacker uses the compromised key in an obvious way)

## Attack Tree Path: [-> [Cookie Theft]](./attack_tree_paths/-__cookie_theft_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker steals a user's session cookie, typically through a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on presence of XSS vulnerabilities and user behavior)
*   **Impact:** High (full account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires exploiting an XSS vulnerability or social engineering)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through XSS detection and web application firewall logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [-> [Exploit Devise Configuration/Implementation]](./attack_tree_paths/-__exploit_devise_configurationimplementation_.md)

* **Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Devise is set up or used within the application.
* **Likelihood:** Variable
* **Impact:** Variable
* **Effort:** Variable
* **Skill Level:** Variable
* **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [=> [[Known CVEs in Used Version]]](./attack_tree_paths/=___known_cves_in_used_version__.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE) in the specific version of Devise being used.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if a CVE exists and the application is not patched)
*   **Impact:** Variable (depends on the specific CVE – could range from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on the complexity of the exploit – some CVEs have readily available exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High (depends on the complexity of the exploit)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (CVE information is publicly available; intrusion detection systems can often detect known exploits)
* **-> [Outdated Devise Version]:** Directly leads to the increased likelihood of Known CVE exploitation.
