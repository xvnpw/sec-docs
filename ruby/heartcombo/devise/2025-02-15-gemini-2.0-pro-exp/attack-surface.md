# Attack Surface Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks on Login](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_and_dictionary_attacks_on_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers repeatedly try different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Devise Contribution:** Devise provides the core authentication mechanism (`DatabaseAuthenticatable`), making it a direct target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords and attempts to log in to multiple user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data theft, data modification, potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
            *   Use Devise's `Lockable` module to lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
            *   Implement rate limiting to slow down login attempts from a single IP address.
            *   Consider CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms.
            *   Use a strong `pepper` and sufficient `stretches` in Devise configuration.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Use strong, unique passwords.
            *   Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if available (requires integration with Devise).

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Token Brute-Forcing/Prediction](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_token_brute-forcingprediction.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess or predict password reset tokens to gain control of user accounts.
    *   **Devise Contribution:** Devise's `Recoverable` module handles password reset functionality, generating and managing tokens.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a script to generate and test thousands of potential reset tokens against a known user account.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data theft, data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure Devise is configured to generate sufficiently long and cryptographically random reset tokens.
            *   Set a short expiration time for reset tokens.
            *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests.
            *   Use constant-time comparison methods when validating tokens.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious of suspicious emails and only click password reset links from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Session Hijacking/Fixation (related to `Rememberable`)](./attack_surfaces/session_hijackingfixation__related_to__rememberable__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers steal or manipulate session cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Devise Contribution:** Devise's `Rememberable` module uses cookies to maintain persistent login sessions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a user's "remember me" cookie over an insecure connection (HTTP) and uses it to access the user's account.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data theft, data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure Devise is configured to use secure cookies (HTTPS only, HTTPOnly flag).
            *   Properly regenerate session IDs after login to prevent session fixation.
            *   Consider implementing session expiration and inactivity timeouts.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks without a VPN.
            *   Log out of accounts when finished, especially on shared computers.

## Attack Surface: [OAuth-Related Attacks (via `Omniauthable`)](./attack_surfaces/oauth-related_attacks__via__omniauthable__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in OAuth providers or the application's OAuth integration.
    *   **Devise Contribution:** Devise's `Omniauthable` module facilitates integration with third-party OAuth providers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a compromised OAuth provider account to gain access to the application.  Or, an attacker manipulates the callback URL to redirect the user to a malicious site after authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data theft, data modification, potential for phishing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Carefully choose reputable OAuth providers.
            *   Validate the callback URL to prevent open redirects.
            *   Implement CSRF protection in the OAuth flow.
            *   Request only the necessary permissions (scopes) from the OAuth provider.
            *   Store OAuth tokens securely.
            *   Keep Omniauth and related gems updated.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious when granting permissions to applications via OAuth.
            *   Review the permissions requested by applications.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate user data (e.g., elevate privileges) by submitting unexpected parameters during registration or account updates.
    *   **Devise Contribution:** Devise interacts with the user model, making it susceptible if the model is not properly protected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds `admin=true` to the registration form data, attempting to create an administrator account.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized privilege escalation, data corruption, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use strong parameters (Rails >= 4) or `attr_accessible` (Rails < 4) to explicitly whitelist the attributes that can be modified through mass assignment.  *Never* trust user-provided input without proper sanitization and whitelisting.
        *   **Users:** No direct user mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites after sign-in/sign-out.
    * **Devise Contribution:** Devise uses redirects after sign-in/sign-out.
    * **Example:** Attacker crafts a URL with a malicious redirect parameter: `https://example.com/users/sign_in?redirect_to=https://evil.com`.
    * **Impact:** Phishing attacks, malware distribution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Validate and sanitize the `redirect_to` parameter.
            * Use a whitelist of allowed redirect URLs.
            * Avoid using user-supplied input directly in redirects.
        * **Users:**
            * Be cautious of suspicious URLs, especially those with unusual parameters.
