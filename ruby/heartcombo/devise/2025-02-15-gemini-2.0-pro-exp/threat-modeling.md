# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Threat: [Account Enumeration via Timing/Error Analysis](./threats/account_enumeration_via_timingerror_analysis.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends multiple requests to the login, registration, or password reset forms, varying the username/email. They analyze subtle differences in response times or error messages (e.g., "Invalid email or password" vs. "Email not found") to determine if an account exists.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can compile a list of valid usernames/emails, which can be used for targeted attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attempts.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** `Confirmable`, `Recoverable`, `Registerable`, and the core authentication logic. Specifically, the controller actions and views related to these modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consistent Response Times:** Implement a delay to ensure all responses (success or failure) take approximately the same time. This can be tricky to get right.
    *   **Generic Error Messages:** Use generic error messages that don't reveal whether the username/email exists (e.g., "Invalid login credentials").
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (e.g., with `rack-attack`) to slow down enumeration attempts.
    *   **CAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHAs on sensitive forms to deter automated attacks.
    *   **`config.paranoid = true`:** While not a complete solution, setting `config.paranoid = true` in `devise.rb` can help, but requires careful additional measures.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Login Attacks](./threats/brute-force_login_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses automated tools to systematically try a large number of password combinations against the login form.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionality.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** Core authentication logic (primarily the `SessionsController`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Account Lockout:** Use Devise's `Lockable` module to lock accounts after a configurable number of failed login attempts. Configure appropriate lockout duration and unlock mechanisms.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (e.g., with `rack-attack`) to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a time window.
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity, and potentially password history checks).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security.

## Threat: [Credential Stuffing](./threats/credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses lists of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from data breaches of other services) to attempt to log in to the application.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionality.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** Core authentication logic (primarily the `SessionsController`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Account Lockout:** Use Devise's `Lockable` module (as with brute-force attacks).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (as with brute-force attacks).
    *   **Password Reuse Prevention:** Ideally, integrate with a service that checks for compromised passwords (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API), though this has privacy implications. At a minimum, prevent users from reusing their *own* previous passwords.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA.
    *   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of password reuse and encourage them to use unique, strong passwords.

## Threat: [Weak Password Reset Token Generation/Handling](./threats/weak_password_reset_token_generationhandling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the password reset process, such as predictable tokens, insufficient token expiration, or vulnerabilities in the email delivery system, to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** `Recoverable` module. Specifically, the token generation, storage, and validation logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Token Generation:** Ensure Devise is using a cryptographically secure random number generator for reset tokens (this should be the default, but verify).
    *   **Short Token Expiration:** Set a short, reasonable expiration time for password reset tokens (e.g., 1 hour).
    *   **Secure Email Delivery:** Use a reputable email provider and secure SMTP settings. Monitor for email spoofing.
    *   **Token Invalidation:** Invalidate all active sessions and password reset tokens after a successful password reset.
    *   **Additional Verification:** Consider requiring additional verification during password reset (e.g., security questions â€“ but be aware of their limitations). Avoid sending the new password in the email.

## Threat: [Outdated Devise Gem](./threats/outdated_devise_gem.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of the Devise gem.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete account takeover.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** Potentially any module or part of Devise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if a known exploit exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Devise updated to the latest stable version.
    *   **Dependency Monitoring:** Use tools like `bundler-audit` or Dependabot to monitor for vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure `secret_key_base`](./threats/insecure__secret_key_base_.md)

*   **Description:** The Rails `secret_key_base` (used by Devise for cryptographic operations) is compromised (e.g., stored in version control, exposed in logs, or easily guessable).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can forge authentication tokens and gain unauthorized access to any account. This is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** All components that rely on cryptographic operations (which is most of them).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** **Never** store `secret_key_base` in version control.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution (e.g., Rails encrypted credentials, HashiCorp Vault) to store the secret key.
    *   **Regular Rotation:** Rotate the `secret_key_base` periodically.

## Threat: [Weak or Bypassed Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) *when integrated directly with Devise logic*](./threats/weak_or_bypassed_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__when_integrated_directly_with_devise_logic.md)

*   **Description:** If MFA is implemented *and the implementation directly hooks into or modifies Devise's core authentication flow*, an attacker finds a way to bypass it due to implementation flaws within that integration, weak token generation, or vulnerabilities in the MFA provider *as used within the Devise context*.  This is distinct from a general MFA bypass; it's about the *Devise-specific* integration.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, even with MFA enabled.
*   **Devise Component Affected:** The custom code integrating Devise with the MFA gem, potentially overriding Devise's `SessionsController` or other core methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reputable MFA Gem:** Use a well-vetted and actively maintained MFA gem.
    *   **Secure Integration:**  Follow the MFA gem's documentation *precisely*. Avoid unnecessary modifications to Devise's core logic.  If overriding Devise methods, ensure the overrides are secure and maintain Devise's security guarantees.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Test the *integrated* MFA and Devise flow extensively, including specific bypass attempts targeting the integration points.
    *   **Strong Token Generation:** Use strong, cryptographically secure random number generators for MFA tokens.
    *   **Hardware Tokens:** Consider using hardware-based MFA tokens (e.g., YubiKeys) for higher security.
