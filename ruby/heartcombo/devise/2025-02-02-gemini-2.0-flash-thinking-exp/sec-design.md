# BUSINESS POSTURE

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails applications based on Warden. It provides a complete MVC solution based on Rails engines. It is designed to be a complete authentication framework, offering features like user registration, login, password recovery, and session management.

Business priorities and goals for using Devise in a project are typically focused on:
- Securely managing user authentication and authorization.
- Reducing development time and effort for implementing authentication features.
- Providing a robust and well-tested authentication solution.
- Enabling user self-service features like registration and password management.
- Complying with security best practices for user authentication.

Most important business risks related to authentication and authorization that need to be addressed:
- Account Takeover: Unauthorized access to user accounts leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
- Data Breach: Exposure of sensitive user data, including credentials, due to vulnerabilities in authentication or session management.
- Service Disruption: Denial of service attacks targeting authentication endpoints, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
- Compliance Violations: Failure to meet regulatory requirements related to data protection and user authentication (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Reputational Damage: Loss of user trust and negative publicity resulting from security incidents related to authentication.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for projects using Devise:
- security control: Password hashing using bcrypt (Devise default). Implemented within Devise library.
- security control: Session management to maintain user login state. Implemented within Devise library and Rails framework.
- security control: Protection against common web attacks like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) through Rails framework. Implemented within Rails framework.
- security control: Input validation on user credentials and registration data. Implemented within application code using Devise helpers and Rails validations.
- security control: Protection against mass assignment vulnerabilities through Rails strong parameters. Implemented within application code using Rails strong parameters.

Accepted risks for projects using Devise:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying dependencies of Devise and Rails.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of Devise or Rails leading to security weaknesses.
- accepted risk: Implementation flaws in custom code extending or integrating with Devise.
- accepted risk: Brute-force attacks against login endpoints (mitigated by rate limiting, CAPTCHA, etc. - not default in Devise).
- accepted risk: Phishing attacks targeting user credentials (user education and multi-factor authentication are mitigations).

Recommended security controls to implement:
- security control: Implement rate limiting on login and registration endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks. Can be implemented using rack-attack or similar middleware.
- security control: Enforce strong password policies and password complexity requirements. Can be implemented using Devise configurations and custom validations.
- security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced account security. Can be implemented using Devise and gems like devise-two-factor.
- security control: Regularly update Devise and Rails to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implemented through dependency management practices.
- security control: Conduct security code reviews and penetration testing to identify and address potential security flaws in the application and Devise integration. Implemented as part of Secure Software Development Lifecycle.
- security control: Implement security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options) to protect against common web attacks. Implemented in web server configuration or Rails middleware.
- security control: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit. Implemented in web server and infrastructure configuration.

Security requirements for projects using Devise:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Securely authenticate users using username/email and password.
    - security requirement: Support for password recovery and reset mechanisms.
    - security requirement: Optional support for multi-factor authentication.
    - security requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
    - security requirement: Secure session management to maintain authenticated state.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Integrate with application authorization logic to control access to resources based on user roles or permissions. Devise provides user roles management, but application needs to implement authorization logic.
    - security requirement: Prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Validate all user inputs, especially during registration and login, to prevent injection attacks and data integrity issues.
    - security requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms for password hashing (bcrypt is default in Devise).
    - security requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys if used for features like remember-me tokens or encryption of sensitive data.
    - security requirement: Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and server.

Build Process Description:

The build process for Devise, as a Ruby gem, typically involves the following steps, focusing on security controls:

1. Developer makes code changes or updates dependencies and commits them to the Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. A CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically on code changes (e.g., via webhook) or on a schedule.
3. **Build Stage**:
    - Fetches code from the repository.
    - Installs dependencies.
    - Runs linters and code formatters to enforce code quality and consistency.
    - Performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. Tools like Brakeman for Ruby on Rails applications can be used.
    - Runs unit tests to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
4. **Test Stage**:
    - Runs integration tests to verify interactions between different components.
    - May include dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Tools like Bundler Audit or Dependabot can be used.
    - May include more comprehensive security testing, depending on the project's security posture.
5. **Publish Stage**:
    - If all tests and security checks pass, the pipeline proceeds to the publish stage.
    - Builds the gem package.
    - Signs the gem package with a private key for authenticity and integrity (if configured).
    - Publishes the gem package to a Package Registry (e.g., RubyGems.org). Secure credentials management for publishing is crucial.
6. **Rails Web Application Deployment**:
    - When a Rails application includes Devise as a dependency, it downloads the gem from the Package Registry during the application's build or deployment process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Devise:
- User Authentication: Verifying the identity of users attempting to access the application.
- User Authorization: Controlling access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
- Account Management: Securely managing user accounts, including registration, password management, and profile updates.
- Session Management: Maintaining user login sessions securely and preventing unauthorized access.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User Credentials (passwords): Highly sensitive. Must be securely hashed and protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.
- User Profile Information (email, username, etc.): Sensitive. Should be protected from unauthorized access and modification.
- Session Data: Sensitive. Contains information about authenticated user sessions and should be protected from hijacking and tampering.
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Sensitivity depends on the specific application and user data collected. Devise itself might handle PII depending on configured user attributes. Should be protected according to privacy regulations.
