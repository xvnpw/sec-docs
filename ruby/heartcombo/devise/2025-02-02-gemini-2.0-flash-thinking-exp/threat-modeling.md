# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Threat: [Insecure Password Storage](./threats/insecure_password_storage.md)

**Description:** Attacker gains access to the database containing user credentials. If password hashing is weak due to outdated libraries or misconfiguration within Devise's bcrypt integration, attackers can crack passwords offline using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
*   **Impact:** Mass account compromise, data breach, reputational damage.
*   **Devise Component:** `DatabaseAuthenticatable` module, bcrypt gem integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use latest stable versions of Ruby, bcrypt, and Devise.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider increasing bcrypt cost factor (carefully assess performance impact).
    *   Implement robust database security measures (encryption at rest, access control, regular backups).

## Threat: [Predictable Password Reset Tokens](./threats/predictable_password_reset_tokens.md)

**Description:** Attacker attempts to guess password reset tokens generated by Devise. If token generation within Devise's `Recoverable` module is not cryptographically secure or lacks sufficient entropy, attackers might succeed in predicting valid tokens for user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover via password reset, unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Devise Component:** `Recoverable` module, token generation mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Devise uses a cryptographically secure random number generator for token generation (verify default Devise behavior).
    *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent brute-force token guessing.
    *   Set short expiration times for password reset tokens.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Flow](./threats/insecure_password_reset_flow.md)

**Description:** Attacker intercepts or manipulates the password reset process managed by Devise's `Recoverable` module. This could involve intercepting reset links sent via insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted email), or exploiting vulnerabilities in the reset form or verification process to bypass security checks implemented by Devise.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover via password reset, unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Devise Component:** `Recoverable` module, password reset email functionality, reset password form.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for the entire password reset flow.
    *   Use secure email services and protocols (TLS encryption) for sending password reset emails.
    *   Implement CSRF protection for password reset forms (Devise default, verify).
    *   Consider additional verification steps if highly sensitive accounts are involved.

## Threat: [Session Fixation Vulnerabilities](./threats/session_fixation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attacker tricks a user into authenticating with a pre-determined session ID. If Devise fails to properly regenerate session IDs after successful login, a vulnerability in session management related to Devise and Rails, the attacker can hijack the user's session after they authenticate.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized actions performed as the victim user.
*   **Devise Component:** Session management within Devise and underlying Rails session handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Devise regenerates session IDs upon successful login (verify Devise configuration).
    *   Use secure session cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
    *   Implement proper session invalidation on logout.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attacks on Login](./threats/brute-force_attacks_on_login.md)

**Description:** Attacker attempts to guess user passwords by repeatedly submitting login requests through Devise's login form with different password combinations. Without proper protection mechanisms around Devise's authentication process, attackers can try a large number of passwords to compromise accounts.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise through password guessing, potential for widespread account takeover if weak passwords are common.
*   **Devise Component:** `DatabaseAuthenticatable` module, login form processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts based on IP address or username.
    *   Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated brute-force attacks after failed attempts.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts using Devise's `Lockable` module.
    *   Encourage users to use strong and unique passwords.
