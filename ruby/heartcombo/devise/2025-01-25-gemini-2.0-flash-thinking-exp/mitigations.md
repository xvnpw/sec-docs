# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Password Policies using Devise Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_password_policies_using_devise_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Utilize Devise's built-in `password_length` configuration in `config/initializers/devise.rb`. Set `config.password_length = 8..128` (or your desired range) to enforce a minimum and maximum password length for Devise user models.
    *   Step 2: Create a custom validator (e.g., `app/validators/password_complexity_validator.rb`) to enforce password complexity rules beyond length. This validator will check for criteria like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Step 3: Integrate the custom validator into your Devise User model (`app/models/user.rb`) using `validates :password, password_complexity: true, on: :create` and `validates :password, password_complexity: true, on: :update`. This ensures Devise uses the validator during user creation and password updates.
    *   Step 4: Modify Devise registration and edit views (`app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb`, `app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb`) to display password complexity requirements clearly to users, guiding them to create strong passwords that comply with Devise's enforced policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-force attacks (Severity: High) - Weak passwords, which Devise's password policies aim to prevent, are susceptible to brute-force attacks.
    *   Dictionary attacks (Severity: High) - Simple passwords, not compliant with strong policies enforced by Devise, are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
    *   Password guessing (Severity: Medium) - Predictable passwords, which Devise policies discourage, are easier to guess.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-force attacks: High reduction - Devise's strong password policies significantly increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks.
    *   Dictionary attacks: High reduction - Devise policies make dictionary attacks much less effective.
    *   Password guessing: Medium reduction - Devise policies reduce the likelihood of easily guessed passwords.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  (Example - Replace with your project's status) No

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Custom password complexity validator is not implemented. Devise's `password_length` might be at default or insufficient. User views lack clear password complexity guidance related to Devise's policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Login Attempts using Devise Security Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_login_attempts_using_devise_security_extensions.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate the `devise-security-extension` gem, specifically designed to enhance Devise security. Add `gem 'devise-security-extension'` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.
    *   Step 2: Configure rate limiting within the `devise-security-extension` initializer (usually created after installation).  Define rules to limit login attempts based on IP address or login name, leveraging Devise's authentication mechanisms. For example, limit attempts per minute or hour.
    *   Step 3: Customize the behavior of `devise-security-extension` for rate-limited requests.  Configure how Devise should respond to excessive login attempts, such as displaying a specific message or redirecting to a different page.
    *   Step 4: Monitor logs generated by `devise-security-extension` to track rate limiting events and identify potential brute-force attacks targeting Devise authentication.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-force attacks (Severity: High) - By limiting login attempts, `devise-security-extension` makes brute-force attacks against Devise logins significantly slower.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks (Severity: High) - `devise-security-extension` reduces the effectiveness of credential stuffing attacks targeting Devise authentication by limiting rapid attempts.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium) - `devise-security-extension` helps prevent login-related DoS attempts against Devise by controlling request frequency.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-force attacks: High reduction - `devise-security-extension` makes online brute-force attacks against Devise impractical.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks: High reduction - `devise-security-extension` greatly reduces the success rate of credential stuffing against Devise.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction - `devise-security-extension` mitigates login-based DoS attacks targeting Devise.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) No

*   **Missing Implementation:**  `devise-security-extension` gem is not installed. Rate limiting is not applied to Devise login attempts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Account Lockout after Failed Login Attempts using Devise Lockable Module](./mitigation_strategies/account_lockout_after_failed_login_attempts_using_devise_lockable_module.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable the `lockable` module in your Devise User model (`app/models/user.rb`) by including `:lockable` in the `devise` directive. This activates Devise's built-in account lockout functionality.
    *   Step 2: Configure lockout settings within `config/initializers/devise.rb`.  Use `config.maximum_attempts` to set the number of failed login attempts before Devise locks the account. Adjust `config.lock_strategy` and `config.unlock_strategy` as needed, leveraging Devise's lockout mechanisms.
    *   Step 3: Customize lockout messages in Devise locales (`config/locales/devise.en.yml`) to provide user-friendly instructions on unlocking their Devise accounts. Tailor these messages to align with Devise's lockout process (e.g., email unlock instructions if using `:email` unlock strategy).
    *   Step 4: Ensure your application's user interface gracefully handles locked Devise accounts. Display appropriate messages provided by Devise to locked-out users and guide them through the Devise-provided unlocking process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-force attacks (Severity: High) - Devise's `lockable` module automatically blocks accounts after failed attempts, stopping brute-force attacks targeting specific Devise accounts.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks (Severity: High) - Devise's lockout limits attempts against individual accounts, reducing credential stuffing success against Devise users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-force attacks: High reduction - Devise's `lockable` effectively stops brute-force attacks on individual Devise accounts.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks: High reduction - Devise's lockout significantly reduces credential stuffing success against individual Devise accounts.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, `lockable` module is enabled in User model.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Devise lockout settings in `devise.rb` are at default. Lockout messages in locales are not customized for Devise's lockout process. Review and adjust `maximum_attempts` and `unlock_strategy` in `devise.rb` and customize Devise-specific messages in `devise.en.yml`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Devise Two-Factor](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__with_devise_two-factor.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate the `devise-two-factor` gem, designed to add MFA to Devise. Add `gem 'devise-two-factor'` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.
    *   Step 2: Follow `devise-two-factor`'s documentation to configure MFA within your Devise User model and controllers. This involves adding the `:two_factor_authenticatable` module to your User model and running migrations provided by `devise-two-factor` to add necessary database columns for Devise MFA.
    *   Step 3: Implement MFA setup and verification flows in your application's UI, specifically for Devise users. This includes views for users to enable Devise MFA, generate and store Devise recovery codes, and enter their second factor during Devise login.
    *   Step 4: Configure Devise MFA methods offered by `devise-two-factor` (e.g., TOTP). Securely configure and manage these methods within the context of Devise authentication.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Account takeover (ATO) (Severity: High) - Even if Devise passwords are compromised, MFA via `devise-two-factor` adds a layer, making ATO of Devise accounts much harder.
    *   Password reuse attacks (Severity: High) - Devise MFA mitigates risks from password reuse across services, protecting Devise accounts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover (ATO): High reduction - Devise MFA dramatically reduces ATO risk for Devise accounts.
    *   Password reuse attacks: High reduction - Devise MFA makes password reuse attacks against Devise much less effective.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) No

*   **Missing Implementation:** `devise-two-factor` gem is not installed. Devise MFA functionality is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Session Timeout using Devise Timeoutable Module](./mitigation_strategies/session_timeout_using_devise_timeoutable_module.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable the `timeoutable` module in your Devise User model (`app/models/user.rb`) by including `:timeoutable` in the `devise` directive. This activates Devise's session timeout feature.
    *   Step 2: Configure session timeout duration in `config/initializers/devise.rb` using `config.timeout_in = 30.minutes` (or your desired duration). This sets a fixed session timeout for Devise sessions.
    *   Step 3: Customize Devise's timeout behavior and messages in locales (`config/locales/devise.en.yml`) if needed. Ensure Devise's timeout mechanism redirects users appropriately after session expiration.
    *   Step 4: Communicate Devise session timeout behavior to users, especially for sensitive applications using Devise for authentication.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session hijacking (Severity: Medium) - Devise's session timeout reduces the window for hijacking Devise sessions.
    *   Unauthorized access due to unattended sessions (Severity: Medium) - Devise's timeout automatically logs users out, preventing access if a Devise user leaves their session unattended.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Session hijacking: Medium reduction - Devise's timeout reduces the time window for successful hijacking of Devise sessions.
    *   Unauthorized access due to unattended sessions: Medium reduction - Devise's timeout mitigates risks from forgotten or unattended Devise sessions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, `timeoutable` module is enabled in User model.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Devise `timeout_in` setting in `devise.rb` might be at default or insufficient. Devise timeout messages in locales are not customized. Review and adjust `timeout_in` in `devise.rb` and customize Devise-specific messages in `devise.en.yml`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Password Reset Process using Devise Recoverable Module](./mitigation_strategies/secure_password_reset_process_using_devise_recoverable_module.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Rely on Devise's default password reset process provided by the `recoverable` module (ensure it's enabled in your User model). Devise's default process uses strong, time-limited tokens.
    *   Step 2: Implement rate limiting specifically for Devise password reset requests. Use `rack-attack` or similar to limit requests to Devise's password reset endpoint based on IP or email, preventing abuse of Devise's password recovery feature.
    *   Step 3: Customize Devise password reset emails (`app/views/devise/mailer/reset_password_instructions.html.erb`) to include clear security warnings and instructions, guiding users through Devise's password reset process and preventing phishing attempts targeting Devise users.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Account takeover via password reset abuse (Severity: High) - Weak password reset processes, which Devise's `recoverable` module aims to prevent, can be exploited for ATO.
    *   Account enumeration (Severity: Medium) - Attackers might try to enumerate valid emails via Devise's password reset. Rate limiting Devise reset requests mitigates this.
    *   Phishing attacks targeting password reset (Severity: Medium) - Users might be tricked by fake password reset emails mimicking Devise's process. Clear Devise email templates help prevent this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover via password reset abuse: High reduction - Devise's `recoverable` module and secure configuration make abuse much harder.
    *   Account enumeration: Medium reduction - Rate limiting Devise reset requests hinders enumeration attempts.
    *   Phishing attacks targeting password reset: Medium reduction - Clear Devise email templates help users identify legitimate Devise password resets.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, Devise default password reset process via `recoverable` is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting for Devise password reset requests is not implemented. Devise password reset email template is not customized for enhanced security guidance. Consider implementing rate limiting for Devise password reset and customizing the Devise email template.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Email Verification for Registration using Devise Confirmable Module](./mitigation_strategies/email_verification_for_registration_using_devise_confirmable_module.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable the `confirmable` module in your Devise User model (`app/models/user.rb`) by including `:confirmable` in the `devise` directive. This activates Devise's email verification feature for registration.
    *   Step 2: Configure email confirmation settings in `config/initializers/devise.rb` related to Devise's `confirmable` module, such as `config.reconfirmable = true` if re-verification is needed after email changes within Devise.
    *   Step 3: Customize email confirmation messages in Devise locales (`config/locales/devise.en.yml`) and email templates (`app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb`). Tailor these to clearly guide users through Devise's email confirmation process.
    *   Step 4: Ensure users are not automatically logged in after Devise registration until their email is verified through Devise's confirmation process. The `confirmable` module handles this by default within Devise.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Spam registrations (Severity: Low) - Devise's `confirmable` module prevents registration with fake emails, reducing spam accounts within Devise user base.
    *   Account creation with stolen/misused emails (Severity: Medium) - Devise's email verification confirms email ownership during Devise registration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Spam registrations: Medium reduction - Devise's `confirmable` significantly reduces spam registrations within Devise.
    *   Account creation with stolen/misused emails: Medium reduction - Devise's verification adds a layer to prevent unauthorized Devise account creation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, `confirmable` module is enabled in User model.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Devise email confirmation settings in `devise.rb` are at default. Confirmation messages in locales and email templates are not customized for Devise's process. Review and adjust `reconfirmable` in `devise.rb` and customize Devise-specific messages in `devise.en.yml` and email templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Devise Modules in User Model](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_devise_modules_in_user_model.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your Devise User model (`app/models/user.rb`) and identify Devise modules (e.g., `:confirmable`, `:lockable`, `:timeoutable`, `:recoverable`, `:rememberable`, `:trackable`, `:validatable`, `:registerable`) that are not actively used by your application's Devise authentication system.
    *   Step 2: Remove or comment out any identified unused Devise modules from the `devise` directive in your User model. For example, if email confirmation is not used, remove `:confirmable`.
    *   Step 3: Periodically review your application's features and Devise module usage to ensure only the necessary Devise modules remain enabled, minimizing the attack surface related to Devise.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Reduced attack surface (Severity: Low) - Disabling unused Devise modules reduces the potential attack surface by removing unnecessary Devise code and functionalities that could have vulnerabilities.
    *   Code complexity reduction (Severity: Low) - Simplifying the Devise configuration by removing unused modules can make the codebase easier to maintain and audit for Devise-related security issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduced attack surface: Low reduction - Minimally reduces the attack surface related to Devise.
    *   Code complexity reduction: Low reduction - Slightly simplifies Devise configuration and related code.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, only necessary Devise modules are enabled in User model.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Fully Implemented (assuming only necessary Devise modules are enabled). Periodically review enabled Devise modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Devise Gem and Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_devise_gem_and_dependencies_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly check for updates specifically for the `devise` gem and its direct dependencies listed in your `Gemfile`.
    *   Step 2: Use `bundle outdated devise` to specifically check for outdated versions of the `devise` gem.
    *   Step 3: Update the `devise` gem using `bundle update devise`.
    *   Step 4: Monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for the `devise` gem to stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities within Devise and apply updates promptly to patch them.
    *   Step 5: After updating the `devise` gem, thoroughly test your application's Devise authentication flows to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced in Devise-related functionalities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known Devise vulnerabilities (Severity: High) - Outdated Devise versions may contain known security flaws that attackers can exploit. Updating Devise patches these.
    *   Zero-day exploits in Devise (Severity: Medium) - While updates don't prevent zero-days, staying updated allows for faster patching when Devise-specific zero-days are discovered.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known Devise vulnerabilities: High reduction - Patching known Devise vulnerabilities significantly reduces the risk of exploitation.
    *   Zero-day exploits in Devise: Medium reduction - Reduces the window of vulnerability to Devise-specific zero-day attacks and enables faster patching.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status) Yes, dependency update process is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Fully Implemented (assuming regular Devise updates are performed). Regularly check for and apply Devise updates.
