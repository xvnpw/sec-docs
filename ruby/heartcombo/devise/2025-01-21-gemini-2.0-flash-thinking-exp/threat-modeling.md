# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Login](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_login.md)

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attack on Login
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly submitting different username/password combinations through the login form provided by Devise. They might use automated tools to try thousands or millions of combinations, exploiting the default lack of aggressive rate limiting in Devise.
    *   **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially resulting in data breaches, account manipulation, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::SessionsController` (specifically the `create` action).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts (e.g., using Rack Attack or similar gems) to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a specific timeframe.
        *   Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts to temporarily prevent further attempts from a specific user.
        *   Consider using CAPTCHA or similar challenges after multiple failed attempts to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

## Threat: [Predictable Password Reset Token](./threats/predictable_password_reset_token.md)

*   **Threat:** Predictable Password Reset Token
    *   **Description:** If the password reset token generated by Devise is predictable or easily guessable due to a weak random number generator or flawed implementation within Devise, an attacker can request a password reset for a target user and then predict the token. This allows them to bypass the intended user and set a new password without legitimate access.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover.
    *   **Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::Models::Recoverable` (specifically the token generation logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Devise's `reset_password_token` is generated using a cryptographically secure random function. This is generally the case with modern versions of Devise, but it's crucial to verify and keep Devise updated.
        *   Regularly review and update Devise to benefit from security patches that address potential weaknesses in token generation.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Threat:** Session Fixation
    *   **Description:** An attacker can trick a user into using a session ID that the attacker controls. This can be done by sending the user a link with a predefined session ID. If Devise's session management is not properly configured (or if using an older version with known vulnerabilities), it might not regenerate the session ID upon login, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they successfully authenticate.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover.
    *   **Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::SessionsController` (specifically session management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Devise regenerates the session ID upon successful login. This is generally the default behavior in recent versions, but it's important to verify your configuration.
        *   Set the `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on session cookies to prevent JavaScript access and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.

## Threat: [Insecure "Remember Me" Token Handling](./threats/insecure_remember_me_token_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure "Remember Me" Token Handling
    *   **Description:** If the "remember me" functionality provided by Devise is enabled, but the tokens are stored insecurely (e.g., without proper hashing or encryption in the database) or are not invalidated upon password change or logout, an attacker who gains access to the user's browser or computer can potentially extract and reuse the token to bypass the login process.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Devise Component Affected:** `Devise::Models::Rememberable` (specifically token generation and persistence).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure "remember me" tokens are stored securely in the database using a strong hashing algorithm (Devise uses `BCrypt` by default, which is good, but verify your configuration).
        *   Invalidate "remember me" tokens upon password change, logout, or account compromise to prevent their reuse.
        *   Consider using a shorter expiration time for "remember me" tokens to limit the window of opportunity for exploitation.

## Threat: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass (If Enabled via Devise Extensions)](./threats/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__bypass__if_enabled_via_devise_extensions_.md)

*   **Threat:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass (If Enabled via Devise Extensions)
    *   **Description:** If MFA is enabled through Devise's extensions or other integrations, vulnerabilities within the Devise extension itself or its interaction with Devise's core authentication flow could allow attackers to bypass the second factor. This might involve flaws in how MFA status is tracked or enforced within the Devise authentication process.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover despite MFA being enabled.
    *   **Devise Component Affected:** Depends on the specific Devise MFA extension being used (e.g., `Devise::Models::TwoFactorAuthenticatable` if using a Devise extension).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Choose reputable and well-maintained Devise MFA extensions.
        *   Thoroughly review the security of the chosen MFA extension and its integration with Devise.
        *   Ensure MFA is enforced for all critical actions and that there are no bypass mechanisms within the Devise authentication flow.
        *   Keep the Devise gem and its MFA extensions updated to benefit from the latest security patches.
