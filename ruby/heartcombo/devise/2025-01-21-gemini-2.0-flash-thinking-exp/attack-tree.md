## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses via Brute-Force](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_authentication_weaknesses_via_brute-force.md)

* **Compromise Application (via Devise):** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (Critical Node):** The attacker targets the core authentication mechanisms provided by Devise.
* **Brute-force Login Credentials (High-Risk Path Node):** The attacker attempts to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations.
* **Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting (Critical Node):**  The application fails to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP or user, allowing the attacker to perform a brute-force attack effectively.
    * **Attack Vector:** Automated tools are used to send a large number of login requests with different username/password combinations. Without rate limiting, the attacker can try many possibilities quickly.
    * **Impact:** Successful compromise of user accounts.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts based on IP address and/or username. Consider using CAPTCHA or account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses via Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_authentication_weaknesses_via_credential_stuffing.md)

* **Compromise Application (via Devise):** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (Critical Node):** The attacker targets the core authentication mechanisms provided by Devise.
* **Credential Stuffing (High-Risk Path Node):** The attacker uses lists of known username/password pairs (often obtained from previous data breaches) to attempt logins.
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage compromised credentials from other services, hoping users reuse passwords. Automated tools are used to test these credential lists against the application's login form.
    * **Impact:** Successful compromise of user accounts where users have reused passwords.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate credential stuffing attacks, such as monitoring for unusual login patterns, using CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts, and encouraging users to use strong, unique passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses by Bypassing MFA](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_authentication_weaknesses_by_bypassing_mfa.md)

* **Compromise Application (via Devise):** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (Critical Node):** The attacker targets the core authentication mechanisms provided by Devise.
* **Bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (If Enabled) (Critical Node):** The attacker attempts to circumvent the additional security layer of MFA.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in MFA Implementation (Application-Specific):** Flaws in how MFA is integrated or implemented can be exploited.
            * **Impact:** Account compromise despite MFA being enabled.
            * **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test any custom MFA implementation. Follow security best practices for MFA implementation.
        * **Social Engineering to Obtain MFA Token:** Tricking the user into providing their MFA code.
            * **Impact:** Account compromise despite MFA being enabled.
            * **Mitigation:** Educate users about phishing and social engineering tactics. Implement phishing-resistant MFA methods where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploiting Password Reset Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploiting_password_reset_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Compromise Application (via Devise):** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Password Reset Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** The attacker targets the password reset functionality provided by Devise.
* **Password Reset Token Manipulation (High-Risk Path Node):** The attacker attempts to manipulate the password reset token to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Predictable Reset Tokens (Critical Node):** The password reset tokens are generated using a predictable algorithm, allowing attackers to guess valid tokens.
        * **Attack Vector:** If the reset token generation is predictable, attackers can generate potential valid tokens for a user and use them to reset the password.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover.
        * **Mitigation:** Use cryptographically secure random token generation for password reset links. Ensure tokens are long and unpredictable.
* **Account Takeover via Password Reset (High-Risk Path Node):** The attacker successfully resets the password of a target account without proper authorization.
    * **Lack of Email Verification Before Reset (Critical Node):** The application does not verify the user's email address before allowing a password reset, allowing an attacker to reset the password for any email address.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker can initiate a password reset for a target user's email address and, since no email verification is required, successfully change the password and gain access to the account.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover.
        * **Mitigation:** Always verify the user's email address before allowing a password reset. Send a confirmation link to the user's registered email address.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Exploiting Session Management Weaknesses via Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_exploiting_session_management_weaknesses_via_session_hijacking.md)

* **Compromise Application (via Devise):** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Session Management Weaknesses (Critical Node):** The attacker targets how user sessions are managed by Devise and the application.
* **Session Hijacking (High-Risk Path Node):** The attacker attempts to steal or intercept a valid user session to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookies (Critical Node):** An XSS vulnerability in the application allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that steal session cookies.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application (e.g., through user input or a vulnerable endpoint). This script, when executed in another user's browser, can steal the session cookie.
        * **Impact:** Account hijacking.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).
    * **Insecure Cookie Handling (e.g., HTTP Only, Secure flags) (Critical Node):** Session cookies lack the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, making them vulnerable to client-side script access and transmission over insecure connections.
        * **Attack Vector:** If the `HttpOnly` flag is missing, JavaScript can access the session cookie, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. If the `Secure` flag is missing, the cookie can be intercepted if transmitted over an insecure HTTP connection.
        * **Impact:** Account hijacking.
        * **Mitigation:** Ensure Devise session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set in the application's configuration. Enforce HTTPS for all application traffic.
