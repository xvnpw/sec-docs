# Attack Surface Analysis for heartcombo/devise

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force Attacks on Login](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations.
    *   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise provides the core login functionality, and without proper safeguards *within Devise's configuration or through added modules*, it can be a direct target for brute-force attempts. The default Devise setup *might not have aggressive rate limiting or lockout policies enabled by default*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to send numerous login requests with common passwords for a known username, exploiting the lack of built-in rate limiting in a default Devise setup.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure Devise's `lockable` module to temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.
        *   Integrate rate limiting middleware (like `rack-attack`) to protect the login route, which Devise handles.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Vulnerabilities (Predictable Tokens, Lack of Expiration)](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_vulnerabilities__predictable_tokens__lack_of_expiration_.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the password reset process allow attackers to reset passwords for arbitrary accounts. This can involve predictable reset tokens or tokens that don't expire quickly enough.
    *   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise handles password reset token generation and validation. *If the token generation algorithm within Devise is weak or the default token expiration is too long*, it creates a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a pattern in the password reset tokens generated by Devise and uses it to forge a valid token for another user's account. Or, an attacker intercepts an old password reset link generated by Devise that is still valid due to a long default expiration.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Devise's password reset token generator uses a cryptographically secure random number generator (this is generally the default, but verify configuration).
        *   Configure a short expiration time for password reset tokens within Devise's configuration (e.g., using `reset_password_within`).
        *   Ensure the application uses HTTPS to protect the transmission of password reset links generated by Devise.

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a session ID that the attacker controls, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.
    *   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise manages user sessions. *If Devise is not configured to properly regenerate the session ID upon successful login*, it can be vulnerable to session fixation attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link with a pre-set session ID. If Devise's configuration doesn't enforce session regeneration on login, the attacker can use that same ID to access the user's account after they log in.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Devise is configured to regenerate the session ID upon successful login. This is generally the default behavior, but it's important to verify the configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remember_me_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** The "remember me" feature, if not implemented securely, can allow attackers to gain persistent access to user accounts.
    *   **How Devise Contributes:** Devise provides the "remember me" functionality through the `rememberable` module and manages the generation and validation of remember me tokens stored in cookies. *Weaknesses in Devise's token generation or storage can lead to vulnerabilities.*
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a user's computer and steals the "remember me" cookie generated by Devise, allowing them to impersonate the user even after the user has logged out.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Devise's "remember me" tokens are securely generated and stored (this is generally the default, but review configuration).
        *   Consider the security implications of the `remember_for` configuration option in Devise and set an appropriate expiration time.
        *   Implement mechanisms to invalidate "remember me" tokens managed by Devise (e.g., upon password change or account compromise).
