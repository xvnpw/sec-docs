# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/simple_form

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe HTML Generation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsafe_html_generation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into form elements (labels, hints, error messages, custom content) rendered *directly by `simple_form`*. This code executes in the victim's browser when they view the form, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting them to malicious sites. The vulnerability arises when `simple_form` renders user-provided data without proper HTML escaping.

    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, and loss of user trust.

    *   **Affected `simple_form` Component:** Rendering logic for labels, hints, error messages, or custom content within form elements. Specifically, the code within `simple_form` that outputs these strings into the HTML structure.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure proper escaping by default:** Verify that `simple_form`'s default configuration ensures HTML escaping of user-provided data. If not, configure it accordingly.
        *   **Double-check custom content:** When providing custom content (e.g., through blocks or helpers) to `simple_form`, ensure you are manually escaping any user-provided data before passing it to `simple_form`.
        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks even if they occur.
        *   **Regularly update `simple_form`:** Keep the gem updated to benefit from potential security fixes.

## Threat: [HTML Injection through Custom Input Wrappers and Components](./threats/html_injection_through_custom_input_wrappers_and_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML code into the form structure by exploiting vulnerabilities in *custom input wrappers or components specifically designed for `simple_form`*. This allows them to manipulate the form's appearance and behavior, potentially leading to phishing attacks or defacement. The vulnerability occurs when developers create custom wrappers that directly render unsanitized user input as HTML.

    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks (e.g., creating fake login forms), website defacement, and potentially tricking users into providing sensitive information.

    *   **Affected `simple_form` Component:** The custom input wrapper API and the rendering logic within developer-created custom wrappers and components used by `simple_form`.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize user input in custom wrappers:** When developing custom wrappers or components for `simple_form`, rigorously sanitize any user-provided data before rendering it as HTML. Use libraries like `Rails::Html::Sanitizer` or similar tools.
        *   **Avoid direct HTML rendering of untrusted data:** Minimize the direct output of user-controlled strings as HTML within custom components.
        *   **Review custom component code:** Regularly review the code for custom wrappers and components for potential HTML injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Follow secure coding practices for custom components:** Adhere to established security guidelines when building custom extensions for `simple_form`.
