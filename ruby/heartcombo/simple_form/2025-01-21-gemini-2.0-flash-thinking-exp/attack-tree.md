```


## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Labels/Hints/Errors (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_labelshintserrors__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging unsanitized user-provided data in `simple_form`'s `label`, `hint`, or error message options.

**How it Works:**

*   Developers might dynamically generate form labels, hints, or error messages using data sourced from user input, databases, or external APIs.
*   If this data is not properly sanitized (e.g., by escaping HTML characters), an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into this data.
*   When the form is rendered in the user's browser, the injected code is interpreted and executed.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies to impersonate the user.
*   **Credential Theft:** Capture user credentials entered on the page.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirect the user to a phishing site or a site hosting malware.
*   **Defacement:** Alter the appearance of the web page.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit potential vulnerabilities in custom input types or wrappers (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_potential_vulnerabilities_in_custom_input_types_or_wrappers__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting security flaws within custom input types or wrappers created by developers to extend `simple_form`'s functionality.

**How it Works:**

*   Developers might create custom input components to handle specific data types or interactions.
*   If these custom components process user input without proper validation or sanitization, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   For example, a custom component might directly evaluate user-provided data or use it in system commands without escaping.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the custom component interacts with the server-side in an unsafe manner, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **SQL Injection:** If the custom component interacts with a database without proper parameterization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL queries.
*   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on the custom component's functionality, other injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection) might be possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in Simple Form's dependencies (Indirectly related High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_simple_form's_dependencies__indirectly_related_high-risk_path_&_critical__6faceeb8.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Leveraging known security vulnerabilities present in the libraries and frameworks that `simple_form` depends on (e.g., Rails, its specific version's dependencies).

**How it Works:**

*   Software dependencies can contain security vulnerabilities that are discovered over time.
*   Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application is using outdated or vulnerable versions of its dependencies.
*   Exploits for common dependency vulnerabilities are often publicly available.

**Potential Impact:**

*   The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Common impacts include:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerabilities in rendering engines or helper functions.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerabilities in database adapters or query builders.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Vulnerabilities in core framework components.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to crash the application.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass login mechanisms.
