# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for heartcombo/simple_form

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model-Driven Validation with Simple_Form](./mitigation_strategies/model-driven_validation_with_simple_form.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define comprehensive server-side validations directly within your Rails models. This is where you specify rules for data integrity (e.g., presence, format, length, uniqueness).
    *   Step 2: Ensure your `simple_form` forms are built for and associated with these validated models.  When you use `simple_form_for @model` or `simple_form_with model: @model`, the form is inherently linked to the model's validations.
    *   Step 3: In your controllers, always check model validity using `@model.valid?` before attempting to save data. If `@model.valid?` returns `false`, re-render the form (using `render :edit` or `render :new`) to display validation errors to the user.
    *   Step 4: Leverage `simple_form`'s built-in error display features (e.g., `f.error_notification`, `f.full_error`) to present server-side validation errors clearly and user-friendly within the form itself. This ensures users are guided to correct invalid input based on your model's rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium (Invalid data being saved to the database due to lack of server-side validation, potentially leading to application errors and data corruption).
    *   Bypassing Application Logic - Severity: Medium (Insufficient validation allowing users to submit data that circumvents intended application behavior).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues - High Reduction (Enforces data integrity at the model level, preventing invalid data from being persisted through forms created with `simple_form`).
    *   Bypassing Application Logic - Medium Reduction (Reduces the risk of users submitting data that bypasses intended application rules enforced by validations).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Verification (Check models for comprehensive validations and controllers for proper validation checks and error handling when using forms created with `simple_form`).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing in:
    *   Models lacking sufficient validation rules for attributes used in `simple_form` forms.
    *   Controllers not checking `@model.valid?` and not re-rendering forms with errors when validation fails after `simple_form` submission.
    *   Forms using `simple_form` but not fully leveraging its error display capabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leveraging Simple_Form's Form Builders with Strong Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/leveraging_simple_form's_form_builders_with_strong_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When using `simple_form_for` or `simple_form_with`, remember that these helpers generate standard Rails forms.  The security of data handling after form submission relies heavily on strong parameters in your controllers.
    *   Step 2: In your controller actions that process `simple_form` submissions (e.g., `create`, `update`), always implement strong parameter filtering. Use `params.require(:[model_name]).permit(...)` to explicitly whitelist the attributes that are allowed to be modified via the form.
    *   Step 3:  Ensure the permitted attributes in your strong parameters method directly correspond to the input fields you've defined in your `simple_form`. Only permit attributes that are intended to be modified through that specific form.
    *   Step 4:  Regularly review your strong parameter definitions whenever you modify your `simple_form` forms or model attributes to ensure they remain accurate and secure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability - Severity: High (Attackers manipulating form parameters to modify model attributes that were not intended to be exposed through the form, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability - High Reduction (Strong parameter filtering, when correctly applied in conjunction with `simple_form` usage, effectively prevents mass assignment attacks).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Verification (Review controllers handling `simple_form` submissions to confirm strong parameter filtering is in place and correctly configured, especially in relation to the form fields defined in `simple_form`).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing in:
    *   Controllers that process forms created with `simple_form` but lack proper strong parameter filtering.
    *   Strong parameter definitions that are too broad, permitting more attributes than necessary for the specific `simple_form`.
    *   Areas where developers might mistakenly rely on client-side validation or forget server-side parameter filtering when using `simple_form`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection with Simple_Form (Implicit)](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_with_simple_form__implicit_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Understand that `simple_form_for` and `simple_form_with` are wrappers around Rails' built-in form helpers (`form_with`, `form_tag`). These Rails helpers automatically include CSRF protection by default.
    *   Step 2: As long as you are using `simple_form_for` or `simple_form_with` to generate your forms, and CSRF protection is enabled in your `ApplicationController` (which is the default in Rails), CSRF tokens will be automatically included in your forms.
    *   Step 3:  Avoid manually constructing form HTML when using `simple_form`. Stick to using `simple_form`'s helpers to ensure CSRF protection is maintained.
    *   Step 4: For AJAX submissions originating from `simple_form` forms, ensure you are correctly handling CSRF tokens in your JavaScript code by including the `X-CSRF-Token` header in your AJAX requests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Severity: Medium (Malicious websites or attackers performing actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized data changes or actions).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - High Reduction (Using `simple_form`'s form helpers correctly ensures Rails' built-in CSRF protection is active for forms, mitigating CSRF attacks).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Implemented (CSRF protection is a default Rails feature and `simple_form` leverages Rails form helpers. However, AJAX handling needs verification).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing in:
    *   AJAX interactions with forms created by `simple_form` that do not correctly include CSRF tokens in AJAX requests.
    *   Unusual cases where developers might have bypassed `simple_form` helpers and manually constructed forms, potentially missing CSRF protection.
