# Threat Model Analysis for heartcombo/simple_form

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Error Message Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_error_message_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious input that, when processed by the application and subsequently rendered by `simple_form` as an error message, injects JavaScript code into the page. This script could then steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser. The attacker would rely on the application displaying unsanitized user input within the error messages generated by `simple_form`.

    *   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application.

    *   **Affected Simple Form Component:** `SimpleForm::Wrappers::Errors` module, specifically when rendering error messages associated with form inputs.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all user-provided data displayed in error messages is properly HTML escaped before being rendered by `simple_form`. Utilize Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `h` helper).
        *   Review custom error message rendering logic within your application that might interact with `simple_form`.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [HTML Injection via Form Input Attributes](./threats/html_injection_via_form_input_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide input that, when used to populate HTML attributes of form elements generated by `simple_form` (e.g., default values, hints, labels), injects arbitrary HTML. This could lead to phishing attacks by displaying fake UI elements or manipulating the appearance of the form. The attacker would exploit scenarios where user-controlled data is directly used to set HTML attributes without proper sanitization.

    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, UI manipulation, potential for tricking users into providing sensitive information.

    *   **Affected Simple Form Component:** `SimpleForm::Inputs::Base` and its subclasses, particularly when rendering attributes like `placeholder`, `hint`, or `label` based on dynamic data.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While previously classified as Medium, the potential for phishing could be argued as High depending on the context and sensitivity of the application. However, sticking to the previous classification for consistency based on the explicit request to update the prior list.)*

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data when it's used to populate HTML attributes within `simple_form` elements.
        *   Carefully review any logic that dynamically sets attributes based on user input.
        *   Consider using parameterized values or safe list approaches for attribute values where appropriate.
