# Attack Surface Analysis for heartcombo/simple_form

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input Labels/Hints/Placeholders](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input_labelshintsplaceholders.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through form element attributes like labels, hints, or placeholders. When the form is rendered, this code executes in the user's browser.
*   **Simple_form Contribution:** `simple_form` provides options to easily customize labels, hints, and placeholders. If these options are populated with user-controlled data without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for XSS attacks.
*   **Example:**
    ```ruby
    <%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
      <%= f.input :name, label: params[:dynamic_label] %>
    <% end %>
    ```
    If `params[:dynamic_label]` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, `simple_form` will render this directly into the label HTML, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, sensitive data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, session hijacking, and other malicious actions performed in the user's browser context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Sanitization:**  *Always* sanitize any user-provided data or data originating from external sources before using it in `simple_form` options like `label`, `hint`, `placeholder`, or any other HTML attribute. Utilize Rails' built-in sanitization mechanisms such as `ERB::Util.html_escape` or `sanitize`.
    *   **Secure Data Handling Practices:**  Implement robust input validation and output encoding practices throughout the application to minimize the risk of unsanitized data reaching `simple_form` rendering.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection via Custom Input Wrappers/Components](./attack_surfaces/html_injection_via_custom_input_wrapperscomponents.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject arbitrary HTML code into the form structure by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom input wrappers or components defined within `simple_form` configurations. This can lead to manipulation of the form's appearance, functionality, or the introduction of malicious elements.
*   **Simple_form Contribution:** `simple_form`'s customization features allow developers to define custom wrappers and components for form elements. If these custom elements are not carefully implemented and fail to sanitize dynamic content or configuration options, they become vulnerable to HTML injection.
*   **Example:**
    ```ruby
    # Custom wrapper (simplified, vulnerable example)
    SimpleForm.wrappers :custom_wrapper do |b|
      b.use :html5
      b.optional :placeholder
      b.wrapper tag: :div, class: params[:wrapper_class] do |ba| # Vulnerable line
        ba.use :label
        ba.use :input
      end
    end
    ```
    If `params[:wrapper_class]` is manipulated to contain malicious HTML like `"><img src=x onerror=alert('HTML Injection')>`, `simple_form` will inject this directly into the HTML structure, potentially breaking out of intended attributes and injecting arbitrary HTML.
*   **Impact:** Website defacement, phishing attacks by altering form appearance, redirection to external malicious sites, and potentially Cross-Site Scripting if the injected HTML includes JavaScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Sanitization in Custom Elements:**  Enforce rigorous sanitization of *all* dynamic data used within custom wrappers and components, especially when setting HTML attributes like `class`, `id`, `style`, or any attributes that control HTML structure.
    *   **Input Validation for Customizations:**  Validate the format and content of any data used to configure custom wrappers and components to ensure it conforms to expected values and does not contain potentially malicious HTML or control characters.
    *   **Secure Component Design:** Design custom wrappers and components with security in mind. Avoid directly embedding raw dynamic data into HTML attributes without careful encoding and validation. Favor using parameterized or templated approaches where possible.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Customizations:** Conduct regular security reviews and testing specifically targeting custom `simple_form` wrappers and components to identify and remediate potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration leading to Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data in Form Values)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_leading_to_information_disclosure__sensitive_data_in_form_values_.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect or insecure configuration of `simple_form` options can lead to the unintentional exposure of sensitive information directly within form field values in the HTML source code.
*   **Simple_form Contribution:** `simple_form`'s flexible configuration, particularly the `input_html` option, allows developers to directly set HTML attributes, including the `value` attribute. Misusing this to pre-populate sensitive data can lead to information leakage.
*   **Example:**
    ```ruby
    <%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
      <%= f.input :password, input_html: { value: @user.password } %> # Pre-populating password field - CRITICAL MISTAKE
    <% end %>
    ```
    This example, while illustrative of a severe misconfiguration, demonstrates how `simple_form`'s `input_html` option, if misused, can directly embed sensitive data (like a password in this extreme case) into the HTML `value` attribute, making it visible in the page source.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive credentials (like passwords in the example), personal identifiable information (PII), API keys, or other confidential data directly in the HTML source, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, and further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Pre-populate Password Fields:**  Absolutely *never* pre-populate password fields or any sensitive credential fields with existing values in forms. Password fields should always be blank for user input.
    *   **Careful Use of `input_html[:value]`:** Exercise extreme caution when using the `input_html: { value: ... }` option in `simple_form`. Ensure that you are *never* directly embedding sensitive data into the `value` attribute.  This option should primarily be used for non-sensitive, pre-defined default values or for very specific, controlled use cases where security implications are fully understood and mitigated.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews for Configuration:** Conduct regular code reviews specifically focused on `simple_form` configurations to identify and prevent any accidental or insecure use of options that could lead to information disclosure, especially concerning the `input_html` option and similar configurations.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the security risks associated with form handling and the potential for information disclosure through misconfigurations, particularly when using flexible form generation libraries like `simple_form`.
