# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a Ruby on Rails library called `simple_form` which aims to simplify and streamline the process of creating forms in Ruby on Rails applications. The primary business priority is to enhance developer productivity by providing a more intuitive and concise way to define forms, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability of Rails applications that utilize forms. The goal is to offer a flexible and user-friendly form builder that caters to common form patterns and customization needs within the Rails ecosystem.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Introduction of vulnerabilities: Security flaws in the `simple_form` library could be inherited by all Rails applications that depend on it. This could lead to potential security breaches in those applications, impacting their users and the businesses relying on them.
- Dependency risk: As a library, `simple_form` depends on other Ruby gems and the Ruby on Rails framework itself. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect `simple_form` and the applications using it.
- Maintainability and long-term support: If the library is not actively maintained or becomes outdated, it could become a liability for projects that depend on it. Lack of updates and security patches could lead to increased risk over time.
- Adoption risk: If the library is not well-received by the Ruby on Rails community or fails to address developer needs effectively, its adoption rate might be low, limiting its business value and impact.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the `simple_form` project are currently limited, typical for many open-source libraries focused on functionality:

- security control: GitHub repository with version control. Implemented in: GitHub.
- security control: Publicly accessible source code. Implemented in: GitHub.
- accepted risk: Lack of automated security scanning.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security awareness.
- accepted risk: No formal security audit process.

Recommended security controls to implement as high priority:

- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report issues responsibly.
- recommended security control: Consider performing periodic security audits, especially before major releases.

Security requirements for the `simple_form` project:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is handled by the consuming Rails applications.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is handled by the consuming Rails applications.
- Input Validation: While `simple_form` generates HTML form elements, input validation is primarily the responsibility of the Rails application server-side code that processes form submissions. However, `simple_form` should generate forms that facilitate proper client-side validation (e.g., using HTML5 validation attributes) and not hinder server-side validation.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of `simple_form` as a form builder. Cryptographic operations are handled by the consuming Rails applications when dealing with sensitive data in forms. However, `simple_form` should not introduce any practices that would weaken cryptography in consuming applications (e.g., insecure defaults in form generation related to sensitive data).

## BUILD

Build Process Diagram:

    A["Developer\n(Code Changes)"] --> B["Git Repository\n(GitHub)"];
    B --> C["CI System\n(GitHub Actions)"];
    C --> D{"Build Process\n(Linting, Testing,\nPackaging)"};
    D -- "Success" --> E["RubyGems\nRepository"];
    D -- "Failure" --> F["Developer\nNotifications"];
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes to the `simple_form` library and commits them to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. The CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code changes pushed to the repository.
3. The CI system executes the build process, which typically includes:
    - Linting: Code style checks and static analysis.
    - Testing: Running unit and integration tests to ensure code functionality.
    - Packaging: Creating the Ruby gem package.
4. If the build process is successful, the CI system publishes the gem package to the RubyGems repository.
5. If the build process fails (e.g., tests fail, linting errors), the CI system notifies the developers about the failure.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Source code hosted in a version control system (GitHub). Implemented in: GitHub.
- security control: Automated build process using CI (GitHub Actions). Implemented in: GitHub Actions configuration.
- security control: Code linting and static analysis during build. Implemented in: CI build scripts (e.g., using RuboCop).
- security control: Automated unit and integration tests. Implemented in: CI build scripts (e.g., using RSpec).
- recommended security control: Dependency scanning during build to identify vulnerable dependencies. To be implemented in: CI build scripts (e.g., using bundler-audit).
- recommended security control: SAST scanning during build to identify code-level vulnerabilities. To be implemented in: CI build scripts (e.g., using CodeQL).
- security control: Access control to CI/CD pipeline and publishing credentials. Implemented in: GitHub and RubyGems access control settings.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

- Developer productivity and efficiency in building Ruby on Rails applications.
- Reputation and trust in the `simple_form` library within the Ruby on Rails community.
- Security of applications that depend on `simple_form` (indirectly).

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Source code of the `simple_form` library: Sensitivity: Medium. Publicly available but integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent malicious modifications.
- RubyGems publishing credentials: Sensitivity: High. Compromise could lead to malicious gem releases.
- CI/CD pipeline configuration and secrets: Sensitivity: Medium to High. Misconfiguration or compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious builds.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the intended scope of security considerations for this document? Should it primarily focus on the `simple_form` library itself, or also consider the security implications for applications that use it? (Assumption: Focus is primarily on the library itself, but with consideration for its impact on consuming applications).
- What is the current level of security awareness and maturity within the `simple_form` project maintainers and community? (Assumption: Moderate, typical for open-source projects, with room for improvement in formal security practices).
- Are there any specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that the `simple_form` library needs to adhere to? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements beyond general secure coding practices and awareness of common web vulnerabilities).
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in `simple_form`? Is there a defined vulnerability disclosure policy and incident response plan? (Assumption: Currently informal, recommended to formalize a vulnerability disclosure policy).

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and developer-friendly library that simplifies form creation in Rails. Security is important but secondary to functionality and usability in the current project priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic, typical for an open-source library. There is an opportunity to enhance security posture by implementing automated security scanning and establishing a vulnerability disclosure process.
- DESIGN: The design is relatively simple, centered around a Ruby gem. Security considerations should focus on secure coding practices within the gem and ensuring it does not introduce vulnerabilities into consuming applications.
