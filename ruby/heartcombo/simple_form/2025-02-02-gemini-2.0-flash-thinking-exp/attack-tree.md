## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses (High Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_weaknesses__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application validates user input received through Simple Form generated forms. Insufficient or missing server-side validation is the core issue.
*   **1.2. Exploit Server-Side Validation Gaps (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** This critical node highlights the danger of inadequate server-side validation. If the application fails to properly validate data after it's submitted via a Simple Form, attackers can exploit these gaps.
    *   **1.2.1. Inject Malicious Payloads (SQL Injection, Command Injection) (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** This critical node represents the injection of malicious code through form fields. If server-side validation and sanitization are lacking, attackers can inject SQL queries (SQL Injection) to manipulate the database or system commands (Command Injection) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **1.2.2. Provide Unexpected Data Types/Formats (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Attackers provide input in unexpected data types or formats that the application is not designed to handle on the server-side. This can lead to application errors, crashes, or bypasses in application logic.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
    *   **1.2.3. Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** In Rails applications, if `strong_parameters` are not correctly configured, attackers can manipulate form data to update model attributes that should not be publicly accessible. This is a mass assignment vulnerability, allowing unauthorized data modification.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit HTML Rendering/Output Issues (XSS vulnerabilities) (Critical Node, High Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_html_renderingoutput_issues__xss_vulnerabilities___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node and high-risk path focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user input when rendering HTML output, especially data originating from Simple Form inputs.
*   **2.1. Reflected XSS via Form Input Rendering (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** This critical node highlights reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript injected into form fields is echoed back in the server's response (e.g., in error messages) and executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **2.1.1. Inject malicious JavaScript in form fields (Reflected XSS) (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** This critical node is the specific attack step of injecting malicious JavaScript into form fields that are then reflected back without proper escaping, leading to XSS execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **2.2. Stored XSS via Database Interaction (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** This critical node highlights stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript injected through form fields is stored in the database and later rendered to other users without proper escaping, affecting multiple users.
    *   **2.2.1. Inject malicious JavaScript through form fields (Stored XSS) (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** This critical node is the specific attack step of injecting malicious JavaScript through form fields that is stored and later rendered without escaping, leading to persistent XSS.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Critical
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Template Injection in Custom Components (Critical Node, High Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__template_injection_in_custom_components__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node and high-risk path focuses on Template Injection vulnerabilities that can occur if custom Simple Form components use templating engines and improperly handle user-provided data within templates.
*   **3.2. Template Injection in Custom Components (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** This critical node highlights the risk of template injection in custom components. If custom components use templates and user input is directly embedded in templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **3.2.1. Inject malicious code into templates (Template Injection) (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** This critical node is the specific attack step of injecting malicious code into templates used by custom components, leading to potential Remote Code Execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Parameter Tampering via Form Manipulation (High Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__parameter_tampering_via_form_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on parameter tampering, specifically manipulating form data directly, especially hidden fields, to bypass security checks or manipulate application logic.
*   **4.1. Modify Hidden Fields (High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** This high-risk path highlights the risk of attackers modifying hidden form fields to manipulate application behavior.
    *   **4.1.1. Change values of hidden fields (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** This high-risk path is the specific attack step of changing the values of hidden fields in a Simple Form to bypass security checks or alter application logic, such as price manipulation or unauthorized actions.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
