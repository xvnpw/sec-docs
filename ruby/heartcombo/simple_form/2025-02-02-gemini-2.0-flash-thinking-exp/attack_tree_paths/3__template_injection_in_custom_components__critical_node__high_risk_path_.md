### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.2.1. Inject malicious code into templates (Template Injection)

#### 4.1. Understanding Template Injection in Custom `simple_form` Components

**What is Template Injection?**

Template Injection is a server-side vulnerability that arises when a web application embeds user-provided data directly into templates without proper sanitization or escaping. Templating engines, used to dynamically generate web pages, interpret special syntax within templates to perform actions like variable substitution and logic execution. If an attacker can control the template content, they can inject malicious template directives that the server will execute.

**How does it relate to `simple_form` Custom Components?**

`simple_form` is a popular Ruby on Rails gem for creating forms. It allows developers to create custom input components to extend its functionality.  These custom components are often implemented using Ruby code and potentially templating mechanisms to render their HTML output.

The vulnerability arises when developers, while creating custom components, inadvertently use a templating engine (like ERB, Haml, or Slim, which are common in Rails) within their component logic and directly embed user-provided data into these templates *without proper escaping or sanitization*.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a custom `simple_form` component designed to display user-provided text with some formatting. A naive implementation might look something like this (simplified example for illustration, **do not use this in production**):

```ruby
# app/components/custom_text_component.rb
class CustomTextComponent < SimpleForm::Inputs::Base
  def input(wrapper_options)
    merged_input_options = merge_wrapper_options(input_html_options, wrapper_options)

    # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
    template_string = "<div>#{attribute_html_name}: #{options[:text]}</div>" # User-provided text from options[:text]
    ERB.new(template_string).result(binding)
  end
end
```

In this flawed example, the `CustomTextComponent` takes a `:text` option (which could be derived from user input in a form) and directly embeds it into an ERB template string. If an attacker can control the value of `options[:text]`, they can inject malicious ERB code.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  **User Input:** An attacker identifies a form field that utilizes the vulnerable custom component.
2.  **Malicious Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing template directives specific to the templating engine being used (e.g., ERB in Rails).  For example, in ERB, they might use `<%= system('whoami') %>` to attempt Remote Code Execution (RCE).
3.  **Injection:** The attacker submits the malicious payload through the form field, which is then passed as the `options[:text]` to the custom component.
4.  **Template Processing:** The vulnerable custom component's code embeds the malicious payload into the template string and processes it using the templating engine (ERB in this example).
5.  **Code Execution:** The templating engine executes the injected malicious code on the server. In the example payload `<%= system('whoami') %>`, the `system('whoami')` command would be executed on the server, potentially revealing sensitive information or allowing further exploitation.

#### 4.2. Potential Impact (Critical)

The impact of successful Template Injection in custom `simple_form` components is **Critical** due to the potential for **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.  RCE allows an attacker to:

*   **Gain complete control of the server:**  Execute arbitrary commands, install malware, create backdoors, and manipulate system configurations.
*   **Data Breach:** Access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the application's database or file system, including user credentials, personal information, and confidential business data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crash the application or server, disrupting services for legitimate users.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Modify the website's content to display malicious or misleading information, damaging the organization's reputation.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the internal network.

The "Critical" impact rating is justified because a successful attack can lead to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

#### 4.3. Likelihood (Very Low)

The likelihood of this specific attack path is rated as **Very Low**. This is because:

*   **Not a Default `simple_form` Vulnerability:** `simple_form` itself is not inherently vulnerable to Template Injection. The vulnerability arises from *developer error* in creating custom components.
*   **Requires Custom Component Implementation:**  The attack path is only relevant if developers are creating custom `simple_form` components and are using templating engines within those components in a vulnerable way. Many applications might not have complex custom components that utilize templating in this manner.
*   **Developer Awareness (Potentially):**  Developers are generally becoming more aware of common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While Template Injection might be less widely understood, awareness is growing.

However, it's crucial to remember that "Very Low" likelihood does not mean "No Risk".  If a developer *does* make this mistake, the impact is severe.  The "Very Low" rating reflects the probability of encountering this specific vulnerability in a typical application, not the severity of the consequences if it exists.

#### 4.4. Effort (Medium to High)

The effort required to exploit this vulnerability is rated as **Medium to High**.

*   **Identifying Vulnerable Components:**  An attacker needs to identify custom `simple_form` components that are processing user input and potentially using templating engines. This might require some reconnaissance and analysis of the application's code or behavior.
*   **Understanding Templating Engine:**  The attacker needs to understand which templating engine is being used (e.g., ERB, Haml, Slim) and its specific syntax for code execution. This requires some technical knowledge and potentially experimentation.
*   **Crafting Effective Payloads:**  Developing a payload that successfully achieves the attacker's goals (e.g., RCE) might require some trial and error and understanding of the server environment.
*   **Circumventing Defenses (Potentially):**  Depending on the application's security measures, the attacker might need to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or other security controls.

While not trivial, exploiting Template Injection is not as complex as some highly sophisticated attacks.  A skilled attacker with knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and templating engines can successfully exploit this vulnerability with moderate effort.

#### 4.5. Skill Level (Advanced)

The skill level required to exploit this vulnerability is rated as **Advanced**.

*   **Web Application Security Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a solid understanding of web application security principles and common vulnerabilities, specifically Server-Side Template Injection.
*   **Templating Engine Expertise:**  Knowledge of templating engine syntax, capabilities, and security implications is essential.
*   **Code Analysis (Potentially):**  In some cases, the attacker might need to analyze the application's code (even if through reverse engineering or educated guesses) to identify vulnerable components and understand how user input is processed.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  The attacker needs to be proficient in crafting and delivering payloads that exploit the Template Injection vulnerability effectively.

This is not a vulnerability that can be easily exploited by script kiddies. It requires a deeper understanding of web application architecture and security principles.

#### 4.6. Detection Difficulty (Very Hard)

Detecting Template Injection vulnerabilities and attacks is rated as **Very Hard**.

*   **Subtle Attacks:**  Template Injection attacks can be subtle and may not leave obvious traces in standard web application logs.  The malicious code execution happens server-side and might not be directly visible in client-side requests or responses.
*   **Context-Dependent:**  Detection often requires understanding the application's specific logic and how custom components are implemented. Generic security tools might not be effective in identifying these vulnerabilities without specific configuration or rules.
*   **Limited Visibility:**  Traditional security tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or basic WAFs might not be designed to detect Template Injection, especially if the payloads are cleverly crafted to bypass signature-based detection.
*   **False Negatives:**  Automated vulnerability scanners might struggle to accurately identify Template Injection vulnerabilities, leading to false negatives.

Effective detection often requires:

*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Analyzing the application's source code to identify potential areas where user input is embedded in templates without proper sanitization.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Using specialized DAST tools that are designed to detect Template Injection vulnerabilities by sending crafted payloads and analyzing the application's responses.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engaging security experts to manually test the application for Template Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  Implementing RASP solutions that can monitor application behavior at runtime and detect and block Template Injection attacks.
*   **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Regularly conducting security audits and code reviews to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities proactively.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of Template Injection in custom `simple_form` components, development teams should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Avoid Embedding User Input Directly in Templates:**  The most effective mitigation is to **avoid directly embedding user-provided data into template strings within custom components.**  If possible, find alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality without using templating engines to process user input.

2.  **Input Sanitization and Escaping:** If user input *must* be used in templates, **rigorously sanitize and escape all user-provided data** before embedding it.  Use the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms to prevent malicious code from being interpreted.  For example, in ERB, use `<%=h user_input %>` for HTML escaping.

3.  **Use Parameterized Templates or Template Engines with Auto-Escaping:**  If possible, utilize templating engines that support parameterized templates or have auto-escaping enabled by default. This can significantly reduce the risk of Template Injection by treating user input as data rather than code.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the web application with the minimum necessary privileges. If the application is compromised through Template Injection, limiting the privileges of the application user can reduce the potential damage.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF that is configured to detect and block Template Injection attacks.  While not a foolproof solution, a WAF can provide an additional layer of defense.

6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the actions that malicious code can perform even if Template Injection is successful.  For example, restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

7.  **Regular Security Testing and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and remediate Template Injection vulnerabilities.  Perform thorough code reviews to identify potentially vulnerable code patterns in custom components.

8.  **Developer Training:**  Educate developers about Template Injection vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of input sanitization and escaping.

9.  **Secure Templating Practices:**  If using templating engines within custom components is unavoidable, adhere to secure templating practices recommended by the templating engine's documentation.

#### 4.8. Conclusion

Template Injection in custom `simple_form` components represents a critical security risk due to the potential for Remote Code Execution. While the likelihood of this specific vulnerability might be considered "Very Low" due to its reliance on developer error in custom component implementation, the "Critical" impact necessitates proactive mitigation and robust security practices.

Development teams must prioritize secure coding practices, especially when creating custom components that handle user input.  By understanding the mechanisms of Template Injection and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to this dangerous vulnerability and build more secure Ruby on Rails applications using `simple_form`. Regular security testing and ongoing vigilance are crucial to ensure the continued security of applications against this and other evolving threats.
