*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped User Input in Labels/Hints/Placeholders:**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application's web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
    *   **How Simple Form Contributes:** If application code dynamically generates labels, hints, or placeholders using user-provided data and relies solely on `simple_form` for rendering, and this data isn't sanitized *before* being passed to `simple_form`, the gem might render the unsanitized input, leading to XSS. While `simple_form` generally escapes output, developers might use raw output options or inadvertently bypass escaping.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        # In a controller or helper
        @dynamic_label = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"

        # In the view using simple_form
        <%= f.input :name, label: @dynamic_label %>
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize User Input:** Always sanitize user-provided data before using it in labels, hints, or placeholders. Use Rails' built-in `sanitize` helper or other appropriate sanitization libraries.
        *   **Avoid Raw Output:**  Be extremely cautious when using `as: :string, input_html: { value: raw(@unsafe_value) }` or similar raw output options in `simple_form`. Ensure the data is absolutely safe before using raw output.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Default Values:**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information might be unintentionally exposed in the HTML source code as default values for form fields.
    *   **How Simple Form Contributes:** If default values for form fields are dynamically generated based on sensitive information and not handled carefully, `simple_form` will render these values in the HTML source, making them visible to anyone viewing the page source.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        # In a controller
        @user_ssn_last_four = current_user.ssn.last(4)

        # In the view
        <%= f.input :last_four_ssn, as: :string, input_html: { value: @user_ssn_last_four } %>
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), potential for identity theft or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Defaulting Sensitive Data:**  Do not pre-populate form fields with sensitive information unless absolutely necessary and with strong justification.
        *   **Fetch Data on Demand:** If sensitive data is needed, fetch it only after the user interacts with the form (e.g., via AJAX after authentication).
        *   **Consider Server-Side Rendering for Sensitive Defaults:** If default values are unavoidable, consider rendering the form elements containing sensitive defaults on the server-side after authentication and authorization checks.
