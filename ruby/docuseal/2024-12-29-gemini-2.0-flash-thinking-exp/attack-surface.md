Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving Docuseal:

* **Malicious Document Uploads**
    * **Description:** Attackers upload specially crafted documents designed to exploit vulnerabilities in document processing software.
    * **How Docuseal Contributes:** Docuseal's core functionality involves accepting and processing user-uploaded documents for signing workflows. This makes it a direct target for malicious document uploads.
    * **Example:** A user uploads a PDF containing embedded JavaScript that executes when another user views the document within the Docuseal interface, potentially stealing session cookies.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure, potential for remote code execution on the Docuseal server if underlying libraries are vulnerable.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all document uploads. Utilize secure document processing libraries that prevent script execution and other malicious content. Implement malware scanning on uploaded documents. Restrict allowed file types to only necessary formats. Employ sandboxing techniques for document processing.

* **Insecure API Endpoints for Document Management**
    * **Description:** API endpoints used for managing documents (uploading, downloading, deleting, etc.) lack proper security controls.
    * **How Docuseal Contributes:** Docuseal exposes API endpoints for interacting with documents within its system. If these endpoints are not secured, they become attack vectors.
    * **Example:** An attacker could exploit an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the document download API to access documents belonging to other users by manipulating the document ID in the request.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive documents, data breaches, data manipulation or deletion.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Validate all user inputs to API endpoints. Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in API requests (use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers). Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

* **Insecure API Endpoints for Signature Requests**
    * **Description:** API endpoints related to creating, sending, and managing signature requests are vulnerable.
    * **How Docuseal Contributes:** Docuseal provides API functionality to manage the entire signature workflow. Vulnerabilities here can compromise the integrity of the signing process.
    * **Example:** An attacker could manipulate parameters in the signature request creation API to add themselves as a signer to a document they shouldn't have access to, potentially forging a signature.
    * **Impact:** Forged signatures, unauthorized access to signing processes, manipulation of legal agreements.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can create, modify, or view signature requests. Thoroughly validate all input parameters. Use secure methods for identifying and authenticating signers. Implement audit logging for all signature-related actions.

* **Document Conversion Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** If Docuseal performs document conversion (e.g., to a standardized format for signing), vulnerabilities in the conversion libraries can be exploited.
    * **How Docuseal Contributes:** Docuseal might need to convert documents between different formats for processing or display. This conversion process introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted document could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the conversion library, leading to remote code execution on the Docuseal server.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution on the Docuseal server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Utilize well-maintained and regularly updated document conversion libraries. Implement sandboxing for the conversion process. Perform thorough testing of the conversion functionality with various document types, including potentially malicious ones.

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Docuseal relies on third-party libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
    * **How Docuseal Contributes:**  Like most software, Docuseal uses external libraries. If these libraries have known security flaws, Docuseal becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable version of a PDF parsing library used by Docuseal could be exploited by uploading a specially crafted PDF, leading to remote code execution.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions. Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities. Follow security best practices for dependency management.
