```

* **User Action:** The user initiates an action through the Frontend Application (e.g., uploading a document, sending a document for signature).
* **Frontend Handling:** The Frontend Application captures user input and sends a secure API request (HTTPS) to the Backend API.
* **Backend Processing:** The Backend API receives the request, authenticates and authorizes the user, executes the necessary business logic, and interacts with other components.
* **Data Persistence:** The Backend API interacts with the Database to store or retrieve persistent data related to users, documents, and workflows.
* **Document Management:** The Backend API interacts with Document Storage to upload, retrieve, and manage document files.
* **Asynchronous Task Handling:** For tasks that don't require immediate response, the Backend API triggers the Background Worker by adding a task to a message queue.
* **Background Task Execution:** The Background Worker pulls tasks from the queue and executes them (e.g., sending notifications).
* **Notifications:** The Background Worker or Backend API utilizes the Notification Service to send notifications to users via email or other configured channels.
* **Response:** The Backend API sends a response back to the Frontend Application, which updates the user interface accordingly.

## 7. Security Considerations (Detailed)

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Frontend:** Securely stores authentication tokens (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies or local storage with appropriate safeguards). Avoids storing sensitive credentials directly.
    * **Backend API:** Implements JWT or OAuth 2.0 for API authentication. Verifies the authenticity and integrity of tokens before processing requests. Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources based on user roles.
    * **Database:** Uses strong database credentials and restricts access based on the principle of least privilege.
* **Data Protection:**
    * **In Transit:** Enforces HTTPS for all communication between the Frontend and Backend, and between the Backend and other services.
    * **At Rest:** Encrypts sensitive data at rest in the Database and Document Storage using appropriate encryption algorithms. Securely manages encryption keys.
    * **Document Handling:** Generates cryptographically secure hashes of uploaded documents to ensure integrity. Uses digital signatures to guarantee the authenticity and non-repudiation of signed documents.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Frontend:** Implements client-side validation to improve user experience and prevent basic errors.
    * **Backend API:** Performs rigorous server-side validation and sanitization of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
* **Secure Document Handling:**
    * Access to documents in Document Storage is controlled through secure access policies and authentication.
    * Only authorized users and services can access and modify documents.
    * Audit logs track all document access and modification events.

    * Uses secure session tokens with appropriate expiration times.
    * Implements measures to prevent session fixation and hijacking.
* **Background Worker Security:**
    * Secure communication between the Backend API and the Background Worker (e.g., using authenticated message queues).
    * Proper authorization for tasks performed by the Background Worker.
* **Notification Service Security:**
    * Uses secure protocols for communication with the Notification Service.
    * Protects API keys or credentials used to access the Notification Service.
* **Regular Security Practices:**
    * Conducts regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    * Implements a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    * Keeps all software and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * Complies with relevant data privacy and security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, depending on the target audience and data handled).
