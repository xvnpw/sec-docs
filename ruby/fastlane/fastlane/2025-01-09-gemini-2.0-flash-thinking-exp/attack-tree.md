## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Fastlane Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_fastlane_itself__critical_node_.md)

**1. Exploit Known Fastlane Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Fastlane core or its dependencies.
*   **Mechanism:** Exploits are developed and used to target unpatched installations of Fastlane.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Fastlane process, potentially granting the attacker control over the build and release pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Fastfile [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_fastfile__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**2. Compromise the Fastfile [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector: Direct Modification of Fastfile:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the repository or development environment where the `Fastfile` is stored.
    *   **Impact:** They directly modify the `Fastfile` to introduce malicious commands, scripts, or configurations that will be executed during the Fastlane process.
*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code via Included Files/Scripts:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers compromise files or scripts that are referenced or included by the `Fastfile`.
    *   **Impact:** When the `Fastfile` executes, it will also execute the malicious code injected into these included files, leading to potential compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables__high_risk_path_.md)

**3. Manipulate Environment Variables [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector: Exfiltrate Sensitive Information via Environment Variables [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain access to the environment where Fastlane is executed and read the values of environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** If sensitive credentials, API keys, or other secrets are stored as environment variables (a common but insecure practice), the attacker can easily exfiltrate this information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**4. Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector: Utilize Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party Fastlane plugins used by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable plugin, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or manipulating the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Credentials Used by Fastlane [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_credentials_used_by_fastlane__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**5. Compromise Credentials Used by Fastlane [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector: Steal API Keys and Tokens:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Access Stored Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain access to locations where Fastlane stores API keys and tokens, such as within the `Fastfile` itself (highly insecure), configuration files, or less secure credential management systems.
        *   **Impact:** Once obtained, these credentials can be used to access external services, impersonate legitimate users, and potentially further compromise the application or associated systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Code Signing Certificates/Profiles [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_code_signing_certificatesprofiles__critical_node_.md)

**6. Compromise Code Signing Certificates/Profiles [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the code signing certificates and provisioning profiles used by Fastlane to sign application builds.
*   **Mechanism:** This can involve compromising secure storage locations, developer accounts, or build servers where these sensitive assets are managed.
*   **Impact:** With compromised signing credentials, attackers can sign and distribute malicious versions of the application that will appear legitimate to users and security systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_via_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

**7. Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector: Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers create malicious packages with names similar to legitimate Fastlane dependencies or their sub-dependencies and publish them to public repositories.
    *   **Impact:** If the application's dependency management is not configured correctly, or if there are vulnerabilities in the resolution process, the build system might inadvertently download and install the malicious package, leading to arbitrary code execution during the build process.
