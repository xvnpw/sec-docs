# Threat Model Analysis for fastlane/fastlane

## Threat: [Compromised Fastfile](./threats/compromised_fastfile.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `Fastfile` (and potentially other configuration files like `Appfile`, `Gymfile`). They modify the file to inject malicious code that will be executed during Fastlane runs. This could involve adding steps to exfiltrate data, build backdoors into the application, or manipulate the deployment process.

**Impact:** Creation of backdoored application builds, exfiltration of sensitive data (API keys, credentials, source code), unauthorized deployment of malicious application versions to app stores, disruption of the development and deployment pipeline.

**Affected Component:** Core Fastlane functionality, specifically the execution of the `Fastfile`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to the repository containing the `Fastfile` and other configuration files.
* Implement code review processes for changes to the `Fastfile`.
* Store sensitive information (credentials, API keys) outside of the `Fastfile` using secure methods like environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools.
* Regularly audit the `Fastfile` for suspicious or unexpected commands.
* Use file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the `Fastfile`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Fastfile or Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials_in_fastfile_or_environment_variables.md)

**Description:**  Developers hardcode sensitive credentials (e.g., app store credentials, signing certificates passwords, API keys) directly into the `Fastfile` or expose them through insufficiently protected environment variables that are accessible during Fastlane execution. An attacker gaining access to these files or the environment can retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to app store accounts, leading to potential app updates with malicious content, data breaches, or account takeover. Compromise of signing certificates, allowing the signing of malicious applications impersonating the legitimate app. Unauthorized access to other services via exposed API keys.

**Affected Component:** Core Fastlane functionality, environment variable access during Fastlane execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never** hardcode sensitive credentials in the `Fastfile`.
* Utilize secure credential management tools (e.g., `match`, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve credentials.
* Use environment variables for sensitive information but ensure they are managed securely and not exposed in logs or version control.
* Implement proper access controls on systems where environment variables are set.
* Consider using Fastlane's built-in credential management features securely.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting in Fastlane Dependencies](./threats/dependency_confusiontyposquatting_in_fastlane_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Fastlane relies on RubyGems and other dependencies. An attacker creates a malicious package with a name similar to a legitimate Fastlane dependency (typosquatting) or a completely new malicious package that a developer might mistakenly include in their Gemfile. When `bundle install` is run, the malicious package is downloaded and its code can be executed during Fastlane execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the CI/CD server, potentially leading to data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, or disruption of the build process.

**Affected Component:** Dependency management (Bundler, RubyGems).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock for any unexpected or suspicious dependencies.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Configure Bundler to use a private gem server or a trusted source for gems.
* Implement a process for vetting new dependencies before adding them to the project.
* Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Fastlane Tooling Updates](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_fastlane_tooling_updates.md)

**Description:** When updating Fastlane or its dependencies (e.g., using `gem update fastlane`), an attacker intercepts the download process (e.g., through a compromised network or DNS poisoning) and replaces the legitimate files with a malicious version.

**Impact:** Installation of a compromised version of Fastlane or its dependencies, potentially containing backdoors, malware, or code that can steal credentials or manipulate the build process.

**Affected Component:** Fastlane update mechanism, RubyGems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure and trusted networks for updating Fastlane and its dependencies.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or signatures if available.
* Consider using a private gem mirror to control the source of updates.
* Be cautious when performing updates on public or untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Usage](./threats/insecure_plugin_usage.md)

**Description:** Developers use community-developed Fastlane plugins without proper vetting or security review. These plugins might contain vulnerabilities (e.g., allowing arbitrary command execution) or malicious code intentionally inserted by the plugin author.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD server, potentially leading to data breaches, credential theft, or manipulation of the build and deployment process.

**Affected Component:** Fastlane plugin system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the code of any third-party plugins before using them.
* Prefer well-maintained and reputable plugins with a strong community.
* Be cautious about using plugins from unknown or untrusted sources.
* Consider using plugin linters or security scanners if available.
* Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Fastlane Configuration Files](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_fastlane_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** The `.fastlane` directory and its contents (including potentially sensitive configurations) are accidentally committed to a public repository or otherwise exposed (e.g., through misconfigured cloud storage).

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, and internal deployment processes to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to account compromise, unauthorized app updates, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Fastlane configuration file storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the `.fastlane` directory is properly excluded from version control (e.g., using `.gitignore`).
* Regularly audit repository contents to ensure no sensitive information is accidentally committed.
* Implement secure storage practices for backups and archives containing Fastlane configuration.
* Educate developers on the risks of exposing sensitive configuration data.

## Threat: [Compromised API Keys or Tokens Used by Fastlane Actions](./threats/compromised_api_keys_or_tokens_used_by_fastlane_actions.md)

**Description:** Fastlane actions often require API keys or tokens to interact with external services (e.g., app stores, CI/CD platforms, analytics providers). If these keys are compromised (e.g., through insecure storage within Fastlane configuration or a vulnerable plugin), attackers can use them to perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized app submissions, modification of app metadata, access to analytics data, potential financial losses if the compromised service involves payments.

**Affected Component:** Fastlane actions interacting with external APIs, potentially insecure plugin usage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store API keys and tokens securely using dedicated secrets management tools, not directly in Fastlane configuration files.
* Avoid hardcoding API keys in the `Fastfile` or committing them to version control.
* Regularly rotate API keys and tokens.
* Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
* Utilize the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
