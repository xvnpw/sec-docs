## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `fastlane` or Plugins](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__fastlane__or_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** `fastlane` and its plugins rely on numerous Ruby gems and other dependencies. These dependencies may contain publicly known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the `fastlane` environment, potentially leading to remote code execution or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Remote code execution on the build machine or CI/CD agent, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Affected Fastlane Component:** `fastlane` core dependencies, plugin dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan `fastlane` and plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit`.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions using `bundle update`.
    *   Implement a process for patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities promptly.

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in `Fastfile` or Configuration Files](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in__fastfile__or_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Hardcoded Secrets
*   **Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcode sensitive information like API keys, passwords, certificates, or provisioning profile passwords directly into `Fastfile`, `.env` files, or other configuration files within the project. If these files are exposed, attackers can easily extract these secrets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical to High:** Account compromise for services protected by the hardcoded credentials (e.g., App Store Connect, Google Play Console), unauthorized access to backend systems, potential data breaches.
*   **Affected Fastlane Component:** `Fastfile`, `.env` files, configuration loading mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode secrets directly in configuration files.**
    *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., `dotenv`, HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) to store and access secrets.
    *   Ensure configuration files are not accidentally committed to version control systems by using `.gitignore` appropriately.

## Threat: [Exposed Secrets in Version Control](./threats/exposed_secrets_in_version_control.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposed Secrets in Version Control
*   **Description:** Configuration files containing secrets, or files used to generate secrets, are mistakenly committed to version control repositories (e.g., Git). Attackers who gain access to the repository history can retrieve the exposed secrets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Secrets become accessible to anyone with access to the version control repository, leading to account compromise and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Fastlane Component:** Version control integration, project configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly avoid committing secret-containing files to version control.
    *   Use `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude sensitive files and directories.
    *   Regularly audit version control repositories for accidentally committed secrets using secret scanning tools.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets in CI/CD Environment](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets_in_cicd_environment.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure CI/CD Secrets Storage
*   **Description:** Secrets required by `fastlane` in a CI/CD environment are stored insecurely, such as plain text environment variables or easily accessible files on the CI/CD agent. Attackers compromising the CI/CD environment can easily access these secrets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Compromise of the CI/CD environment leads to secret exposure, account compromise, and potential manipulation of the build and deployment pipeline.
*   **Affected Fastlane Component:** CI/CD integration, environment variable handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secret management features provided by the CI/CD platform (e.g., encrypted secrets, secret vaults, masked variables).
    *   Avoid storing secrets as plain text environment variables if possible; use secure secret injection mechanisms.
    *   Implement proper access control to the CI/CD environment and secret storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Abuse of API Keys/Tokens for Integrated Services](./threats/abuse_of_api_keystokens_for_integrated_services.md)

*   **Threat:** API Key/Token Abuse
*   **Description:** If API keys or tokens used by `fastlane` to interact with services like App Store Connect or Google Play Console are compromised, attackers can misuse these credentials to gain unauthorized access to developer accounts, manipulate app listings, or distribute malicious app updates.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Unauthorized access to developer accounts on integrated services, manipulation of app listings, distribution of malicious app updates, data breaches.
*   **Affected Fastlane Component:** API key/token management, integration with external services.
