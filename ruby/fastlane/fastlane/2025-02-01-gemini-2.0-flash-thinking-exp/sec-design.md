# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, fastlane, aims to streamline and automate the build, test, and release process for mobile applications (iOS and Android).

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Accelerate mobile app release cycles.
  - Reduce manual effort and potential errors in the deployment process.
  - Improve consistency and reliability of app releases.
  - Enable faster iteration and delivery of new features and bug fixes.
  - Enhance developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Disruption of app release pipeline due to fastlane malfunction or misconfiguration.
  - Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys, signing certificates) if fastlane is compromised or misconfigured.
  - Unintended or unauthorized app releases due to automation errors or security vulnerabilities.
  - Dependency on a third-party open-source tool, with potential risks related to maintenance, security updates, and community support.
  - Compatibility issues with evolving mobile platforms, development tools, and app stores, potentially breaking the automation workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Project - publicly available code allows for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Code Review - contributions are reviewed by maintainers before merging. Implemented: GitHub pull request process.
  - security control: Dependency Management - uses Bundler for Ruby dependency management, helping to manage and track dependencies. Implemented: Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.
  - security control: HTTPS for communication - communication with app stores and other services should be over HTTPS. Implemented: within fastlane code, leveraging underlying libraries.
  - security control: Credential Management - encourages the use of environment variables or secure credential storage solutions (like Keychain or environment managers) for sensitive information. Implemented: documented best practices and examples.
  - security control: Plugin System - modular architecture allows for extending functionality, but also introduces potential risks from third-party plugins. Implemented: fastlane plugin architecture.
  - security control: Documentation - provides documentation on usage and best practices, including security considerations. Implemented: fastlane official documentation website.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party plugins.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by users leading to security issues (e.g., insecure credential storage).
  - accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities in underlying Ruby libraries and gems.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline for fastlane development.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities in the fastlane codebase.
  - security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) - Consider DAST for testing fastlane in a runtime environment, although applicability might be limited for a CLI tool.
  - security control: Security Audits - Periodic security audits of the fastlane codebase by security experts.
  - security control: Plugin Security Review Process - Establish guidelines and potentially automated checks for plugin security before they are officially recommended or promoted.
  - security control: Secure Credential Storage Guidance - Provide more detailed and prescriptive guidance on secure credential storage options and discourage insecure practices in documentation and examples.
  - security control: Supply Chain Security - Implement measures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of fastlane releases and dependencies.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Fastlane itself does not directly handle user authentication. Authentication is delegated to the services it interacts with (e.g., app stores, Git repositories).
    - Requirement: When interacting with services, fastlane should support secure authentication methods like API keys, tokens, and certificate-based authentication, as recommended by the respective service providers.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Fastlane should respect the authorization models of the services it interacts with.
    - Requirement: Users configuring fastlane should have appropriate permissions to perform actions in connected services (e.g., deploy apps to app stores).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Fastlane should validate all inputs, including configuration files (Fastfile), command-line arguments, and responses from external services, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied to data formats, data types, and allowed values.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Fastlane should use cryptography appropriately to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest, where applicable.
    - Requirement: Securely handle and store cryptographic keys and certificates used for code signing and secure communication.
    - Requirement: Utilize established and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Mobile Application Release Process: fastlane directly automates and supports the process of building, testing, and releasing mobile applications. Disruption or compromise of fastlane can directly impact the ability to release app updates and new apps, affecting revenue, user experience, and business reputation.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Credentials (API Keys, Tokens, Passwords, Signing Certificates): fastlane manages and uses sensitive credentials to interact with app stores, code signing services, and other platforms. Exposure of these credentials could lead to unauthorized access to app store accounts, code signing key compromise, and potential supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: High.
  - Application Source Code and Configurations (Fastfile): While fastlane itself is open source, the Fastfile and application code it manages are often proprietary and contain business logic. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to intellectual property theft or malicious code injection. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the application).
  - Build Artifacts (IPA, APK files): These are the packaged mobile applications ready for release. Tampering with these artifacts could lead to distribution of compromised applications. Sensitivity: Medium.
  - Notification Data: Information about build and release status, which might contain sensitive project names or release details. Sensitivity: Low to Medium.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific secure credential storage mechanisms are officially recommended and actively promoted by the fastlane project?
  - Are there any automated security checks or vulnerability scanning processes currently integrated into the fastlane development CI/CD pipeline?
  - Is there a formal process for security review of community-contributed plugins?
  - What are the guidelines for developers creating fastlane plugins to ensure plugin security?
  - Are there any documented security incident response procedures for the fastlane project?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that the primary business goal for using fastlane is to improve the efficiency and speed of mobile app releases. Security is considered important but might be balanced against development velocity, especially in early-stage projects.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that while fastlane is an open-source project with community contributions, security is a concern, and basic security practices like code review and HTTPS are in place. However, more advanced security controls might be lacking. Users are expected to take responsibility for secure configuration and credential management.
  - DESIGN: It is assumed that fastlane follows a modular design with a core engine and plugin architecture. Credential management is abstracted to some extent. Deployment is primarily focused on developer workstations and CI/CD environments. Build process involves standard software build practices for Ruby gems.
