## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fastlane Configuration Vulnerabilities [**HIGH-RISK PATH**]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fastlane_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Fastfile Modification [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
        *   **Modify Fastfile without Review [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Lack of Code Review Process for Fastfile Changes:** Attackers exploit the absence of code review to introduce malicious changes to the `Fastfile`.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code in Fastfile [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Inject malicious Ruby code [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Directly embed malicious Ruby code within the `Fastfile` to be executed during Fastlane runs.
            *   **Modify existing Fastlane actions to execute malicious commands [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Alter existing Fastlane actions to execute arbitrary system commands or malicious scripts.
    *   **Environment Variable Manipulation [**HIGH-RISK PATH**]:**
        *   **Compromise CI/CD Environment [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Modify the CI/CD pipeline definition to inject malicious environment variables or alter Fastlane execution flow.
            *   **Steal CI/CD Credentials [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Obtain CI/CD credentials to gain unauthorized access and control over the CI/CD environment.
            *   **Inject Malicious Environment Variables [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
                *   **Modify CI/CD pipeline definition [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** As above, modify pipeline definition to inject variables.
                *   **Gain access to server running Fastlane [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Directly access the server where Fastlane runs and modify environment variables.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Configuration [**HIGH-RISK PATH**]:**
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets in Fastfile [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Developer mistakenly commits secrets directly into Fastfile [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive secrets directly within the `Fastfile` and commit it to the repository.
        *   **Secrets Stored Insecurely in Environment Variables [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Secrets exposed in CI/CD logs or server environment [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Secrets stored as environment variables are logged in CI/CD systems or are accessible in the server environment without proper protection.
    *   **Insecure Plugin/Gem Management [**HIGH-RISK PATH**]:**
        *   **Use Vulnerable Fastlane Plugins [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Exploit known vulnerabilities in plugins:** Utilize publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure Fastlane plugins to compromise the Fastlane execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fastlane Execution Vulnerabilities [**HIGH-RISK PATH**]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fastlane_execution_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection via Fastlane Actions [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
        *   **Vulnerable Fastlane Action [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Action susceptible to command injection due to insecure input handling [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Identify and target Fastlane actions (custom or community-provided) that do not properly sanitize user-controlled input, making them vulnerable to command injection.
        *   **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server [**CRITICAL NODE**]:**
            *   **Command injection allows execution of system commands [**CRITICAL NODE**]:** Successfully exploit the command injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary system commands on the server running Fastlane, gaining control over the system.
