#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated and Impact Assessment

The mitigation strategy effectively addresses the identified threats:

*   **Environment Variable Exposure of `fastlane` Secrets (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. By migrating secrets to a secure vault and retrieving them dynamically, the strategy completely eliminates the reliance on environment variables for storing sensitive `fastlane` credentials. Vaults provide encryption at rest and in transit, significantly reducing the risk of exposure compared to environment variables which are often stored in plain text in CI/CD configurations and process memory.
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Medium to High**.  The risk of accidental or malicious exposure of secrets through environment variables is drastically reduced.

*   **Secret Sprawl and Management Complexity for `fastlane` (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium to High**. Centralizing secrets in a vault provides a single source of truth for `fastlane` credentials. Vaults offer features for organizing, versioning, and managing secrets, simplifying secret management compared to scattered environment variables across different systems and configurations.
