# Threat Model Analysis for fastlane/fastlane

## Threat: [Hardcoded Credentials in `Fastfile` or related configuration files.](./threats/hardcoded_credentials_in__fastfile__or_related_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Hardcoded Credentials in `Fastfile` or related configuration files.
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inspect the `Fastfile` or other configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `Appfile`) within the project's codebase or build artifacts to find plaintext credentials such as API keys, signing certificate passwords, or app store connect credentials. They could then use these credentials to access sensitive resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to app stores, code signing infrastructure, and other sensitive services. This could lead to the distribution of malicious app updates, theft of app data, or financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Fastfile`, `Appfile`, `.env` files, any custom Ruby scripts used by Fastlane.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize environment variables for storing sensitive information.
        *   Employ dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Fastlane.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive data directly to version control.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files.

## Threat: [Accidental Committing of Sensitive Information to Version Control.](./threats/accidental_committing_of_sensitive_information_to_version_control.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Committing of Sensitive Information to Version Control.
    *   **Description:** A developer might mistakenly commit sensitive data within Fastlane configuration files to the project's Git repository. If the repository is public or if an attacker gains access to the repository's history, they can retrieve these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Historical exposure of credentials, even if later removed, can be exploited.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Fastfile`, `Appfile`, `.env` files, any custom Ruby scripts used by Fastlane, Git repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive files from being committed.
        *   Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets.
        *   Regularly audit the Git history for accidentally committed secrets and remove them using tools like `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`.
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices.

## Threat: [Malicious or Compromised Fastlane Plugins.](./threats/malicious_or_compromised_fastlane_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Compromised Fastlane Plugins.
    *   **Description:** An attacker could create a malicious Fastlane plugin or compromise an existing one. If the application's Fastlane configuration uses this plugin, the attacker's code will be executed within the Fastlane environment, potentially stealing credentials, modifying build artifacts, or performing other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromised builds, supply chain attacks, unauthorized access to connected services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastlane plugin system, specific Fastlane actions provided by the plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit the source code of any third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Prefer well-established and reputable plugins with active maintenance.
        *   Use specific version pinning for plugins in the `Gemfile` to avoid unexpected updates.
        *   Regularly check for updates and security advisories for used plugins.
        *   Consider creating internal, audited plugins for sensitive tasks.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Fastlane Plugins.](./threats/vulnerable_fastlane_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Fastlane Plugins.
    *   **Description:** A Fastlane plugin might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure dependencies) that an attacker could exploit if they gain control over the Fastlane execution environment or can influence the plugin's inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service within the Fastlane execution context.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Fastlane actions provided by the vulnerable plugin, the plugin's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Fastlane and its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used plugins.
        *   Consider static and dynamic analysis of plugin code if feasible.
        *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the plugin maintainers.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks on Plugin Dependencies.](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks_on_plugin_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks on Plugin Dependencies.
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the plugin dependency resolution process (e.g., in RubyGems) to inject malicious dependencies that are used by Fastlane plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious plugins, this can lead to compromised builds, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastlane plugin dependency management (Bundler), RubyGems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency management best practices, including verifying checksums and using private gem repositories if necessary.
        *   Monitor dependency updates and security advisories.
        *   Employ tools that detect dependency confusion vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Signing Certificates and Provisioning Profiles.](./threats/insecure_storage_of_signing_certificates_and_provisioning_profiles.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Signing Certificates and Provisioning Profiles.
    *   **Description:** Fastlane often interacts with signing certificates and provisioning profiles. If these are stored insecurely in the context of Fastlane's usage (e.g., accessible by Fastlane without proper authorization or stored in a way that Fastlane's actions expose them), an attacker gaining access could steal them and use them to sign malicious applications as if they were legitimate.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized code signing, potential for distributing malicious applications under the legitimate developer's identity, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastlane actions related to code signing (e.g., `match`, `cert`, `sigh`), keychain access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Fastlane `match` with a secure Git repository for storing certificates and profiles.
        *   Encrypt the repository used by `match`.
        *   Restrict access to the repository containing signing materials.

## Threat: [Compromised Fastlane Installation.](./threats/compromised_fastlane_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Fastlane Installation.
    *   **Description:** If the Fastlane installation itself is compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack on the RubyGems repository), all subsequent Fastlane executions could be malicious, potentially injecting malware or stealing credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of all projects using the compromised Fastlane installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Fastlane gem and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted and official sources for installing Fastlane.
        *   Verify the integrity of the Fastlane gem using checksums.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to Fastlane and its dependencies.
