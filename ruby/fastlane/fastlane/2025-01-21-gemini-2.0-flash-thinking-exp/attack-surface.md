# Attack Surface Analysis for fastlane/fastlane

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_storage.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Credential Storage**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive credentials (API keys, signing certificates, passwords) required by Fastlane are stored insecurely within configuration files (e.g., `Fastfile`, `Appfile`) or environment variables.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane relies on these credentials to automate tasks like building, signing, and deploying applications. The configuration files and environment variables are common places to store these for Fastlane's use.
    *   **Example:** API keys for accessing app stores are directly written in plaintext within the `Fastfile` and committed to a public Git repository.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to these credentials can lead to account compromise, unauthorized app releases, data breaches, and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure credential management solutions like password managers (e.g., 1Password, LastPass) or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid committing sensitive credentials directly to version control.
        *   Use environment variables cautiously and ensure the environment is secure.
        *   Leverage Fastlane's built-in features for handling sensitive data, such as the `dotenv` integration or keychain access.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files and the environment where Fastlane runs.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Plugin Execution**
    *   **Description:** Fastlane's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. However, using untrusted or compromised plugins can introduce malicious code into the build and deployment process.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane's design encourages the use of plugins to automate various tasks. This reliance on external code increases the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful Fastlane plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin contains code that steals build artifacts or injects malware into the application.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, injection of malware into the application, theft of sensitive data, and compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Thoroughly review the source code of plugins before installation.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for vetting and approving new plugins before they are used in the project.
        *   Use plugin managers that provide security checks or vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Surface: [`Fastfile` Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/_fastfile__code_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: `Fastfile` Code Injection**
    *   **Description:** The `Fastfile` is a Ruby script that defines the Fastlane workflow. If an attacker can modify this file, they can inject malicious code that will be executed by Fastlane.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** The `Fastfile` is the central configuration for Fastlane, making it a prime target for attackers seeking to control the automation process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the repository and modifies the `Fastfile` to include a command that uploads sensitive build artifacts to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, manipulation of the build process, theft of sensitive data, and potential compromise of the deployed application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the repository containing the `Fastfile`.
        *   Utilize code review processes for any changes to the `Fastfile`.
        *   Employ integrity checks to ensure the `Fastfile` has not been tampered with.
        *   Run Fastlane in a controlled and isolated environment to limit the impact of potential malicious code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Fastlane Actions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_fastlane_actions.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Command Injection through Fastlane Actions**
    *   **Description:** Some Fastlane actions execute shell commands. If user-supplied input or data from external sources is not properly sanitized before being used in these commands, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane's automation often involves interacting with external tools and systems through shell commands, increasing the risk of command injection if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:** A Fastlane action takes a user-provided app version as input and uses it in a shell command without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running Fastlane, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using shell commands directly within Fastlane actions whenever possible.
        *   Utilize Fastlane's built-in methods and parameters for interacting with external tools.
        *   If shell commands are necessary, meticulously sanitize and validate all user-supplied input and data from external sources before using it in commands.
        *   Employ parameterized commands or use libraries that prevent command injection.
