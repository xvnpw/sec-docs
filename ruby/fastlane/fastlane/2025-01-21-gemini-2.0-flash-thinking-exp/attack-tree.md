## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

*   **Compromise Application via Fastlane:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the target application.
*   **Tamper with Fastlane Configuration:**  Gaining the ability to modify Fastlane's configuration files (like the `Fastfile`) grants the attacker significant control over the deployment process. This allows for injecting malicious code, altering deployment logic, or exfiltrating sensitive information.
*   **Modify Fastfile:** The `Fastfile` is the central configuration file for Fastlane. Compromising it allows for direct manipulation of the deployment workflow.
*   **Manipulate Environment Variables:** Environment variables often store sensitive information like API keys and credentials. Controlling these variables allows attackers to impersonate legitimate services or redirect deployments.
*   **Exploit Insecure Storage of Fastlane Configuration:** If sensitive information like credentials or API keys are stored insecurely within Fastlane configuration files, attackers with access can easily retrieve them.
*   **Steal Credentials Managed by Fastlane:** Successfully stealing credentials used by Fastlane provides attackers with the ability to access protected resources and potentially escalate their privileges.
*   **Exploit Insecure Credential Management Practices:** This represents a systemic weakness where developers are not following secure practices for handling credentials, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Manipulate the Deployment Process:**  Gaining control over the deployment process allows attackers to deploy malicious versions of the application, bypassing security checks and potentially affecting end-users.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Code into Lanes:** Attackers inject malicious code into the `Fastfile`'s lanes, which are sequences of actions executed by Fastlane. This code can perform various malicious activities during the deployment process.
*   **Introduce Backdoor Functionality:** Attackers add code to the `Fastfile` or custom actions that creates backdoors in the deployed application, allowing for persistent unauthorized access.
*   **Alter Deployment Logic:** Attackers modify the `Fastfile` to change the intended deployment process, such as redirecting build artifacts to attacker-controlled servers or injecting malicious dependencies.
    *   **Inject Malicious Dependencies:**  Attackers modify the `Fastfile` or use actions to introduce vulnerable or malicious dependencies into the application's build process.
*   **Inject Malicious Values for Sensitive Variables -> Override API Keys or Credentials:** Attackers manipulate environment variables used by Fastlane to inject malicious values, such as overriding legitimate API keys with attacker-controlled ones.
*   **Introduce Malicious Custom Plugins:** Attackers, particularly insiders, create and introduce malicious custom Fastlane plugins that execute unauthorized actions during the deployment process.
*   **Exploit Insecure Storage of Fastlane Configuration -> Access Stored Credentials in Plaintext / API Keys or Tokens:** Attackers exploit the insecure storage of credentials or API keys within Fastlane configuration files to gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Access Credentials Stored in Environment Variables -> Exploit Insufficient Access Controls on CI/CD Environment:** Attackers exploit weak access controls on the CI/CD environment where Fastlane runs to access environment variables containing sensitive credentials.
*   **Exploit Insecure Credential Management Practices -> Hardcoded Credentials in Fastfile or Plugins / Credentials Stored in Version Control:** Attackers exploit the practice of developers hardcoding credentials directly in the `Fastfile` or plugins, or accidentally committing them to version control systems.
*   **Inject Malicious Code During Build Process -> Modify Build Scripts Executed by Fastlane:** Attackers modify build scripts that are executed by Fastlane during the application's build process to inject malicious code into the final application.
