# Threat Model Analysis for fastlane/fastlane

## Threat: [Malicious Fastlane Plugin (Spoofing/Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/malicious_fastlane_plugin__spoofingelevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Fastlane plugin to RubyGems, mimicking a legitimate plugin (typosquatting) or offering seemingly useful functionality. The plugin contains code that steals credentials, injects malicious code into the build process, or escalates privileges on the build system. The attacker might use social engineering to convince developers to install the plugin.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of app store credentials, leading to unauthorized app releases or modifications.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the application, potentially affecting end-users.
        *   Compromise of the build server or developer workstation.
        *   Data exfiltration (source code, user data, etc.).
    *   **Fastlane Component Affected:** Fastlane plugin system (`fastlane/plugins`), specifically the installation and execution of third-party plugins. The `PluginManager` class within Fastlane is a key area of concern.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (official Fastlane plugins or well-known community plugins with a strong reputation).
        *   **Source Code Review:** If possible, review the source code of the plugin before installation. Look for suspicious code, obfuscation, or network connections.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** If the plugin provider offers checksums (e.g., SHA-256), verify the downloaded plugin against the provided checksum.
        *   **Plugin Isolation:** Consider running Fastlane within a container (e.g., Docker) to limit the potential damage a malicious plugin could cause.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or are from untrusted sources.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to manage plugin dependencies and ensure consistent versions.

## Threat: [`Fastfile` Tampering (Tampering)](./threats/_fastfile__tampering__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the source code repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a vulnerability in the repository hosting service) and modifies the `Fastfile`. They could add malicious actions, change build settings, redirect deployments to a malicious server, or steal credentials stored insecurely within the `Fastfile`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Deployment of a malicious version of the application.
        *   Exposure of sensitive data (if credentials are hardcoded in the `Fastfile`).
        *   Disruption of the build and deployment process.
        *   Unauthorized access to app store accounts.
    *   **Fastlane Component Affected:** The `Fastfile` itself, which is the core configuration file for Fastlane. Any action or lane defined within the `Fastfile` could be affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strong access controls on the source code repository. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all developer accounts.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Require code reviews (pull requests) for all changes to the `Fastfile`. At least two developers should review any changes.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a robust version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the `Fastfile` and allow for easy rollback to previous versions.
        *   **CI/CD Integration:** Use a CI/CD system that clones a fresh copy of the repository for each build, preventing persistent modifications on the build server.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the `Fastfile` for any unauthorized changes or suspicious code.
        *   **Secrets Management:** *Never* hardcode credentials in the `Fastfile`. Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Logs (Information Disclosure)](./threats/credential_exposure_in_logs__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** Fastlane actions, especially those interacting with external services (e.g., `match`, `deliver`, `pilot`), might inadvertently log sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or session tokens to the console or log files. This can happen if the actions are not configured correctly or if they have verbose logging enabled. An attacker with access to the build server logs or CI/CD logs could extract these credentials.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of app store accounts, testing services, or other third-party services.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Fastlane Component Affected:** Any Fastlane action that interacts with external services and handles sensitive data. Specific actions like `match`, `deliver`, `pilot`, `gym`, `scan`, and any custom actions that use credentials are at risk. The logging mechanism within Fastlane itself is also a factor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive data, and ensure that Fastlane actions are configured to read credentials from these variables.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Integrate Fastlane with a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve credentials.
        *   **Log Redaction:** Use log redaction tools or techniques to automatically mask sensitive data in logs. Fastlane's `hide_sensitive` option can help, but may not catch everything.
        *   **Careful Configuration:** Review the documentation for each Fastlane action to understand how it handles sensitive data and configure it appropriately.
        *   **Log Rotation and Access Control:** Implement log rotation and strict access controls on log files to limit the exposure of sensitive data.
        *   **CI/CD Configuration:** Configure your CI/CD system to avoid printing sensitive environment variables to the build logs.

## Threat: [`match` Repository Compromise (Tampering/Information Disclosure)](./threats/_match__repository_compromise__tamperinginformation_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** If using `fastlane match` for code signing, the Git repository storing the encrypted certificates and profiles is compromised. An attacker gains access to the decryption key (stored as an environment variable or in a secrets manager) and the repository itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   The attacker can decrypt and use the code signing certificates and provisioning profiles, allowing them to sign malicious applications that appear to be from the legitimate developer.
        *   This can lead to widespread distribution of malware.
    *   **Fastlane Component Affected:** Specifically the `match` action and the associated Git repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Repository Security:** Use a private Git repository with strict access controls (MFA, limited user access).
        *   **Secure Key Storage:** Store the `match` decryption key securely using a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). *Never* hardcode the key in the `Fastfile` or commit it to the repository.
        *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Rotate the `match` decryption key periodically.
        *   **Monitor Repository Activity:** Monitor the Git repository for any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access or modifications.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** Explore alternatives to `match` that might offer better security, such as using Apple's managed code signing.

## Threat: [Excessive Permissions (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/excessive_permissions__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** Fastlane is run with unnecessarily high privileges on the build server or developer workstation (e.g., as root or administrator). A vulnerability in Fastlane or one of its plugins could be exploited to gain full control of the system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise.
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Installation of malware.
    *   **Fastlane Component Affected:** The entire Fastlane toolchain.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Fastlane with the minimum necessary privileges. Create a dedicated user account for Fastlane on the build server with only the permissions it needs.
        *   **Containerization:** Run Fastlane within a container (e.g., Docker) to isolate it from the host system.
        *   **Avoid Root/Admin:** Never run Fastlane as root or administrator unless absolutely necessary.
