# Attack Surface Analysis for fastlane/fastlane

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure (Fastlane-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure__fastlane-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used by Fastlane to interact with external services, specifically due to misconfiguration or mishandling *within* Fastlane's context.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane's core function requires these credentials, and its configuration files (`Fastfile`, environment variables) are common points of failure.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits an API key for the Google Play Console to a Git repository *within the `Fastfile`* or includes it in a publicly visible `.env` file used by Fastlane.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker gains access to the developer's accounts, allowing them to publish malicious apps, modify existing apps, access user data, or incur financial costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** hardcode credentials in `Fastfile` or any other version-controlled files.
        *   Use a secure secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
        *   Use environment variables *securely* (loaded from a secrets manager or a `.env` file that is *explicitly excluded* from version control and handled securely during CI/CD).
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
        *   Implement least privilege principles for service accounts *used by Fastlane*.

## Attack Surface: [`match` Repository Compromise](./attack_surfaces/_match__repository_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Git repository used by Fastlane's `match` to store encrypted code signing identities and provisioning profiles. This is a *direct* attack on a Fastlane component.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** `match` is a Fastlane-specific tool, and its security is directly tied to Fastlane's secure usage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the SSH key or personal access token used to access the private `match` repository, or compromises the machine where the decrypted `match` repository is checked out.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can obtain signing certificates and provisioning profiles, allowing them to sign malicious applications that appear legitimate.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Protect the `match` repository with strong access controls (multi-factor authentication, IP whitelisting).  This is a *direct* mitigation for a Fastlane component.
        *   Use a strong, unique passphrase for encrypting the `match` repository and store it securely (secrets manager). This passphrase is *directly* related to Fastlane's `match`.
        *   Regularly rotate the credentials (SSH key or personal access token) used to access the `match` repository.
        *   Monitor the repository for unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Fastlane Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_fastlane_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in *third-party Fastlane plugins*.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane's plugin architecture is the *direct* enabler of this risk.
    *   **Example:** A Fastlane plugin used for uploading builds to a third-party testing service contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server *through the plugin's actions*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin's functionality, but could range from credential theft (specifically those used by *the plugin*) to complete system compromise *via the plugin's execution*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all Fastlane plugins before use. Review source code (if available), check reputation, and research known vulnerabilities. This is *directly* related to Fastlane's plugin ecosystem.
        *   Use a `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to pin plugin versions and ensure consistent builds. This manages Fastlane's dependencies.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a private gem server to host vetted plugins *for Fastlane*.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `sh` Action](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__sh__action.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious shell commands through Fastlane's `sh` action due to improper input validation *within a Fastfile*.
    *   **How Fastlane Contributes:** The `sh` action is a *core Fastlane feature*, and its misuse is a direct Fastlane-related vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A `Fastfile` script takes a user-provided filename as input and uses it directly in an `sh` command without sanitization. An attacker provides a filename containing shell metacharacters.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the build server *via Fastlane's execution*, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or credential theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Always* validate and sanitize any external input used within `sh` commands *within the Fastfile*.
        *   Use parameterized commands or shell escaping functions to prevent command injection.
        *   Avoid using `sh` when a dedicated Fastlane action exists for the same purpose. Prefer built-in Fastlane actions. This is a *direct* recommendation for using Fastlane securely.

## Attack Surface: [Over-Privileged Fastlane Setup](./attack_surfaces/over-privileged_fastlane_setup.md)

* **Description:** Fastlane or associated service accounts are granted excessive permissions.
    * **How Fastlane Contributes:** Fastlane's configuration determines the permissions it has. Overly permissive configurations increase the blast radius of a compromise.
    * **Example:** Fastlane is configured with full administrative access to an AWS account, rather than just the permissions needed to deploy the application.
    * **Impact:** A compromise of Fastlane's credentials could lead to widespread damage within the cloud environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   Grant Fastlane and its service accounts only the minimum permissions required.
        *   Regularly review and audit permissions.
        *   Use IAM roles and policies (or equivalent) to manage permissions granularly.
