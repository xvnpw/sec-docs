*   **Threat:** API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Actions on External Services
    *   **Description:** If API keys *used by Fastlane* to interact with external services are compromised (e.g., through exposed environment variables or insecure storage *accessible to Fastlane*), an attacker could use these keys to perform unauthorized actions on those services, such as submitting malicious app updates or accessing sensitive data *through Fastlane's integrations*.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious app updates *deployed via Fastlane*, data breaches on connected services *accessed by Fastlane*, financial losses due to unauthorized usage *through Fastlane's actions*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Actions interacting with external APIs, credential management within Fastlane.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage API keys using dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Restrict the permissions associated with API keys to the minimum necessary.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Build Environment (Directly impacting Fastlane)
    *   **Description:** If the machine or environment where Fastlane is executed is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the build process *orchestrated by Fastlane*, steal sensitive information handled by Fastlane, or inject malicious code into the application *through Fastlane's build steps*.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware into the application *built and deployed by Fastlane*, leakage of signing certificates or other sensitive data *managed by or accessible to Fastlane*, disruption of the build and deployment process *managed by Fastlane*.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Fastlane execution environment (including the machine, operating system, and installed software) *as it directly impacts Fastlane's operation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the build environment by applying security patches and updates regularly.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the build environment.
        *   Use containerization or virtual machines to isolate the build environment *where Fastlane runs*.
        *   Employ endpoint security solutions (e.g., antivirus, intrusion detection) on the build machine.

#### High Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Modification of `Fastfile`
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the project repository or the development environment could modify the `Fastfile` to inject malicious code, alter the build process (e.g., including backdoors), or exfiltrate sensitive data during the build or deployment process *managed by Fastlane*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised application builds *orchestrated by Fastlane*, distribution of malware to users *through Fastlane's deployment*, leakage of sensitive information from the build environment or the application itself *handled by Fastlane*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Fastfile`, Fastlane core execution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for the project repository and development environment.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all changes to the `Fastfile`.
        *   Employ version control for the `Fastfile` and track changes.
        *   Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of the `Fastfile`.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious plugin with a name similar to a legitimate one, hoping that developers will mistakenly install the malicious version *into their Fastlane setup*. This malicious plugin could then execute arbitrary code or steal sensitive information during the Fastlane execution.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware or backdoors into the application build process *through a compromised Fastlane plugin*, theft of sensitive credentials or data handled by Fastlane *via the malicious plugin*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastlane plugin installation mechanism (`fastlane add_plugin`), plugin resolution.
