## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Attack Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data via Kaminari Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__attack_goal_gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_data_via_kaminari_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. They aim to leverage vulnerabilities related to Kaminari pagination to access data they are not authorized to view.
    *   **Risk Level:** Critical. Successful achievement of this goal represents a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Parameter Tampering in Pagination [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_parameter_tampering_in_pagination__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to manipulate URL parameters associated with Kaminari pagination, specifically `page` and `per_page`, to alter the application's behavior and potentially gain unauthorized access or cause disruption.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Manipulating the `page` parameter:**  Changing the page number in the URL to access different pages of data.
        *   **Manipulating the `per_page` parameter:**  Changing the number of items displayed per page to retrieve large datasets or cause server overload.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **High Likelihood:** Parameter tampering is a common and easily attempted attack vector in web applications.
        *   **Potentially High Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data access, information disclosure, and Denial of Service.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Requires minimal effort and skill, often just simple URL manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize `page` and `per_page` parameters on the server-side.
        *   **Set Reasonable Limits:** Define and enforce reasonable upper limits for `per_page` to prevent excessive data retrieval and DoS.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the frequency of pagination requests, especially those with large `per_page` values.
        *   **Secure Link Generation:** Ensure pagination links are generated securely and do not introduce other vulnerabilities (like XSS, though less directly related to Kaminari itself).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate 'page' Parameter [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_'page'_parameter__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses specifically on the attack vector of manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `page` number in the URL to navigate through paginated data.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **High Likelihood:** Extremely easy for attackers to attempt.
        *   **Potentially High Impact:** Can lead to bypassing authorization and accessing unintended data.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:**  Requires only basic URL manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Authorization Checks on Every Page:**  Critically important. Re-validate user authorization for every page request, not just the initial request.
        *   **Session Management:** Ensure proper session management to track user authorization across pagination requests.
        *   **Minimize Information Disclosure:** Avoid revealing sensitive metadata through page enumeration (e.g., total page count if it's sensitive).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Data on Unintended Pages [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_data_on_unintended_pages__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The direct consequence of manipulating the `page` parameter. Attackers aim to access data on pages they are not supposed to see.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Navigating to different pages using manipulated `page` parameters, hoping to bypass authorization or access unfiltered data.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **High Likelihood:** Directly follows from easy parameter manipulation.
        *   **High Impact:**  Directly leads to unauthorized data access.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Simple navigation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authorization Logic:** Implement comprehensive authorization logic that is consistently applied across all pages.
        *   **Data Filtering at Query Level:**  Apply authorization and filtering directly within database queries to ensure only authorized and relevant data is retrieved for each page.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Authorization Checks on Paginated Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bypass_authorization_checks_on_paginated_data__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The core vulnerability. Attackers successfully bypass authorization mechanisms when navigating through paginated data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in authorization implementation that fail to properly restrict access to different pages of data. This often occurs when authorization is only checked on the initial request and not on subsequent page navigations.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Medium Likelihood:** Depends on the quality of application's authorization implementation, but common mistake.
        *   **High Impact:** Direct and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Simple page navigation after initial access.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Re-validate Authorization on Each Page Request:**  This is paramount.  Do not assume authorization persists across pagination.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have access to the data they absolutely need.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Specifically test pagination authorization logic during security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate 'per_page' Parameter [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_'per_page'_parameter__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Focuses on the attack vector of manipulating the `per_page` parameter.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Setting a very high `per_page` value:** To cause Denial of Service by overloading the server or database.
        *   **Increasing `per_page`:** To reveal more data on a single page than intended, potentially leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Medium Likelihood:** Easy to attempt if input validation is weak or missing.
        *   **Medium Impact:** Can lead to Denial of Service or increased information disclosure.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Simple URL manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation for `per_page`:**  Validate and sanitize the `per_page` parameter.
        *   **Enforce Maximum `per_page` Limit:** Set a reasonable upper limit and reject requests exceeding it.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server and database resources for unusual spikes in load related to pagination requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inadequate Authorization Checks in Paginated Queries [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inadequate_authorization_checks_in_paginated_queries__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Highlights logic flaws in the application's implementation where authorization checks are insufficient within the paginated queries themselves.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting situations where authorization is checked *before* pagination logic is applied, but not *within* the query that retrieves data for each page. This allows attackers to bypass authorization by navigating to subsequent pages.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Medium Likelihood:** Common mistake in pagination implementation, especially when developers focus on UI-level authorization but neglect backend query-level checks.
        *   **High Impact:** Direct bypass of authorization and access to unauthorized data.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Simple page navigation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Integrate Authorization into Data Retrieval:**  Ensure authorization logic is deeply integrated into the data retrieval process for each page.
        *   **Query-Level Authorization:**  Ideally, implement authorization at the database query level to filter results based on user permissions *before* pagination is applied.
        *   **Consistent Authorization Application:**  Verify that authorization is consistently applied across all pages and pagination operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Authorization by Navigating Pages [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bypass_authorization_by_navigating_pages__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The direct consequence of inadequate authorization checks in paginated queries. Attackers successfully bypass authorization simply by navigating to different pages.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Navigating through pages of data, exploiting the lack of re-authorization checks on subsequent page requests.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Medium Likelihood:** Directly follows from inadequate authorization checks.
        *   **High Impact:** Direct unauthorized data access.
        *   **Low Effort & Skill Level:** Simple page navigation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **All Mitigation Strategies for "Inadequate Authorization Checks in Paginated Queries" apply here.**  Focus on robust, query-level authorization and re-validation on every page request.
