                       application's authorization, the attacker might access data
                       they shouldn't see by manipulating `page`.)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Excessive `per_page` Value [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__excessive__per_page__value__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to overwhelm the application by requesting an extremely large number of records per page. This is done by setting the `per_page` parameter to a very high value (e.g., `per_page=1000000`).
*   **Why it's High Risk:**
    *   **Ease of Execution:**  Extremely easy to perform; requires only modifying a URL parameter.
    *   **High Impact:** Can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, database connections).  The application becomes unresponsive or unavailable.
    *   **Common Attack:**  A very common and well-known attack vector against applications with pagination.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict `max_per_page` Limit:**  Kaminari provides a `max_per_page` configuration option.  *Use it*.  Set a reasonable maximum value (e.g., 100, 200) that balances usability with security.  This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Ensure the `per_page` parameter is an integer and within the allowed range.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Defense-in-Depth):**  Consider rate limiting to prevent attackers from making repeated requests with large `per_page` values.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Bypassing Scope/Filters [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/7__bypassing_scopefilters__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the `page` parameter (or other parameters if custom paginators are involved) to access data that they should not be authorized to see. This occurs when the application's authorization logic is not properly integrated with Kaminari's scoping mechanism. The attacker essentially "jumps" to pages containing data they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Why it's High Risk:**
    *   **Severe Impact:**  Leads directly to data exfiltration, potentially exposing sensitive user data or other confidential information.
    *   **Subtle Vulnerability:**  Can be difficult to detect without a thorough understanding of the application's authorization and data access patterns.
    *   **Common Misconfiguration:**  Often arises from a misunderstanding of how Kaminari's scoping interacts with authorization.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Authorization *Within* the Scope:**  The *most crucial* mitigation.  Ensure that the authorization checks are performed *within* the scope used by Kaminari for pagination.  For example:
        ```ruby
        # GOOD (Authorization within the scope)
        @posts = Post.visible_to(current_user).page(params[:page]).per(params[:per_page])

        # BAD (Authorization before the scope - VULNERABLE)
        @posts = Post.all.page(params[:page]).per(params[:per_page])
        # ... then check authorization later (too late!) ...
        ```
        The `visible_to` method (or equivalent) should restrict the data to only what the `current_user` is allowed to see *before* pagination is applied.
    *   **Defense-in-Depth (Authorization *After* Pagination):**  While the scope should handle the primary authorization, adding an additional check *after* pagination can provide an extra layer of security. This can catch edge cases or errors in the scoping logic.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Include security tests that specifically try to bypass authorization by manipulating pagination parameters.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code that handles pagination and authorization to ensure they are correctly integrated.
