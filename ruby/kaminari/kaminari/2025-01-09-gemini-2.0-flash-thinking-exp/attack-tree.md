## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Parameter Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__exploit_parameter_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This critical node represents the attacker's ability to influence the application's behavior by manipulating the parameters used for pagination. This is a common entry point for various attacks.

* **High-Risk Path: Bypass Pagination Limits via Invalid Per-Page Value:**
    * **Attack Vector: Craft Request with Extremely Large Per-Page Value:**
        * **Details:** An attacker sends a request with an exceptionally large value for the `per_page` parameter.
        * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to the application attempting to retrieve and process an enormous amount of data, potentially causing:
            * **Resource Exhaustion (DoS):** The server's memory, CPU, or database resources can be overwhelmed, leading to a denial of service.
            * **Memory Issues:** The application might run out of memory trying to handle the large dataset.
            * **Database Overload:** The database server could struggle to execute the query, impacting performance for all users.
            * **Potential Data Leakage:** In some cases, if the application doesn't handle this scenario gracefully, it might inadvertently expose more data than intended.

* **High-Risk Path: Type Confusion/Exploitation:**
    * **Attack Vector: Provide Non-Integer Values for Page or Per-Page Parameters:**
        * **Details:** An attacker sends requests with non-integer values (e.g., strings, special characters) for the `page` or `per_page` parameters.
        * **Potential Impact:**
            * **Application Errors:** If the application doesn't properly validate the input type, it can lead to errors, exceptions, and potentially application crashes.
            * **Potential Code Execution:** In poorly written applications or frameworks with vulnerabilities, this type of input could be used to trigger unexpected code paths or even lead to remote code execution if the input is used unsafely in backend operations (though less directly related to Kaminari itself).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Link Generation Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__exploit_link_generation_logic__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application generates and renders the pagination links.

* **High-Risk Path: Manipulate Generated Pagination Links:**
    * **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code into Link Attributes (e.g., JavaScript):**
        * **Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly escaped by the application:**
            * **Details:** If the application directly embeds data provided by Kaminari (like page numbers in the `href` attribute) into the HTML without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these attributes.
            * **Potential Impact:**
                * **Account Takeover:** The injected script can steal user cookies or session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
                * **Data Theft:** The script can access and send sensitive data from the user's browser to the attacker.
                * **Malicious Actions:** The script can perform actions on behalf of the user, such as changing settings, making purchases, or spreading malware.
                * **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the page seen by the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE][HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Application-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__high_risk_path__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__application-specific_.md)

**Description:** This critical node highlights risks associated with how the application configures and integrates Kaminari.

* **High-Risk Path: Insecure Integration with Application Logic:**
    * **Critical Node: Relying Solely on Kaminari for Authorization/Access Control:**
        * **Attack Vector: Bypass pagination to access unauthorized data:**
            * **Details:** If the application mistakenly relies solely on Kaminari's pagination to restrict access to data (e.g., assuming that a user can only access data on the current page), an attacker can manipulate the `page` or `per_page` parameters to bypass these artificial limitations and access data they are not authorized to see.
            * **Potential Impact:**
                * **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information that should be restricted.
                * **Data Breach:**  Large amounts of confidential data could be exposed.
                * **Violation of Business Logic:** Attackers can perform actions or access data in ways not intended by the application's design.
