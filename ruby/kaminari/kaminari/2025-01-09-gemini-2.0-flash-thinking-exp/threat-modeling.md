# Threat Model Analysis for kaminari/kaminari

## Threat: [Unbounded Page Access leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unbounded_page_access_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might maliciously craft URLs with extremely high `page` parameter values. Kaminari, upon receiving these requests, triggers logic that can lead to inefficient database queries or excessive memory usage as it calculates offsets and potentially attempts to fetch data for non-existent pages.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or degraded application performance due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, database load). The server might become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kaminari's core pagination logic, specifically the methods that calculate offsets based on the `page` and `per_page` parameters within the controller integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation on the `page` parameter before it's passed to Kaminari, ensuring it's a positive integer within a reasonable range.
        *   Set a maximum allowed page number based on the total number of items and the `per_page` setting. Prevent Kaminari from processing requests exceeding this limit.
        *   Optimize database queries that Kaminari triggers to efficiently handle pagination and avoid performance bottlenecks for out-of-bounds requests.

## Threat: [Manipulation of `per_page` Parameter for Resource Exhaustion](./threats/manipulation_of__per_page__parameter_for_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to control the `per_page` parameter, an attacker could set it to an excessively large value. Kaminari would then instruct the application to fetch and potentially render a huge number of records on a single page.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or degraded application performance due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, bandwidth). The server might struggle to process and render the large dataset, leading to slow response times or crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kaminari's configuration and the logic that uses the `per_page` value to limit the number of items per page within the controller integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid exposing the `per_page` parameter directly to users if not absolutely necessary.
        *   If the `per_page` parameter is exposed, implement strict input validation before it's used by Kaminari to ensure it's a positive integer within a predefined, reasonable range.
        *   Set a maximum allowed value for `per_page` in the application's configuration that Kaminari respects.
