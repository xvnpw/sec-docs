# Attack Surface Analysis for kaminari/kaminari

## Attack Surface: [Direct Manipulation of `per_page` Parameter (If Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/direct_manipulation_of__per_page__parameter__if_exposed_.md)

* **Description:** If the application exposes the number of items displayed per page as a user-controllable `per_page` parameter, attackers can manipulate this value to request an excessive number of items.
    * **How Kaminari Contributes:** Kaminari allows configuration of the `per_page` value. If the application passes user-supplied input directly to Kaminari's `per_page` setting without proper validation, it creates this attack surface.
    * **Example:** An attacker changes the URL from `/items?per_page=10` to `/items?per_page=99999`.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Denial of Service (Critical):** Requesting an extremely large number of items per page can overwhelm the database and application server, leading to significant performance degradation or a complete service outage.
        * **Resource Exhaustion (High):** Retrieving and processing a massive number of records can consume excessive memory, CPU, and network bandwidth, potentially crashing the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Restrict `per_page` Values:**  Define a strict, limited set of allowed `per_page` values on the server-side. Do not allow arbitrary user input for this parameter. Use a dropdown or a predefined set of options.
        * **Server-side Validation:** If user-defined `per_page` is absolutely necessary, implement rigorous server-side validation to ensure it falls within tightly controlled, safe limits.
        * **Ignore or Sanitize Input:** If an invalid or excessively large `per_page` value is provided, either ignore it and use a default value or sanitize it to a safe maximum.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in Custom Kaminari Implementations](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_custom_kaminari_implementations.md)

* **Description:** Developers might introduce vulnerabilities when creating custom link renderers or other extensions to Kaminari's functionality.
    * **How Kaminari Contributes:** Kaminari provides flexibility for customization. If these customizations involve handling user input or generating output without proper security considerations, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A custom link renderer directly embeds unsanitized user input into the generated pagination links, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (Critical):** If custom renderers improperly handle user input, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially stealing user credentials or performing other malicious actions.
        * **Authorization Bypass (High):**  In poorly designed custom logic, it might be possible to manipulate pagination in a way that bypasses intended authorization checks, granting access to unauthorized data.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles when developing custom Kaminari components. Avoid directly embedding user input into output without proper sanitization and encoding.
        * **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly validate any user input processed within custom Kaminari logic and properly encode output to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of custom Kaminari implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Use Established and Secure Libraries:** When possible, leverage well-vetted and secure libraries for common tasks within custom renderers to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
