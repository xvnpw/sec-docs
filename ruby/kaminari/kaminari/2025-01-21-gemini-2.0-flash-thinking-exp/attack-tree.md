## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with 'page' parameter to access data intended for other users or roles.](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_'page'_parameter_to_access_data_intended_for_other_users_or_roles.md)

**Attack Vector:**
* The attacker identifies that the application's authorization logic incorrectly relies solely on the `page` parameter to control access to data.
* By manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL, the attacker attempts to access "pages" of data that are intended for different users, roles, or access levels.
* For example, if user A's data is displayed on `?page=1` and user B's data on `?page=2`, the attacker might try accessing `?page=2` while logged in as user A.
**Critical Node Connection:** This path directly exploits the weakness identified in the "Bypass Access Controls" critical node.
**Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to other users or roles, potentially leading to data breaches, privacy violations, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Link Attributes (Less likely, but possible).](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_link_attributes__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
* The application allows customization of attributes within the pagination links generated by Kaminari.
* The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided data that is used to populate these link attributes.
* The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload within a parameter that influences the link attributes (e.g., a custom title or data attribute).
* When another user clicks on the manipulated pagination link, the malicious script embedded in the attribute is executed in their browser, within the context of the application's origin.
**Critical Node Connection:** This path exploits the potential vulnerabilities within the "Manipulate Generated Pagination Links" critical node.
**Potential Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, theft of sensitive information, and execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigure Kaminari with User-Controlled Data.](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigure_kaminari_with_user-controlled_data.md)

**Attack Vector:**
* The application, due to a design flaw, allows users to directly influence Kaminari's configuration settings. This could be through exposed settings in user profiles, API endpoints, or other means.
* A malicious user exploits this by setting extreme or malicious values for Kaminari's configuration options.
* For example, they might set an extremely low `per_page` value to cause excessive database queries and a denial of service, or they might manipulate other configuration options to cause unexpected behavior or expose sensitive information.
**Critical Node Connection:** This path directly exploits the weakness identified in the "Exploit Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations" critical node.
**Potential Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), resource exhaustion, exposure of internal application details, and potentially other exploits depending on the specific configuration options that can be manipulated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Access Controls (if implemented based on page number).](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_access_controls__if_implemented_based_on_page_number_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application's authorization logic incorrectly relies on the `page` parameter to determine if a user is allowed to access certain data. This is a flawed security design.
**Potential Impact:** If this node is successfully exploited, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Generated Pagination Links.](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_generated_pagination_links.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application or Kaminari's configuration allows for the manipulation of the URLs and attributes within the generated pagination links. This can be exploited if user-provided data is not properly handled.
**Potential Impact:** Successful manipulation can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially compromising user accounts and allowing malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application either relies on insecure default settings of Kaminari or allows for misconfigurations, potentially even by users.
**Potential Impact:** This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including information disclosure due to high default `per_page` values or denial of service if users can set extreme pagination limits.
