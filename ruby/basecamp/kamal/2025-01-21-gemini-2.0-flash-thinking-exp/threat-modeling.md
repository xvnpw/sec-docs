# Threat Model Analysis for basecamp/kamal

## Threat: [Compromised Kamal Host](./threats/compromised_kamal_host.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the machine running the `kamal` command. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, gaining access to user credentials, or through social engineering. Once compromised, the attacker can execute arbitrary `kamal` commands.

**Impact:**  Complete control over deployments, allowing the attacker to deploy malicious code, alter application configurations, disrupt service availability, or exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Affected Kamal Component:** `kamal` CLI, SSH configuration, `deploy.yml`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls on the Kamal host, including multi-factor authentication.
*   Regularly patch the operating system and any software running on the Kamal host.
*   Store SSH keys securely with appropriate permissions.
*   Restrict access to the Kamal host to authorized personnel only.
*   Monitor the Kamal host for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Deployment Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_deployment_credentials.md)

**Description:**  Credentials used by Kamal to access target servers (e.g., SSH private keys, cloud provider API keys) are stored insecurely on the Kamal host. This could involve storing them in plain text files or with overly permissive file permissions. An attacker gaining access to the Kamal host could easily retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to target servers, allowing attackers to deploy malicious code directly, modify server configurations, or access sensitive data stored on those servers.

**Affected Kamal Component:** `kamal` CLI, SSH configuration, potentially `deploy.yml` if credentials are hardcoded (discouraged).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store SSH private keys securely with appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`).
*   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in `deploy.yml`.
*   Consider using SSH agent forwarding or a dedicated secrets management solution if appropriate.
*   Regularly review and rotate deployment credentials.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Deployment Configuration](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_deployment_configuration.md)

**Description:** If user-provided input or external data is directly incorporated into Kamal configuration files (e.g., `deploy.yml`) without proper sanitization or validation, it could lead to command injection or other vulnerabilities during the deployment process orchestrated by Kamal. An attacker could manipulate this input to execute arbitrary commands on the target servers.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on target servers, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Kamal Component:** `kamal` CLI, `deploy.yml`, deployment scripts executed by Kamal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly incorporating user-provided input into Kamal configuration files.
*   If necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining deployment scripts and commands within Kamal's configuration.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys, is configured as environment variables within Kamal's `deploy.yml` and subsequently exposed within the deployed containers. An attacker gaining access to a container or the target server could easily retrieve these secrets.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, or the ability to impersonate the application.

**Affected Kamal Component:** `kamal` CLI, `deploy.yml` (environment variable configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables within `deploy.yml`.
*   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and integrate them with your application deployment process, ensuring Kamal is configured to use them.
*   Consider using Docker secrets for managing sensitive data within containers, ensuring Kamal's deployment process supports their use.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Kamal Codebase](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kamal_codebase.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Kamal itself might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the Kamal host, unauthorized access to deployment configurations managed by Kamal, or denial of service of the deployment process.

**Affected Kamal Component:** `kamal` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Kamal updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor Kamal's release notes and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
*   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Kamal maintainers.
