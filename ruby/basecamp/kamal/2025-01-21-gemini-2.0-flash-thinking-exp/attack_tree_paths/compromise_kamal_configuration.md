    * **Full Disk Encryption:** Enforce full disk encryption on all developer laptops.

**B. Modifying `deploy.yml`:**

* **Description:**  The attacker, having gained access, now aims to alter the `deploy.yml` file to inject malicious configurations.
* **Vulnerabilities:**  Shares the same vulnerabilities as "Gaining Access to `deploy.yml`" as the initial access is often a prerequisite. Additionally:
    * **Lack of Code Review:**  Changes to `deploy.yml` are not subject to thorough code review processes.
    * **Insufficient Branch Protection:**  Lack of branch protection rules on the main branch, allowing direct commits of malicious changes.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**  If the CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys changes from the repository, a compromised pipeline could push malicious configurations.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a developer with commit access into making seemingly innocuous changes that introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:**
    * **Deployment of Malicious Containers:**  Modifying the `image` tag to point to a compromised container image containing malware.
    * **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  Changing volume mounts to expose sensitive data to containers.
    * **Compromise of the Kamal Server:**  Modifying configurations to gain unauthorized access to the Kamal server itself.
    * **Backdoors and Persistence:**  Introducing configurations that create backdoors or persistent access points.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to `deploy.yml`.
    * **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforce branch protection rules on the main branch, requiring pull requests and approvals for changes.
