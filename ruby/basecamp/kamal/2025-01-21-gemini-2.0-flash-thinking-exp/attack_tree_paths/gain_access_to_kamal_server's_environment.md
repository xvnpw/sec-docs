    * **Disable PermitRootLogin:** Prevent direct root login via SSH. Force users to log in with a regular account and then use `sudo` to escalate privileges.
    * **Configure Strong SSH Ciphers and MACs:**  Use secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms in the SSH configuration.
    * **Implement Rate Limiting for SSH:** Use tools like `fail2ban` to block IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts.
    * **Restrict SSH Access:** Use firewalls or access control lists (ACLs) to limit SSH access to specific IP addresses or networks.
    * **Change Default SSH Port (Optional):** While not a primary security measure, changing the default SSH port can reduce automated scanning and brute-force attempts.
    * **Regularly Review SSH Configuration:** Periodically audit the SSH configuration file (`sshd_config`) to ensure it adheres to security best practices.
    * **Consider Bastion Hosts:** For enhanced security, use a bastion host (jump server) to control access to the Kamal server. Users first connect to the bastion host and then SSH to the Kamal server.
