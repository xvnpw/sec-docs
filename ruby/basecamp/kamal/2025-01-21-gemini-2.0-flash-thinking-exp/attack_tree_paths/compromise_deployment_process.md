### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Deployment Process

**Attack Tree Path:** Compromise Deployment Process

**Goal:** To gain unauthorized control over the deployed application or its environment by manipulating the deployment process.

**Attack Vectors:**

#### 4.1 Injecting Malicious Docker Images into the Deployment Pipeline

**Description:** An attacker aims to introduce a compromised Docker image into the deployment pipeline, which will then be deployed by Kamal. This malicious image could contain backdoors, malware, or altered application code designed to compromise the system or steal data.

**Detailed Analysis:**

* **Attack Scenario:**
    1. **Compromise Developer Machine/Credentials:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine or their credentials for the container registry.
    2. **Push Malicious Image:** The attacker pushes a Docker image with a legitimate-sounding tag or version number to the container registry, potentially overwriting a legitimate image or introducing a new, malicious one.
    3. **Kamal Pulls Malicious Image:** When Kamal initiates a deployment, it pulls the image from the registry. If the attacker successfully replaced or introduced a malicious image, Kamal will deploy it.
    4. **Execution of Malicious Code:** The compromised container starts on the target server, executing the malicious code within.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Breach:** The malicious container could exfiltrate sensitive data.
    * **System Compromise:** The container could provide a backdoor for further exploitation of the target server.
    * **Service Disruption:** The malicious code could intentionally crash the application or its dependencies.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  This attack vector represents a significant supply chain risk, as the compromise occurs before the application even reaches the production environment.

* **Likelihood:**
    * **Medium to High:**  The likelihood depends on the security practices surrounding the container registry and developer access. If access controls are weak or developers are not vigilant about security, this attack is plausible.

* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Vulnerable Container Registry:** Lack of strong authentication, authorization, or image scanning capabilities.
    * **Compromised Developer Credentials:** Weak passwords, phishing attacks, or malware on developer machines.
    * **Lack of Image Verification:**  The deployment process doesn't verify the integrity or source of the Docker image.

* **Detection:**
    * **Image Scanning:** Regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities and malware.
    * **Registry Auditing:** Monitoring registry activity for unauthorized pushes or pulls.
    * **Deviation from Expected Image:**  Monitoring deployed containers to ensure they match expected image digests or signatures.
    * **Behavioral Analysis:** Detecting unusual activity within running containers.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Container Registry:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication), authorization, and access control policies for the container registry.
    * **Image Signing and Verification:** Use Docker Content Trust (DCT) or similar mechanisms to sign and verify the integrity and provenance of container images.
    * **Regular Image Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline and the container registry.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to developers and CI/CD systems for the container registry.
    * **Secure Developer Workstations:** Implement security measures on developer machines, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and regular security awareness training.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat deployed containers as immutable and replace them instead of modifying them in place.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the container registry and deployment infrastructure from other networks.

#### 4.2 Tampering with Deployment Scripts or Hooks to Introduce Malicious Code or Configurations

**Description:** An attacker modifies the deployment scripts or hooks used by Kamal to introduce malicious code or configurations. This could involve altering the `deploy.yml` file, custom deployment scripts, or hooks executed during the deployment process.

**Detailed Analysis:**

* **Attack Scenario:**
    1. **Compromise Code Repository:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    2. **Modify Deployment Scripts/Hooks:** The attacker modifies files like `deploy.yml` or custom deployment scripts to include malicious commands or configurations. This could involve:
        * Downloading and executing malicious scripts.
        * Modifying environment variables to inject malicious values.
        * Altering application configurations to create backdoors.
    3. **Trigger Deployment:** The attacker or a compromised CI/CD system triggers a deployment using the modified scripts.
    4. **Execution of Malicious Code:** Kamal executes the tampered scripts or hooks on the target server, leading to the execution of malicious code or the application of malicious configurations.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Breach:** Malicious scripts could exfiltrate data during deployment.
    * **System Compromise:** Backdoors could be introduced into the deployed application or the underlying infrastructure.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious configurations could grant unauthorized access or privileges.
    * **Service Manipulation:** Deployment scripts could be altered to disrupt or manipulate the application's functionality.

* **Likelihood:**
    * **Medium:** The likelihood depends heavily on the security of the code repository and the access controls in place. If the repository is poorly secured or CI/CD pipelines are vulnerable, this attack is feasible.

* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Vulnerable Code Repository:** Weak access controls, lack of multi-factor authentication, or compromised developer credentials.
    * **Insecure CI/CD Pipeline:**  Lack of proper authorization, insecure secrets management, or vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools.
    * **Lack of Code Review:**  Deployment script changes are not reviewed before being deployed.
    * **Insufficient Input Validation:** Deployment scripts don't properly validate inputs or external data.

* **Detection:**
    * **Code Review and Auditing:** Regularly review deployment scripts and configurations for suspicious changes.
    * **Version Control Monitoring:** Monitor the code repository for unauthorized commits or modifications to deployment-related files.
    * **CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Implement security best practices for the CI/CD pipeline, including secure secrets management and access controls.
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning:** Scan IaC configurations (like `deploy.yml`) for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
    * **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor the deployment process and the deployed application for unexpected behavior or resource usage.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Code Repository:** Implement strong authentication (MFA), authorization, and access control policies for the code repository.
    * **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforce code reviews and prevent direct pushes to protected branches containing deployment scripts.
    * **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement secure secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), enforce least privilege, and regularly update CI/CD tools.
    * **Code Signing for Scripts:** Sign deployment scripts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
    * **Immutable Deployment Configurations:** Treat deployment configurations as immutable and track changes carefully.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the deployment process and related infrastructure.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to CI/CD systems and deployment processes.
