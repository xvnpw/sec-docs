## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong SSH Key Management for Kamal Deployments](./mitigation_strategies/strong_ssh_key_management_for_kamal_deployments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong SSH Key Management for Kamal Deployments
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate a dedicated SSH key pair** specifically for Kamal deployments. This key will be used by Kamal to access and manage servers. Use `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/kamal_deploy_key`.
    2.  **Securely store the private key** on the machine where Kamal commands are executed (e.g., developer's workstation, CI/CD server). Protect it with file permissions like `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/kamal_deploy_key`.
    3.  **Configure Kamal to use this dedicated key** by specifying the path to the private key in the `ssh_key` setting within your `deploy.yml` file. Example: `ssh_key: ~/.ssh/kamal_deploy_key`.
    4.  **Ensure the corresponding public key is deployed to the `authorized_keys`** of the designated Kamal deployment user on each server. Kamal's `kamal setup` command typically handles this automatically.
    5.  **Rotate the Kamal deployment SSH key periodically.** Generate a new key pair and update the `deploy.yml` and server configurations accordingly. This limits the lifespan of any potentially compromised key.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Kamal SSH key (Medium to High Severity):** If the SSH key used by Kamal is compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to servers and potentially control the application deployment process.
    *   **Unauthorized Kamal access (Medium Severity):** Weak or shared SSH keys increase the risk of unauthorized individuals using Kamal to manage deployments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Kamal SSH key:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized Kamal access:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Kamal relies on SSH keys, and `deploy.yml` allows specifying a key. However, dedicated key generation, automated rotation, and enforced usage of dedicated keys might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated SSH key rotation process for Kamal deployments, enforced use of dedicated keys (preventing reuse of personal or shared keys), and clear documentation for developers on best practices for managing Kamal SSH keys.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kamal Secret Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kamal_secret_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Kamal Secret Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Kamal's built-in `secrets` feature** to manage sensitive application configuration values. Define secrets within the `secrets` section of your `deploy.yml` file.
    2.  **Encrypt secrets at rest** using Kamal's encryption mechanism. Kamal uses a master key for encryption. Ensure this master key is itself securely managed and ideally rotated periodically (though Kamal's documentation on master key rotation should be consulted).
    3.  **Avoid storing secrets directly in plain text** within the `deploy.yml` file. Use the `kamal secrets push` command to securely upload and manage secrets on the servers.
    4.  **Restrict access to the `deploy.yml` file** and the environment where Kamal commands are executed. Only authorized personnel should be able to modify the deployment configuration and manage secrets.
    5.  **Understand Kamal's secret injection mechanism.** Kamal typically injects secrets as environment variables into the Docker containers. Ensure your application code retrieves secrets from environment variables and not from configuration files within the image.
    6.  **For highly sensitive environments, evaluate if Kamal's built-in secret management is sufficient.** Consider if integration with external secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault) is necessary for enhanced security, audit trails, and finer-grained access control, even though Kamal doesn't directly offer built-in integration for these.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of secrets in `deploy.yml` (High Severity):** Prevents storing secrets in plain text configuration files, reducing the risk of accidental exposure in version control or backups.
    *   **Unauthorized access to application secrets (Medium Severity):** Kamal's encryption and access control to `deploy.yml` help protect secrets from unauthorized access via configuration files.
    *   **Secret leakage during deployment (Low to Medium Severity):** Using `kamal secrets` and environment variable injection minimizes the risk of secrets being logged or exposed during the deployment process itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of secrets in `deploy.yml`:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized access to application secrets:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Secret leakage during deployment:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Kamal provides the `secrets` feature, but the extent of encryption usage, master key management practices, and strict adherence to using `kamal secrets` instead of plain text in `deploy.yml` might vary.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal policy enforcing the use of `kamal secrets` for all sensitive configuration, documented master key management and rotation procedures for Kamal secrets, automated checks to prevent plain text secrets in `deploy.yml`, and potentially an evaluation of external secret management integration needs for specific projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `deploy.yml` Configuration Review](./mitigation_strategies/secure__deploy_yml__configuration_review.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `deploy.yml` Configuration Review
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement mandatory code review processes for all changes to `deploy.yml`.** Security considerations should be a specific part of the review checklist.
    2.  **Utilize linters or static analysis tools** (if available and applicable to YAML or configuration languages) to automatically scan `deploy.yml` for potential syntax errors, misconfigurations, or security-related issues.
    3.  **Establish and document secure configuration guidelines for `deploy.yml`.** This should include best practices for defining services, volumes, secrets, and other Kamal configurations to minimize security risks.
    4.  **Version control `deploy.yml`** using Git or a similar system. Track all changes and enable rollback capabilities to previous configurations in case of errors or security issues introduced by configuration updates.
    5.  **Regularly audit `deploy.yml` configurations** to ensure they align with security best practices and project security policies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigurations in Kamal deployment leading to vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Configuration errors in `deploy.yml` could inadvertently expose services, weaken security settings, or create other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Accidental exposure of sensitive information in `deploy.yml` (Medium Severity):**  Incorrectly configured volumes or other settings could unintentionally expose sensitive data.
    *   **Deployment failures due to configuration errors (Low to Medium Severity, indirectly security related):** Configuration errors can lead to deployment failures, impacting application availability and potentially creating security incidents during recovery.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigurations in Kamal deployment leading to vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Accidental exposure of sensitive information in `deploy.yml`:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Deployment failures due to configuration errors:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are likely in place for code changes, but specific security-focused reviews of `deploy.yml` and automated static analysis for configuration might be missing. Version control is likely used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal security review checklist specifically for `deploy.yml` changes, integration of static analysis tools for `deploy.yml` into CI/CD, documented secure configuration guidelines for `deploy.yml`, and automated alerts for detected security issues in `deploy.yml` configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging for Kamal Operations](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging_for_kamal_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Audit Logging for Kamal Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable detailed logging of Kamal commands and actions.** Configure Kamal (if possible through configuration or wrapper scripts) to log all executed commands, deployment steps, rollbacks, secret management operations, and any errors encountered.
    2.  **Centralize Kamal logs** by forwarding them to a dedicated security information and event management (SIEM) system or a centralized logging platform. This allows for aggregation, analysis, and alerting on Kamal-related events.
    3.  **Configure monitoring and alerting rules** within the SIEM or logging platform to detect suspicious Kamal activities, such as unauthorized deployment attempts, configuration changes by unexpected users, or repeated errors during deployment.
    4.  **Regularly review Kamal logs** for security incidents, configuration drift, and operational issues related to deployments.
    5.  **Establish log retention policies** for Kamal logs to meet compliance requirements and facilitate incident investigation in the future.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lack of visibility into Kamal actions (Medium Severity):** Without logging, it's difficult to track who performed what actions using Kamal, hindering accountability and incident investigation.
    *   **Delayed detection of unauthorized Kamal usage (Medium Severity):** Audit logs and monitoring can help detect unauthorized individuals attempting to use Kamal for deployments or configuration changes.
    *   **Difficulty in diagnosing deployment issues (Medium Severity, indirectly security related):** Logs are crucial for troubleshooting deployment failures and identifying root causes, which can indirectly prevent security incidents caused by misconfigurations or failed deployments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lack of visibility into Kamal actions:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Delayed detection of unauthorized Kamal usage:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Difficulty in diagnosing deployment issues:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing or partially implemented. Kamal's default logging might be basic. Centralized logging, automated monitoring, and regular log reviews specifically for Kamal actions are probably not in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration of detailed Kamal operation logging (if configurable), integration of Kamal logs with a centralized SIEM or logging platform, automated monitoring and alerting rules for Kamal logs, defined log retention policies, and procedures for regular review of Kamal logs for security and operational insights.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Kamal Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_kamal_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Kamal Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly check for new releases of Kamal** on the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/basecamp/kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal)).
    2.  **Monitor Kamal's release notes and changelogs** for security patches, bug fixes, and new security features.
    3.  **Establish a process for updating Kamal** to the latest stable version in your deployment environment. This might involve updating the Kamal gem or binary used in your CI/CD pipeline or developer workstations.
    4.  **Test Kamal updates in a non-production environment** before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and avoid unexpected issues.
    5.  **Subscribe to Kamal security advisories or announcements** (if available) to be promptly notified of critical security vulnerabilities and updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of known Kamal vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of Kamal might contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to compromise the deployment process or servers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of known Kamal vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially ad-hoc or manual. Developers might update Kamal occasionally, but a formal process for regular updates, vulnerability monitoring, and testing of updates might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal process for regularly checking for Kamal updates, automated notifications for new Kamal releases and security advisories, documented procedure for updating Kamal in different environments, and integration of Kamal update testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
