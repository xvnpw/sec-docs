# Attack Surface Analysis for basecamp/kamal

## Attack Surface: [SSH Key Exposure](./attack_surfaces/ssh_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of the SSH keys used by Kamal to access and manage target servers.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal relies on SSH keys for authentication and command execution on remote servers. The security of these keys is paramount for the security of the entire infrastructure managed by Kamal.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the private SSH key stored on the developer's machine or in the CI/CD pipeline used by Kamal. They can then use this key to SSH into any server managed by Kamal and gain full control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the target servers, data breaches, service disruption, and the ability to deploy malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dedicated, passphrase-protected SSH keys specifically for Kamal.
        *   Avoid storing SSH keys directly in version control. Utilize secure secret management solutions.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the machine running Kamal and where SSH keys are stored.
        *   Regularly rotate SSH keys used by Kamal.
        *   Utilize SSH agent forwarding securely with appropriate safeguards.
        *   Consider using certificate-based authentication instead of key-based authentication if supported by the environment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Kamal Configuration (`deploy.yml`)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_kamal_configuration___deploy_yml__.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure or manipulation of the `config/deploy.yml` file containing sensitive information.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** This file stores critical configuration details, including server credentials, registry information, and potentially secrets or environment variables.
    *   **Example:** The `deploy.yml` file is committed to a public repository, exposing server credentials. An attacker can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, access to sensitive data, ability to deploy malicious applications, and potential financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never commit `deploy.yml` directly to version control.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure secret management solutions to store sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in `deploy.yml`.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the `deploy.yml` file on the local machine and in any deployment pipelines.
        *   Encrypt the `deploy.yml` file at rest if it contains sensitive information that cannot be moved to environment variables or a secrets manager.
        *   Regularly review and audit the contents of `deploy.yml` for any inadvertently exposed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Docker Image Supply Chain](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_docker_image_supply_chain.md)

*   **Description:** Deployment of compromised or vulnerable Docker images through Kamal.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal pulls Docker images from specified registries. If these registries are compromised or untrusted, malicious images can be deployed without explicit verification.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a public Docker registry and injects malware into a popular base image. Kamal, configured to pull this image, deploys the compromised container to production.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware into the application environment, data breaches, compromised application functionality, and potential supply chain attacks affecting users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only pull Docker images from trusted and reputable registries.
        *   Implement image scanning and vulnerability analysis as part of the CI/CD pipeline before deployment with Kamal.
        *   Utilize Docker Content Trust to verify the authenticity and integrity of images.
        *   Pin specific image tags or digests to avoid accidentally pulling updated but potentially compromised versions.
        *   Regularly update base images to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution via Kamal CLI Access](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution_via_kamal_cli_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to the machine running Kamal and using its CLI to execute malicious commands on target servers.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal's CLI provides powerful commands for managing and deploying applications, which can be abused if an attacker gains access to the tool.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's laptop and uses the `kamal app exec` command to execute arbitrary commands as root on a production server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of target servers, data manipulation, service disruption, and the ability to deploy malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the machine running Kamal.
        *   Restrict access to the Kamal CLI to authorized personnel only.
        *   Regularly audit the usage of Kamal commands.
        *   Consider implementing a "least privilege" approach for users interacting with Kamal.
        *   Secure the environment where Kamal is executed (e.g., hardened operating system, up-to-date security patches).

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Management Vulnerabilities within Kamal](./attack_surfaces/secrets_management_vulnerabilities_within_kamal.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Kamal handles and manages application secrets.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal provides mechanisms for managing secrets, but vulnerabilities in this process can lead to exposure.
    *   **Example:** Secrets are stored unencrypted in environment variables managed by Kamal or are accessible to unauthorized processes on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data, API keys, database credentials, and other confidential information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Kamal.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in environment variables or configuration files managed by Kamal.
        *   Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the secrets management system.
        *   Regularly rotate application secrets.
