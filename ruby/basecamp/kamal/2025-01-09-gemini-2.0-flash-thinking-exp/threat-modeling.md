# Threat Model Analysis for basecamp/kamal

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in `deploy.yml`](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in__deploy_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `deploy.yml` file (e.g., through a compromised repository, insecure storage, or social engineering). They read sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets that are directly embedded within the file. This directly involves how Kamal's configuration is managed.

**Impact:** Full compromise of backend services, data breaches, unauthorized access to third-party services, financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading module within Kamal, specifically the parsing of `deploy.yml`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Kamal's built-in secret management features (e.g., using environment variables injected at runtime).
* Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in `deploy.yml`.
* Store `deploy.yml` in private repositories with strict access controls.
* Encrypt sensitive sections of `deploy.yml` if direct embedding is unavoidable (though highly discouraged).

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Secret Transmission](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_secret_transmission.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the machine running Kamal and the remote server during the initial setup or when secrets are being transferred *by Kamal*. They can then capture sensitive information being transmitted, such as SSH keys or environment variables containing secrets. This directly involves Kamal's communication mechanisms.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the remote server, potential data breaches, ability to manipulate the deployment process.

**Affected Component:** Kamal's SSH module used for remote command execution and file transfer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure SSH connections established by Kamal are secure and verified.
* Utilize SSH key-based authentication instead of password-based authentication for Kamal's connections.
* Consider using VPNs or other secure channels for communication between the Kamal host and the remote servers.
* Implement monitoring for unusual network activity related to Kamal's connections.

## Threat: [Compromised SSH Keys Used by Kamal](./threats/compromised_ssh_keys_used_by_kamal.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the private SSH key used *by Kamal* to authenticate with the remote servers (e.g., through a compromised development machine, insecure key storage where Kamal's keys are kept, or social engineering). They can then use this key to connect to and control the servers without authorization, bypassing normal access controls.

**Impact:** Full control over the remote servers, potential data breaches, service disruption, ability to deploy malicious code.

**Affected Component:** Kamal's SSH module, specifically the key management and authentication functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store the private SSH key used by Kamal, restricting access to authorized users and systems only.
* Use strong passphrases to protect the private key used by Kamal.
* Regularly rotate the SSH keys used by Kamal.
* Implement auditing of SSH key usage by Kamal.
* Consider using SSH agent forwarding with caution and proper security measures for Kamal's operations.

## Threat: [Malicious Modification of `deploy.yml`](./threats/malicious_modification_of__deploy_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the repository containing `deploy.yml` or the system where Kamal is run modifies the configuration file to execute malicious commands on the remote servers *during deployment or management tasks initiated by Kamal*. This could involve deploying backdoors, altering application behavior, or causing denial of service.

**Impact:** Compromise of the deployed application and infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption, introduction of vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, command execution module within Kamal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the repository and the system running Kamal.
* Utilize version control for `deploy.yml` and review changes carefully.
* Implement code review processes for changes to `deploy.yml`.
* Consider using infrastructure-as-code tools with built-in security features and policy enforcement.

## Threat: [Pulling Compromised Docker Images](./threats/pulling_compromised_docker_images.md)

**Description:** Kamal pulls Docker images from a specified registry. If an attacker compromises the registry or manages to push a malicious image with the same name and tag, Kamal could deploy a vulnerable or malicious application. This directly involves Kamal's image fetching process.

**Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable or malicious applications, potential data breaches, compromise of the underlying infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Docker image pulling functionality within Kamal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only pull images from trusted and verified registries.
* Utilize image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Docker images before deployment.
* Implement a process for verifying the integrity and authenticity of Docker images (e.g., using image signing).
* Consider using a private container registry with strict access controls.

## Threat: [Tampering with Built Docker Images](./threats/tampering_with_built_docker_images.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the environment where *Kamal* builds Docker images. They could inject malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities into the application image during the build process orchestrated by Kamal.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, potential data breaches, compromise of the underlying infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Docker image building functionality within Kamal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Docker build environment used by Kamal with appropriate access controls and security measures.
* Implement integrity checks for files and dependencies used during the build process initiated by Kamal.
* Utilize multi-stage Docker builds to minimize the attack surface of the final image.
* Scan built images for vulnerabilities before deployment using Kamal.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Kamal Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_kamal_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability within the Kamal application code. This could allow them to bypass authentication *within Kamal*, execute arbitrary code on the Kamal host, or compromise the deployment process *managed by Kamal*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to deployment infrastructure, ability to manipulate deployments, potential compromise of remote servers.

**Affected Component:** Any module or function within the Kamal codebase that contains a vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability. We are including it as potentially critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Kamal updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor Kamal's release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
* Follow security best practices for the environment where Kamal is running.
* Consider security audits or penetration testing of Kamal deployments.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Load Balancers Managed by Kamal](./threats/misconfiguration_of_load_balancers_managed_by_kamal.md)

**Description:** If Kamal is used to manage load balancers, a misconfiguration (either accidental or malicious through Kamal's configuration) could expose internal services to the public internet, bypass security controls, or cause service disruptions. This directly relates to Kamal's load balancer management features.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive internal services, potential data breaches, service unavailability.

**Affected Component:** Load balancer management module within Kamal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and validate load balancer configurations managed by Kamal.
* Follow security best practices for load balancer configuration.
* Implement infrastructure-as-code principles for managing load balancer configurations through Kamal, allowing for version control and review.
* Regularly audit load balancer configurations managed by Kamal.
