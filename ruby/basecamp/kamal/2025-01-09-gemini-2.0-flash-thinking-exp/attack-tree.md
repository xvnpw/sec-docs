## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Kamal Configuration/Secrets (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_kamal_configurationsecrets__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the `deploy.yml` file or other configuration files used by Kamal to find sensitive information.
    * **Expose Sensitive Environment Variables (Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Credentials, API keys, and other secrets are directly embedded as plain text within the `env` section of the `deploy.yml` file.
        * **Attack Vector:** Secrets are stored in environment variables without proper encryption or secure storage mechanisms on the deployment server.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to steal the credentials used by Kamal to interact with the deployment servers.
    * **Steal Kamal Deployment Credentials (Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Attackers compromise a developer's machine where Kamal is configured, extracting SSH keys or the `deploy.yml` file containing server access details.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target CI/CD systems that might store Kamal configuration or credentials, gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Kamal's Server Access (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_kamal's_server_access__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the deployment servers managed by Kamal.
    * **Compromise SSH Access to Deployment Servers (Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target developer machines to steal SSH keys that are authorized to access the deployment servers.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in SSH daemons running on the deployment servers.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers brute-force weak SSH passwords if password authentication is enabled.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to compromise user accounts with SSH access.
    * **Abuse `kamal app shell` or `kamal app exec`:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise a developer's machine or credentials that have permissions to execute shell commands or specific commands within the running containers using Kamal's CLI tools. This allows them to directly interact with the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Kamal's Docker Image Management (High-Risk Path if successful):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_kamal's_docker_image_management__high-risk_path_if_successful_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code into the Docker images deployed by Kamal.
    * **Inject Malicious Code into Docker Image:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the software supply chain by introducing malicious dependencies into the application code during the build process.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the Docker image registry used by Kamal to store and retrieve images.
    * **Manipulate Image Registry (Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the credentials used to access the Docker image registry, allowing them to push malicious images disguised as legitimate ones.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the image registry software itself to push or modify images without proper authorization.
