# BUSINESS POSTURE

Kamal, as a deployment tool, aims to simplify and streamline the process of deploying web applications to servers. This addresses several key business priorities:

- Faster time to market: By simplifying deployment, Kamal enables faster release cycles for new features and applications, allowing businesses to respond quickly to market demands and gain a competitive edge.
- Reduced operational costs: Automating and simplifying deployment reduces the manual effort and specialized expertise required, leading to lower operational costs associated with deployment and maintenance.
- Increased reliability and consistency:  Standardized deployment processes enforced by Kamal reduce human error and configuration drift, leading to more reliable and consistent application deployments and reduced downtime.
- Developer productivity: By abstracting away the complexities of server management and deployment, Kamal allows developers to focus on building and improving applications, increasing overall productivity.

Key business risks associated with these priorities include:

- Downtime due to deployment failures:  If Kamal malfunctions or is misconfigured, it could lead to deployment failures and application downtime, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction.
- Security breaches during deployment:  Vulnerabilities in Kamal or insecure deployment practices could expose sensitive data or systems during the deployment process.
- Vendor lock-in (if Kamal becomes a critical dependency):  Over-reliance on Kamal could create vendor lock-in and potential challenges if the project is discontinued or significantly changed in the future.
- Operational complexity if not properly managed: While aiming to simplify deployment, improper use or integration of Kamal could introduce new complexities if not well-managed and understood by operations teams.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Access control to the Kamal repository on GitHub, managed by GitHub permissions. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
- security control: Code review process for contributions to Kamal. Implemented in: Project contribution guidelines and pull request process.
- security control: Reliance on underlying infrastructure security (servers, networks) where applications are deployed. Implemented in: User's responsibility to secure their infrastructure.
- security control: Use of SSH for secure communication with servers. Implemented in: Kamal's core functionality.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Kamal. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of Kamal by users leading to insecure deployments. Mitigation: Documentation and best practices guidelines.
- accepted risk:  Compromise of user's SSH keys used for deployment. Mitigation: User's responsibility to secure their keys.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST) in the Kamal CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in the Kamal codebase.
- security control:  Introduce dependency vulnerability scanning and automated updates for Kamal's dependencies.
- security control: Provide guidance and tooling for secure secrets management within Kamal deployments.
- security control: Implement audit logging for Kamal operations to track deployment activities and potential security incidents.
- security control:  Offer options for integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for centralized security monitoring.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Kamal itself does not require user authentication as it's a CLI tool executed in the user's environment. However, access to the Kamal repository and related infrastructure (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) should be authenticated.
    - Requirement:  Deployment to target servers relies on SSH key-based authentication. Kamal should securely manage and utilize SSH keys.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is primarily managed at the infrastructure level (server access control, network segmentation). Kamal should respect and integrate with existing authorization mechanisms.
    - Requirement:  Within Kamal, authorization might be relevant for managing deployment configurations and access to sensitive operations. This should be considered for future enhancements.
- Input validation:
    - Requirement: Kamal should validate user inputs, such as configuration files and command-line arguments, to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement:  Kamal should handle errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Kamal uses SSH, which relies on cryptography for secure communication. Ensure proper configuration and secure key management practices.
    - Requirement:  For secrets management, Kamal should support or integrate with secure secret storage mechanisms and avoid storing secrets in plain text in configuration files or logs. Consider encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit within Kamal's operations if applicable.
