# Threat Model Analysis for basecamp/kamal

## Threat: [Compromised Control Machine](./threats/compromised_control_machine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the machine running the Kamal CLI. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities or through social engineering. Once compromised, the attacker can use the Kamal CLI to deploy malicious code, modify deployments, access secrets, or disrupt services.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of deployed applications and infrastructure. Data breaches, service disruption, reputational damage, and significant financial loss are possible.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal CLI, Control Machine Infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the control machine operating system and applications (regular patching, minimal software installation).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization (MFA, strong passwords, SSH key-based access).
        *   Restrict network access to the control machine.
        *   Implement robust logging and monitoring of control machine activity.
        *   Use a dedicated, hardened machine for Kamal control plane operations.

## Threat: [Leaked or Stolen Kamal Configuration Files (`deploy.yml`, `.env`)](./threats/leaked_or_stolen_kamal_configuration_files___deploy_yml_____env__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains access to `deploy.yml` or `.env` files, which may contain sensitive information like server credentials, database passwords, API keys, and deployment settings. This could happen through insecure storage or accidental exposure. With access to these files, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to servers, applications, and databases, or manipulate deployments.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to servers and applications. Exposure of secrets leading to data breaches. Ability to manipulate deployments and cause service disruption.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal Configuration Files (`deploy.yml`, `.env`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store configuration files in private repositories with strict access controls.
        *   Avoid committing secrets directly to configuration files.
        *   Utilize Kamal's secrets management features or external secret stores for sensitive data.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files if necessary.
        *   Regularly audit access to configuration repositories and files.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Kamal CLI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_kamal_cli.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kamal CLI, allowing them to execute Kamal commands. This could be due to weak access controls on the control machine. With CLI access, the attacker can deploy, restart, or destroy applications and infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Service disruption through unauthorized deployments or destruction of applications. Potential data breaches if deployments are manipulated maliciously.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal CLI, Control Machine Access Control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Kamal CLI to authorized personnel only.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the control machine and Kamal CLI.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) if managing Kamal access for multiple teams.
        *   Regularly review and audit user access to the control machine and Kamal CLI.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Kamal CLI or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kamal_cli_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Kamal CLI or its dependencies (Ruby gems, Docker client, SSH client) may contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities on the control machine to gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service, impacting Kamal's operations.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Control machine compromise. Potential for lateral movement to target servers. Deployment manipulation and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal CLI Application, Kamal Dependencies (Ruby Gems, Docker Client, SSH Client).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Kamal CLI and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor for security advisories related to Kamal and its dependencies.
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning on the control machine.
        *   Use a security-focused operating system for the control machine.

## Threat: [Secrets Stored Insecurely in Kamal Configuration or Environment](./threats/secrets_stored_insecurely_in_kamal_configuration_or_environment.md)

*   **Description:** If secrets (database passwords, API keys, etc.) are stored directly in plain text within `deploy.yml`, `.env` files, or environment variables used by Kamal, they are highly vulnerable to exposure if these files or the environment are compromised.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Exposure of sensitive credentials. Unauthorized access to databases, APIs, and other resources. Data breaches and significant financial loss.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal Configuration Files (`deploy.yml`, `.env`), Environment Variables used by Kamal.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** store secrets directly in plain text in configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Utilize Kamal's built-in encrypted secrets feature in `deploy.yml`.
        *   Integrate with external secret management solutions (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
        *   Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit when managed by Kamal or external solutions.

## Threat: [Compromised Kamal Releases or Malicious Updates](./threats/compromised_kamal_releases_or_malicious_updates.md)

*   **Description:** If the official Kamal releases or update channels are compromised, malicious code could be injected into Kamal itself. Users downloading and using compromised versions of Kamal would then be vulnerable, potentially allowing attackers to control deployments.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Widespread compromise of applications and infrastructure managed by Kamal. Potential for data breaches, service disruption, and large-scale attacks.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal Release Process, Kamal Update Mechanism, Kamal Distribution Channels.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download Kamal from official and trusted sources (GitHub releases, official website).
        *   Verify the integrity of Kamal releases using checksums or signatures provided by the maintainers.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to Kamal from trusted sources.
        *   Implement a process for quickly updating Kamal in case of security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Kamal Dependencies (Ruby Gems, Docker Images)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kamal_dependencies__ruby_gems__docker_images_.md)

*   **Description:** Kamal relies on various dependencies, including Ruby gems and Docker images. If these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, they can indirectly affect the security of Kamal itself and deployments managed by it. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to control machine compromise or deployment manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Control machine compromise. Potential for deployment manipulation.
    *   **Affected Kamal Component:** Kamal Dependencies (Ruby Gems, Docker Images).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Kamal and its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit for Ruby gems, vulnerability scanners for Docker images) to identify vulnerabilities in Kamal's dependencies.
        *   Pin dependency versions in `Gemfile.lock` and Docker image manifests to ensure consistent and predictable deployments and facilitate vulnerability management.
        *   Monitor dependency vulnerability databases and security advisories.
