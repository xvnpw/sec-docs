## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kamal Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kamal_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations within the `deploy.yml` file and related Traefik configuration, which are central to Kamal's deployment process.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers target common misconfigurations arising from user error or lack of security awareness during setup.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Wide range of impacts from information disclosure to full application compromise, depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand Kamal and Traefik configuration best practices.
    *   Implement automated configuration linting and validation tools.
    *   Regularly audit configurations for security weaknesses.
    *   Provide security training to deployment teams.

    *   **1.1. Misconfigured deploy.yml [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The `deploy.yml` file itself is the primary configuration for Kamal. Any misconfiguration here can have cascading security implications.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers analyze `deploy.yml` (if accessible or leaked) or probe the deployed application to identify weaknesses stemming from configuration errors.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Serves as the root cause for various configuration-related vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Treat `deploy.yml` as a critical security component. Secure its storage, access, and review process.

        *   **1.1.1. Exposed Secrets in deploy.yml [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Accidental or intentional inclusion of sensitive secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) directly within the `deploy.yml` file.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers find plaintext secrets in publicly accessible repositories, leaked files, or compromised systems.
            *   **Potential Impact:**  Full compromise of the application and potentially related systems if secrets grant access to critical resources.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Never store secrets in plaintext in `deploy.yml`.**
                *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
                *   Implement secret scanning tools to prevent accidental commits.

                *   **1.1.1.1. Plaintext Secrets [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:**  Storing secrets directly as plaintext strings in `deploy.yml`.
                    *   **Exploitation:**  Trivial to exploit if `deploy.yml` is accessible to attackers.
                    *   **Potential Impact:**  Immediate and severe compromise.
                    *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly avoid plaintext secrets. Use environment variables or dedicated secret management.

        *   **1.1.2. Incorrect Network Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Misconfiguration of network settings, often within Traefik routing rules, leading to unintended exposure of internal services.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers scan for open ports and accessible services that should be internal-only.
            *   **Potential Impact:**  Direct access to databases, internal APIs, or other sensitive components, leading to data breaches or further compromise.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Carefully define Traefik routing rules, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
                *   Use network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to internal services.
                *   Regularly audit network configurations.

                *   **1.1.2.1. Allowing public access to internal services (e.g., database port exposed via Traefik misconfig) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, misconfiguring Traefik to route external traffic directly to internal services like databases, bypassing intended access controls.
                    *   **Exploitation:**  Attackers directly connect to exposed internal services.
                    *   **Potential Impact:**  Direct data breach, database compromise, and potential lateral movement.
                    *   **Mitigation:**  Double-check Traefik routing rules to ensure internal services are not publicly accessible. Use network policies to enforce isolation.

        *   **1.1.3. Insecure Traefik Configuration (managed by Kamal) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Weaknesses in the configuration of Traefik, the reverse proxy and load balancer integrated with Kamal.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in Traefik to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or even achieve remote code execution via Traefik vulnerabilities (less likely due to Kamal managing Traefik version, but misconfiguration is still a risk).
            *   **Potential Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, potential for RCE via Traefik API (if exposed and vulnerable), disruption of service.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Follow Traefik security best practices.
                *   Enable strong authentication for the Traefik dashboard if exposed.
                *   Use strong TLS configurations.
                *   Carefully review and test routing rules.

                *   **1.1.3.1. Open Traefik Dashboard without strong authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:**  Exposing the Traefik dashboard publicly without strong authentication (or with default/weak credentials).
                    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers access the dashboard, gaining full control over Traefik routing and configuration, potentially leading to RCE via the Traefik API.
                    *   **Potential Impact:**  Full control over application routing, potential for RCE, service disruption.
                    *   **Mitigation:**  Always secure the Traefik dashboard with strong authentication. Restrict access to authorized personnel only. Consider disabling the dashboard in production environments if not strictly necessary.

                *   **1.1.3.2. Misconfigured routing rules leading to unintended access [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:**  Errors in defining Traefik routing rules that inadvertently grant access to resources that should be protected or restricted.
                    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit flawed routing logic to access unintended parts of the application or backend services.
                    *   **Potential Impact:**  Unintended access to sensitive data or functionality, potential data exposure, or privilege escalation.
                    *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly test and review Traefik routing rules. Use a principle of least privilege when defining access paths.
