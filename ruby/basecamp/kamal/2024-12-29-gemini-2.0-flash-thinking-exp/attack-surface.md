*   **Attack Surface: Compromised SSH Keys**
    *   **Description:**  The SSH keys used by Kamal to access target servers are compromised, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal relies on SSH for remote command execution and file transfers during deployment and management. The `deploy.yml` file specifies the SSH user and potentially the key location.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `deploy.yml` file or the machine where the SSH key is stored. They can then use this key to SSH into the target servers as the user configured in Kamal.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the target servers, including the ability to deploy malicious code, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage SSH private keys. Avoid storing them directly in the `deploy.yml`.
        *   Use SSH key pairs with strong passphrases.
        *   Implement SSH key rotation policies.
        *   Restrict SSH access to the target servers to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
        *   Utilize SSH agent forwarding securely or consider alternative secure key management solutions.
        *   Regularly audit SSH access logs.

*   **Attack Surface: Stolen or Exposed Kamal Configuration (`deploy.yml`)**
    *   **Description:** The `deploy.yml` file, containing sensitive information, is exposed or stolen.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** `deploy.yml` stores critical configuration details, including server credentials (SSH user), Docker registry information, and potentially environment variables.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the `deploy.yml` file to a public repository, or an attacker gains access to the development machine or CI/CD pipeline where this file resides.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of server credentials, allowing unauthorized access. Exposure of Docker registry credentials, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious images. Insight into the infrastructure setup, aiding further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive information like passwords and API keys outside of `deploy.yml`, using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement strict access control for the `deploy.yml` file.
        *   Avoid committing `deploy.yml` to version control directly. Use templating or environment variable substitution.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within `deploy.yml` if it cannot be avoided.
        *   Regularly audit access to the `deploy.yml` file.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Docker Registry Credentials**
    *   **Description:** The credentials used by Kamal to access the Docker registry are weak or compromised.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal pulls Docker images from a specified registry. If the credentials for this registry are compromised, attackers can push malicious images.
    *   **Example:** Weak passwords for the Docker registry account are easily guessed, or the credentials are leaked through a compromised development environment. An attacker pushes a backdoored image with the same tag as a legitimate application image.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious container images, leading to compromised application functionality, data breaches, or complete server takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for Docker registry accounts.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Docker registry access.
        *   Store Docker registry credentials securely, preferably using dedicated secrets management tools.
        *   Regularly rotate Docker registry credentials.
        *   Implement image scanning and vulnerability analysis for images pulled from the registry.
        *   Consider using a private Docker registry with stricter access controls.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom Deployment Scripts**
    *   **Description:** Custom scripts defined in the `deploy.yml` for tasks like database migrations or application setup contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal executes these scripts on the target servers. If these scripts are not properly secured, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A deployment script contains a command injection vulnerability. An attacker, through some other means (e.g., a compromised environment variable), can inject malicious commands that will be executed with the privileges of the user running the script.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially full control over the target server, depending on the privileges of the user executing the script and the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and sanitize all custom deployment scripts.
        *   Avoid constructing commands dynamically using user-provided input.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining the user running the deployment scripts.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding in scripts.
        *   Regularly audit and update deployment scripts.

*   **Attack Surface: Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables**
    *   **Description:** Environment variables managed by Kamal contain sensitive information and are exposed.
    *   **How Kamal Contributes:** Kamal allows defining and managing environment variables that are passed to the deployed containers. If these variables contain secrets and are not handled securely, they can be exposed.
    *   **Example:** Sensitive API keys or database credentials are stored as plain text environment variables in the `deploy.yml` or are accessible through container introspection if not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing unauthorized access to external services or the application's database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables within `deploy.yml`.
        *   Utilize Kamal's `secrets.yml` feature for managing sensitive data.
        *   Ensure proper encryption and access control for `secrets.yml`.
        *   Consider using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and integrate them with Kamal.
        *   Avoid logging or exposing environment variables in application logs or error messages.
