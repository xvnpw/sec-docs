# Deep Analysis: Docker Registry Poisoning (Malicious Image Push) in Kamal Deployments

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "1.2.1.2. Push a malicious image with the same name as the legitimate image" within the context of a Kamal-based deployment.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors that enable this attack.
*   Identify the preconditions necessary for the attack to succeed.
*   Assess the potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent or detect this attack.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker successfully pushes a malicious Docker image to the registry used by Kamal, with the malicious image masquerading as the legitimate application image.  We will consider:

*   **Kamal's configuration and deployment process:** How Kamal interacts with the Docker registry, including authentication, image pulling, and tag handling.
*   **Docker Registry Security:**  The security posture of the Docker registry itself (e.g., Docker Hub, private registry, cloud provider registry).
*   **Image Building and Pushing Processes:**  The security of the CI/CD pipeline responsible for building and pushing images to the registry.
*   **Runtime Environment:** The security of the host environment where the Docker containers are running.

We will *not* cover other attack vectors against Kamal, such as compromising the Kamal configuration files directly (unless relevant to this specific attack path).  We also won't delve into general Docker security best practices unrelated to this specific attack.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it to identify specific attack steps and preconditions.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will analyze Kamal's documentation, source code (if necessary), and common Docker registry configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will propose and evaluate mitigation strategies, considering their effectiveness, feasibility, and potential impact on the development and deployment workflow.
5.  **Best Practices Review:** We will review industry best practices for Docker and container security to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.1.2

### 2.1 Attack Scenario Breakdown

The attack scenario unfolds as follows:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies the target application and the Docker registry it uses.  This could involve scanning public registries, analyzing publicly available configuration files (if any), or social engineering.
2.  **Credential Compromise (or Registry Misconfiguration):** The attacker gains write access to the Docker registry. This is the *critical enabling factor*.  This could happen through:
    *   **Stolen Credentials:**  Obtaining registry credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or data breaches.
    *   **Weak Credentials:**  Exploiting weak or default registry credentials.
    *   **Misconfigured Registry:**  Exploiting a registry that allows anonymous or unauthorized pushes (e.g., a misconfigured private registry).
    *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**  Gaining access to the CI/CD system that builds and pushes images, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code or push a malicious image directly.
3.  **Malicious Image Creation:** The attacker crafts a malicious Docker image. This image will likely:
    *   Have the *same name* as the legitimate application image.
    *   Potentially use the *same tag* as a legitimate image (if immutable tags are not enforced).  If immutable tags *are* enforced, the attacker might use a new tag and attempt to trick operators into using it, or wait for a new legitimate tag to be created and then quickly push a malicious image with that tag.
    *   Contain malicious code that will execute when the container is run. This could be a backdoor, a cryptominer, a data exfiltration tool, etc.
4.  **Image Push:** The attacker pushes the malicious image to the registry, overwriting the legitimate image (if tags are not immutable) or adding a new, malicious image with the same name.
5.  **Kamal Deployment (or Redeployment):**  When Kamal deploys or redeploys the application, it pulls the image from the registry.  If the malicious image has overwritten the legitimate one (or if the attacker has successfully tricked operators into using a malicious tag), Kamal will pull and run the malicious container.
6.  **Exploitation:** The malicious code within the container executes, achieving the attacker's objectives.

### 2.2 Preconditions

The following preconditions are necessary for this attack to succeed:

*   **Vulnerable Registry Access:** The attacker must have write access to the Docker registry.
*   **Lack of Immutable Tags (or Tag Manipulation):** If immutable tags are not enforced, the attacker can overwrite existing images. If they *are* enforced, the attacker must find a way to manipulate the tag used by Kamal.
*   **Lack of Image Verification:** Kamal (or the underlying Docker runtime) must not perform robust image verification (e.g., signature verification) before pulling and running the image.
*   **Lack of Runtime Monitoring:**  There must be insufficient monitoring of the running containers to detect the malicious activity.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful attack is **Very High**:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored or processed by the application.
*   **Integrity Violation:** The attacker could modify application data, code, or configuration.
*   **Availability Disruption:** The attacker could disrupt the application's availability by crashing it, deleting data, or launching a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could severely damage the reputation of the organization.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised container could be used as a launching pad for attacks against other systems within the network.
*   **Resource Abuse:** The attacker could use the compromised container for cryptomining or other resource-intensive activities.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent or detect this attack:

1.  **Strong Registry Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all registry accounts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all registry access, especially for accounts with write permissions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to each user or service account.  Avoid granting blanket write access.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:**  Rotate registry credentials regularly.
    *   **Audit Registry Access:**  Monitor registry access logs for suspicious activity.

2.  **Immutable Image Tags:**
    *   **Enforce Immutable Tags:**  Configure the Docker registry to prevent overwriting of existing image tags.  This is a *critical* control.  Most managed registry services (e.g., AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry) offer this feature.
    *   **Use Image Digests:**  Instead of relying solely on tags, use image digests (SHA256 hashes) to reference specific image versions.  Kamal supports this via the `digest` option in the `image` configuration.  This is the *most robust* way to ensure you're running the exact image you intend.

3.  **Image Signing and Verification:**
    *   **Use Docker Content Trust (Notary):**  Implement Docker Content Trust to sign images before pushing them to the registry and verify signatures before pulling them.  This ensures that the image has not been tampered with.  Kamal does not natively support Notary, but it can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and the Docker runtime.
    *   **Use a Third-Party Image Scanning and Verification Tool:**  Integrate a tool like Anchore, Clair, or Trivy into the CI/CD pipeline and/or the runtime environment to scan images for vulnerabilities and verify their integrity.

4.  **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **Protect CI/CD Credentials:**  Securely store and manage the credentials used by the CI/CD system to access the Docker registry.
    *   **Automated Image Scanning:**  Integrate image scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before images are pushed to the registry.
    *   **Code Review:**  Implement code review processes to ensure that malicious code is not introduced into the application or the Dockerfile.

5.  **Runtime Monitoring and Security:**
    *   **Container Security Monitoring Tools:**  Use container security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysdig, Falco, Aqua Security) to detect suspicious activity within running containers.
    *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic to and from the containers.
    *   **Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor:**  Use SELinux or AppArmor to enforce mandatory access control policies on containers, limiting their capabilities and preventing them from accessing unauthorized resources.

6.  **Kamal Configuration Best Practices:**
    *   **Use `digest` instead of `tag`:** As mentioned above, referencing images by their digest is the most secure approach.
    *   **Regularly Update Kamal:** Keep Kamal up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
    *   **Review Kamal's Security Documentation:**  Stay informed about Kamal's security recommendations and best practices.
