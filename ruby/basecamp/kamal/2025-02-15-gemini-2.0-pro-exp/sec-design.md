Okay, let's create a design document for Kamal (https://github.com/basecamp/kamal), focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Kamal is a deployment tool, and its primary business purpose is to simplify and streamline the deployment of web applications, particularly those built with Ruby on Rails, to various hosting environments.  It aims to bridge the gap between complex container orchestration tools and simpler, less flexible deployment methods.  It prioritizes ease of use and developer productivity.  Given Basecamp's (the creator of Kamal) pragmatic approach, we can assume a moderate risk appetite, balancing security with operational efficiency.

Business Priorities:

*   Reduce deployment complexity and time.
*   Enable developers to deploy applications without deep infrastructure expertise.
*   Support a variety of hosting environments (bare metal, cloud VMs).
*   Maintain application uptime and availability during deployments.
*   Provide a consistent and repeatable deployment process.
*   Minimize the "works on my machine" problem.

Business Goals:

*   Increase developer velocity.
*   Reduce operational overhead.
*   Improve application reliability.
*   Facilitate faster iteration cycles.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized access to servers or deployed applications, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   Deployment failures causing application downtime or data loss.
*   Vulnerabilities in the deployed application or its dependencies, exploited by attackers.
*   Misconfiguration of servers or deployment settings, leading to security weaknesses or operational issues.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting Kamal itself or its dependencies.
*   Lack of auditability and traceability of deployments, hindering incident response.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (as inferred from the repository and documentation):

*   security control: SSH for secure communication with servers. (Implemented in Kamal's core deployment logic)
*   security control: Docker containers for application isolation and dependency management. (Fundamental to Kamal's design)
*   security control: Environment variables for managing sensitive configuration data (e.g., secrets). (Recommended practice, enforced through Kamal's configuration)
*   security control: Health checks to ensure application availability after deployment. (Built-in feature of Kamal)
*   security control: Rolling deployments to minimize downtime. (Core feature of Kamal)
*   security control: Support for pre- and post-deployment hooks, allowing for custom security checks or actions. (Kamal's hook system)
*   security control: Signed commits. (Best practice, but enforcement depends on developer discipline and repository settings)
*   security control: Use of a dedicated Docker registry (implied, as Kamal uses Docker). (User's responsibility to secure their registry)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Relies on the security of the underlying Docker infrastructure and images.
*   accepted risk: Assumes the user has properly secured their SSH keys and server access.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in protection against application-level vulnerabilities (Kamal is a deployment tool, not a WAF or security scanner).
*   accepted risk: The security of the deployment process depends heavily on the user-provided configuration (e.g., secrets, server settings).
*   accepted risk: Single point of failure in the machine running Kamal.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement a robust secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, CyberArk Conjur) to securely store and inject secrets into the deployment process, rather than relying solely on environment variables.
*   security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools into the build pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in the application code and its dependencies.
*   security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) to scan the running application for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH access to servers.
*   security control: Implement a centralized logging and monitoring solution to track deployments, detect anomalies, and facilitate incident response.
*   security control: Regularly audit server configurations and security settings.
*   security control: Implement network segmentation to isolate the deployed application from other systems.
*   security control: Use a dedicated, hardened machine or container for running Kamal, separate from developer workstations.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   SSH key-based authentication is required for accessing servers.
    *   Strong password policies or MFA should be enforced for any user accounts involved in the deployment process.
    *   Access to the Docker registry should be authenticated and authorized.

*   Authorization:
    *   Principle of least privilege should be applied to all access controls (SSH, Docker registry, server access).
    *   Users should only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) should be considered for managing user permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Kamal should validate user-provided configuration data to prevent injection attacks or misconfigurations.
    *   Input validation should be performed at both the client-side (Kamal CLI) and server-side (where applicable).

*   Cryptography:
    *   SSH is used for secure communication.
    *   TLS should be used for all communication with the Docker registry.
    *   Sensitive data (e.g., secrets) should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    *   Cryptographic best practices should be followed (e.g., using strong algorithms and key lengths).

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Developer's Local Machine: Kamal can be run directly from a developer's workstation.
2.  Dedicated Build Server: Kamal can be run from a dedicated build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
3.  Cloud-Based Build Service: Kamal can be integrated with cloud-based build services (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI).

Chosen Solution (for detailed description): Developer's Local Machine

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Developer's Machine"
        A[Developer] --> B(Git Commit);
        B --> C(Build Script);
        C --> D(Docker Build);

    end
    subgraph "Docker Registry"
        E --> F(Image Storage);
    end
    classDef default fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px;
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to a Git repository.
2.  Developer runs a build script (likely locally, but could be on a CI server).
3.  The build script uses `docker build` to create a Docker image. This step should ideally include:
    *   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Scanning the application code for vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Linting: Checking code for style and potential errors.
4.  The build script uses `docker push` to push the image to a Docker registry.
    *   security control: Image signing: Digitally signing the image to ensure its integrity.
5.  The Docker registry stores the image.
    *   security control: Vulnerability scanning: Scanning the image for vulnerabilities within the registry.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:
