# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for basecamp/kamal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Image Provenance and Integrity (Kamal Hooks & Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_image_provenance_and_integrity__kamal_hooks_&_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement Image Signing Verification (Kamal Hook):**
    *   Create a `pre-deploy` hook in your Kamal configuration (e.g., in `config/deploy.yml` or a separate script referenced by it).
    *   This hook should use `docker trust inspect <your-image>:<tag>` (or a similar command for your chosen signing mechanism) to verify the image signature *before* Kamal pulls it.
    *   The hook should exit with a non-zero code if the signature is invalid, preventing the deployment.  Example (conceptual, needs adaptation):
        ```yaml
        hooks:
          pre-deploy:
            - command: ./scripts/verify_image_signature.sh
        ```
        `verify_image_signature.sh`:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        IMAGE="$KAMAL_REGISTRY/$KAMAL_IMAGE_NAME:$KAMAL_VERSION"
        docker trust inspect "$IMAGE" >/dev/null 2>&1
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "ERROR: Image signature verification failed for $IMAGE"
          exit 1
        fi
        ```
2.  **Configure Registry Authentication (Kamal Configuration):**
    *   In `config/deploy.yml`, configure Kamal to authenticate with your private registry using secure credentials.  *Do not* hardcode credentials. Use environment variables that are populated from a secret manager.
        ```yaml
        registry:
          server: your-registry.example.com
          username: <%= ENV['REGISTRY_USERNAME'] %>
          password: <%= ENV['REGISTRY_PASSWORD'] %>
        ```

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Image Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents deployment of tampered images.
*   **Use of Untrusted Images (Severity: High):** Enforces the use of images from your controlled registry.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Image Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination if signing is properly implemented).
*   **Use of Untrusted Images:** Risk eliminated (if registry access is properly controlled).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in with your project's specifics):** None

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in with your project's specifics):**
    *   No `pre-deploy` hook for signature verification.
    *   Registry credentials might be hardcoded or insecurely stored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Secret Management (Kamal `secrets` Feature & Environment Variables)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_secret_management__kamal__secrets__feature_&_environment_variables_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use Kamal's `secrets` Feature:**
    *   Store sensitive values in a `.env` file *locally* (never commit this file).
    *   Use `kamal envify` to create an encrypted `.env.enc` file: `kamal envify > .env.enc`.
    *   Generate a strong, random `KAMAL_KEY` and store it *securely* (e.g., in a secret manager, *not* in the repository or a local `.env` file).
    *   Use `kamal env push` to upload the encrypted secrets to the servers: `kamal env push`.
    *   Ensure your application loads environment variables correctly.
2.  **External Secret Manager Integration (Environment Variables):**
    *   If using an external secret manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.), configure your application to retrieve secrets at runtime.
    *   Use Kamal's environment variable handling to pass the necessary connection details (e.g., secret manager endpoint, authentication tokens) to your application.  *Do not* hardcode these in `config/deploy.yml`.  Use the `<%= ENV['...'] %>` syntax.
        ```yaml
        env:
          clear:
            SECRET_MANAGER_ENDPOINT: <%= ENV['SECRET_MANAGER_ENDPOINT'] %>
            SECRET_MANAGER_TOKEN: <%= ENV['SECRET_MANAGER_TOKEN'] %>
        ```
3. **Avoid Hardcoding in `config/deploy.yml`:** Ensure no secrets are directly present in your `config/deploy.yml` file.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Protects secrets from being exposed in the repository or configuration.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access based on leaked credentials.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with proper use of `kamal secrets` and a secure `KAMAL_KEY` storage).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on the security of the secret manager and access controls).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example):** Using `kamal envify` and `kamal env push`, but `KAMAL_KEY` is stored insecurely.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example):**
    *   `KAMAL_KEY` is not stored in a secret manager.
    *   Integration with an external secret manager is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Traefik Configuration (Kamal Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_traefik_configuration__kamal_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Verify TLS/SSL Configuration:**
    *   Ensure Kamal's Let's Encrypt integration is working correctly.  Check that your application is accessible via HTTPS and that the certificate is valid.
    *   If using custom certificates, configure them correctly in Kamal's `config/deploy.yml`.
2.  **Customize Traefik Middlewares (Kamal Configuration):**
    *   Use Traefik middlewares to enhance security.  This is done within the `traefik.options` section of your `config/deploy.yml`. Examples:
        *   **Rate Limiting:**
            ```yaml
            traefik:
              options:
                "traefik.http.middlewares.ratelimit.ratelimit.average": "100"
                "traefik.http.middlewares.ratelimit.ratelimit.burst": "200"
                "traefik.http.middlewares.ratelimit.ratelimit.period": "1s"
                "traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares": "ratelimit"
            ```
        *   **Security Headers:**
            ```yaml
            traefik:
              options:
                "traefik.http.middlewares.security-headers.headers.stsSeconds": "31536000"
                "traefik.http.middlewares.security-headers.headers.contentTypeNosniff": "true"
                "traefik.http.middlewares.security-headers.headers.frameDeny": "true"
                "traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares": "security-headers"
            ```
        *   **Basic Authentication (if needed):**
            ```yaml
            traefik:
              options:
                "traefik.http.middlewares.auth.basicauth.users": "user:hashed_password" # Use htpasswd to generate hashed_password
                "traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares": "auth"
            ```
    *   Consult the Traefik documentation for a complete list of available middlewares and their configuration options.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: Critical):** TLS/SSL encryption protects against eavesdropping and data tampering.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`) can mitigate XSS attacks.
*   **Clickjacking (Severity: Medium):** The `X-Frame-Options` header can prevent clickjacking attacks.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Rate limiting can mitigate brute-force attacks against login forms.
* **Unauthorized access (Severity: High):** Basic authentication can protect endpoints.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk eliminated (with proper TLS/SSL configuration).
*   **XSS, Clickjacking, Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on the specific middlewares used).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example):** Basic TLS/SSL configuration via Let's Encrypt.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example):**
    *   No custom Traefik middlewares are configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kamal Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kamal_hooks.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review and Minimize Hook Logic:** Carefully review all custom Kamal hooks for potential security vulnerabilities.  Keep the logic as simple and concise as possible. Avoid complex shell scripting within hooks.
2.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure hooks run with the minimum necessary privileges.  If a hook needs to interact with Docker, it should ideally run as the same user that Kamal uses for deployments (which should *not* be `root`).  Avoid using `sudo` within hooks unless absolutely necessary.
3. **Avoid Command Injection:** Be extremely careful when constructing commands within hooks, especially if they involve user-supplied input (e.g., environment variables). Use proper quoting and escaping to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Prefer using built-in Kamal variables (like `$KAMAL_VERSION`) over constructing commands from scratch.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Hook Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code via hooks.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the potential for attackers to gain elevated privileges through hooks.
*   **Command Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Hook Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (with careful review and least privilege).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (dependent on hook permissions).
*   **Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (with proper input sanitization and escaping).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example):** None

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example):**
    *   Hooks are not reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Hooks might run with excessive privileges.
    *   Potential command injection vulnerabilities might exist in hooks.
