### High and Critical Sidekiq Threats

This list focuses on high and critical security threats directly involving the Sidekiq library.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Job Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious jobs into the Sidekiq queues. This could be done if the attacker gains unauthorized access to Redis or if the application's job enqueueing process has vulnerabilities. The malicious job could contain code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in worker processes or other parts of the application *through Sidekiq's execution mechanism*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on worker servers, data manipulation, denial of service by overloading workers with malicious tasks, potential for privilege escalation if worker processes have excessive permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq's queue management, job serialization/deserialization, worker processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Redis instance to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for data used in job arguments *before enqueuing with Sidekiq*.
        *   Use secure serialization formats for job arguments (avoiding formats prone to deserialization vulnerabilities).
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to worker processes.
        *   Monitor job queues for suspicious or unexpected entries.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments
    *   **Description:** If job arguments are serialized using insecure methods (e.g., `Marshal` in Ruby without proper safeguards) and *passed to Sidekiq*, an attacker could craft malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized by a worker, lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on worker servers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq's job deserialization process within worker processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer secure serialization formats like JSON *when working with Sidekiq*.
        *   If using formats like `Marshal`, ensure that the data being deserialized originates from a trusted source and is cryptographically signed or verified *before being processed by Sidekiq*.
        *   Keep the Ruby version and any serialization libraries up to date with security patches.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Jobs
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects jobs designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the worker servers *through Sidekiq*. This could lead to denial of service for the worker pool, preventing legitimate jobs from being processed.
    *   **Impact:** Delayed or failed processing of background tasks, potential impact on application functionality relying on these tasks, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq worker processes, the underlying server infrastructure *managed by Sidekiq*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits for worker processes (e.g., using process control groups or containerization).
        *   Set timeouts for job execution *within Sidekiq worker configurations* to prevent runaway processes.
        *   Monitor worker resource usage and alert on anomalies.
        *   Implement queue prioritization *within Sidekiq* to ensure critical jobs are processed even under load.

*   **Threat:** Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Sidekiq Web UI (Pro/Enterprise)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the Sidekiq Pro/Enterprise web UI could allow unauthorized users to access the UI and perform actions they are not permitted to *within the Sidekiq management interface*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to job monitoring and management features, potential for malicious manipulation of queues *through the Sidekiq UI*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq Web UI (Pro/Enterprise) authentication and authorization modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and unique credentials for accessing the web UI.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks to ensure users only have access to the features they need.
        *   Keep Sidekiq Pro/Enterprise updated to the latest version with security patches.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Job Scheduling via Sidekiq-Cron
    *   **Description:** If using Sidekiq-Cron, an attacker who gains access to the scheduling configuration could schedule malicious jobs to be executed at specific times *by Sidekiq*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on worker servers at scheduled intervals, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq-Cron scheduling mechanism, Redis storage of cron jobs *used by Sidekiq*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the Sidekiq-Cron configuration (e.g., through environment variables or secure configuration files).
        *   Implement validation for scheduled job definitions to prevent the scheduling of obviously malicious tasks.
        *   Monitor the scheduled jobs for unexpected or suspicious entries.
