**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HRP, CN] Exploit Sidekiq Job Processing:**

*   This represents the high-risk path of compromising the application by manipulating the core job processing mechanism of Sidekiq.
*   It is a critical node because it's the central function of Sidekiq and a prime target for exploitation.

**2. [HRP, CN] Inject Malicious Job:**

*   This is a high-risk path involving the injection of specially crafted jobs into the Sidekiq queue.
*   It is a critical node because successful injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server.

**3. [CN] Gain Access to Redis:**

*   This is a critical node because access to Redis is a prerequisite for several high-risk attacks.
*   Attack vectors include:
    *   Exploiting application vulnerabilities to enqueue arbitrary jobs, allowing the attacker to insert malicious payloads.
    *   Compromising the internal network to directly access the Redis instance.

**4. [CN] Craft Malicious Payload:**

*   This is a critical node representing the step where the attacker creates the malicious data to be injected into a job.
*   The primary attack vector involves leveraging Ruby's `Marshal.load` vulnerability by injecting "gadgets" - existing classes within the application or its dependencies that can be chained together to achieve code execution.

**5. [HRP] Poison Existing Jobs:**

*   This is a high-risk path where an attacker gains access to Redis and modifies existing jobs in the queue.
*   When these poisoned jobs are processed by Sidekiq workers, the malicious modifications can lead to unintended and harmful consequences, including RCE.

**6. [HRP] Exploit Sidekiq Web UI (IF ENABLED):**

*   This is a high-risk path if the Sidekiq Web UI is enabled, as it provides a management interface that can be exploited.

**7. [HRP, CN] Authentication Bypass:**

*   This is a high-risk path and a critical node because successfully bypassing authentication on the Web UI grants the attacker unauthorized access to manage Sidekiq.
*   The primary attack vector is exploiting default credentials that have not been changed.

**8. [HRP, CN] Default Credentials (If Not Changed):**

*   This is a high-risk path and a critical node because it represents a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   If the default username and password for the Sidekiq Web UI are not changed, an attacker can trivially gain access.

**9. [CN] Exposed Configuration Files (e.g., `.env` files):**

*   This is a critical node because exposed configuration files often contain sensitive information, such as Redis connection details (including passwords).
*   Attack vectors involve finding publicly accessible configuration files due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

**10. [HRP] Exploit Dependencies of Sidekiq:**

*   This is a high-risk path because Sidekiq relies heavily on Redis, and vulnerabilities in Redis can directly compromise the application.

**11. [HRP, CN] Vulnerabilities in Redis:**

*   This is a high-risk path and a critical node because exploiting vulnerabilities in Redis can have severe consequences.
*   Attack vectors include:
    *   **Exploit Redis Command Injection:** If the application constructs Redis commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary Redis commands.
    *   **[HRP, CN] Exploit Redis Authentication Bypass (If Weakly Configured):** If Redis is not configured with strong authentication or uses weak passwords, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Exploit Known Redis Vulnerabilities (Requires Outdated Version):** Using an outdated version of Redis exposes the application to known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
