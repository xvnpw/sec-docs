# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement HTTP Basic Authentication for Sidekiq Dashboard](./mitigation_strategies/implement_http_basic_authentication_for_sidekiq_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure your web server or application framework to intercept requests to the `/sidekiq` path.
    2.  Set up HTTP Basic Authentication requiring users to provide a username and password.
    3.  Define a secure username and password combination specifically for Sidekiq dashboard access.
    4.  Ensure these credentials are stored securely and not hardcoded in the application.
    5.  Restrict access to authorized personnel who need to monitor Sidekiq.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Job Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing sensitive job information, queue status, and worker details exposed through the dashboard.
    *   **Potential Manipulation of Queues (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized users potentially manipulating queues or triggering actions via the dashboard if such functionality is exposed.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental or malicious exposure of internal application workings and job processing details to unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Job Data (High Risk Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by requiring authentication.
    *   **Potential Manipulation of Queues (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces risk by limiting access, although dashboard manipulation is not the primary attack vector for queue manipulation.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces risk by limiting access to sensitive operational information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, in `config/routes.rb` using Rails route constraints with HTTP Basic Authentication for `/sidekiq` path.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Currently implemented for basic access control. Could be enhanced with RBAC for finer-grained permissions in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Sidekiq Dashboard](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_sidekiq_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate an RBAC system into your application.
    2.  Define roles and permissions related to Sidekiq dashboard access (e.g., "admin", "developer", "operations").
    3.  Modify your application to check user roles before granting access to the `/sidekiq` dashboard.
    4.  Allow only users with specific roles (e.g., "admin", "operations") to access the dashboard.
    5.  This provides more granular control than basic authentication for Sidekiq dashboard access.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Job Data (High Severity):**  Further restricts access based on roles, ensuring only truly authorized personnel can view the dashboard.
    *   **Potential Manipulation of Queues (Medium Severity):**  Reinforces access control, making unauthorized manipulation even harder.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Limits information exposure to only those with necessary roles.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Job Data (High Risk Reduction):**  Provides stronger access control than basic auth, especially in larger teams.
    *   **Potential Manipulation of Queues (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Further reduces risk by enforcing role-based permissions.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Enhances control over who can view sensitive operational data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Currently using HTTP Basic Authentication.
*   **Missing Implementation:** RBAC is missing. Could be implemented in `ApplicationController` and `routes.rb` to check user roles before allowing access to the Sidekiq dashboard.

    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious code through job arguments that are later executed by Sidekiq workers.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures Sidekiq jobs are processed with valid and expected data, preventing unexpected behavior and errors in job execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Risk Reduction):**  Significantly reduces risk by preventing malicious data from entering Sidekiq's processing pipeline.
    *   **Code Injection (High Risk Reduction):**  Majorly reduces risk by sanitizing input and validating data types processed by Sidekiq workers.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption needs to be implemented for Sidekiq jobs handling sensitive data. This requires identifying sensitive arguments, choosing an encryption method, implementing encryption/decryption logic in job enqueuing and worker processing, and secure key management for Sidekiq job data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Job Creation](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_job_creation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify points in your application where jobs are enqueued into Sidekiq, especially those triggered by user actions or external events.

    3.  Use a rate limiting library or implement custom logic.
    4.  Configure appropriate rate limits based on your Sidekiq application's capacity and expected load.

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review Sidekiq job worker code to ensure secure coding practices are followed.
    2.  Apply the principle of least privilege to Sidekiq workers: workers should only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid running workers as root or with overly broad permissions.
    3.  If Sidekiq jobs interact with external systems or APIs, implement robust authentication, authorization, and input validation for these interactions within the worker logic.
    4.  Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval`, `instance_eval`) within Sidekiq job workers, especially when processing user-provided or external data.
