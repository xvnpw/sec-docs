## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sidekiq Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sidekiq_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security via Sidekiq vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Job Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_job_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that leverage weaknesses in how the application processes jobs using Sidekiq. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Job Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_job_data__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to insert malicious data into job arguments. This data is then processed by job handlers, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.
    * **Via External Input (e.g., Web Form, API) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting external interfaces (web forms, APIs) that feed data into job queues.
        * **Exploit Input Validation Flaws [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Insufficient Sanitization/Escaping [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:**  Failing to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before using it in job handlers. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities when the data is processed.
            * **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using unsafe formats like YAML/Marshal) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:** Using unsafe deserialization formats like YAML or Marshal to process job arguments, especially if the data originates from untrusted sources. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) during deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Job Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_job_code__critical_node_.md)

This category targets vulnerabilities within the code of the job handlers themselves.

    * **Code Injection within Job Handlers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into job handlers to be executed by Sidekiq workers.
        * **Unsafe use of `eval`, `system`, `exec` with job data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Using unsafe functions like `eval`, `system`, or `exec` within job handlers with job data that is not properly validated or sanitized. This directly allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        * **Vulnerable Dependencies used within Job Handlers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Job handlers relying on vulnerable third-party libraries. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Redis Interaction Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_redis_interaction_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that exploit weaknesses in the interaction between Sidekiq and Redis.

    * **Compromise Redis Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Directly compromising the Redis server that Sidekiq depends on.
        * **Unsecured Redis Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Default Password/No Authentication [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:** Redis server configured with default credentials or no authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
            * **Publicly Accessible Redis Port [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:** Redis port exposed to the public internet without proper firewall restrictions, allowing unauthorized access.
        * **Redis Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Exploit known Redis server vulnerabilities (if outdated version) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:** Running an outdated version of Redis with known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

    * **Manipulate Redis Data Directly [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to Redis data (via compromised Redis or application vulnerabilities) and directly manipulating job queues, schedules, or Sidekiq configuration.
        * **Gain Access to Redis Data (via compromised Redis or application) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Achieving unauthorized access to Redis data, either by compromising the Redis server itself or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application that allow access to Redis.
        * **Modify Job Queues, Schedules, or Configuration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Inject Malicious Jobs directly into queues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Attack Vector:** Directly injecting malicious job payloads into Sidekiq queues, bypassing normal application enqueueing processes. This allows for immediate execution of attacker-controlled code by Sidekiq workers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Deployment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_deployment_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices related to Sidekiq.

    * **Misconfiguration of Sidekiq [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Insecure Redis Connection String (e.g., exposed credentials) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Storing Redis credentials insecurely in the Sidekiq connection string (e.g., hardcoded in configuration files or easily accessible environment variables). This allows attackers to easily obtain Redis credentials and compromise the Redis server.

    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit vulnerabilities in Sidekiq's dependencies (e.g., Rack, Redis client) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Sidekiq depends on, such as Rack or the Redis client library.

    * **Environment Variable Exposure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Sensitive information (Redis credentials, API keys) exposed via environment variables accessible to Sidekiq process [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Storing sensitive information like Redis credentials or API keys in environment variables that are accessible to the Sidekiq process and potentially to attackers. If environment variable access is compromised, attackers can obtain these sensitive credentials and compromise related systems.
