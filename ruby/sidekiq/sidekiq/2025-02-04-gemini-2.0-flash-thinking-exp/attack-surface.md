# Attack Surface Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Redis Instance](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_redis_instance.md)

*   **Description:** The Redis instance used by Sidekiq lacks proper authentication and network security, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation.
*   **Sidekiq Contribution:** Sidekiq *requires* a Redis instance and relies on its security.  Sidekiq stores all job data, queues, and potentially sensitive application data within Redis. An unsecured Redis instance becomes a direct and critical vulnerability point for Sidekiq-based applications.
*   **Example:** A Redis instance running without a password, accessible on a public network. Attackers can connect, directly access Sidekiq queues, inspect job arguments (potentially containing sensitive data), inject malicious jobs, or disrupt job processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Exposure of sensitive data stored in job arguments or Sidekiq metadata within Redis.
    *   Data Manipulation: Attackers can alter job payloads, delete jobs, or inject malicious jobs, compromising application logic and data integrity.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Flooding Redis with invalid jobs or commands, causing performance degradation or complete service disruption for Sidekiq and potentially the entire application.
    *   Remote Code Execution (Potential): By injecting jobs designed to exploit insecure deserialization or other vulnerabilities in worker code.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Strong Redis Authentication:** Configure Redis to require a strong password using the `requirepass` directive.
    *   **Network Isolation for Redis:** Restrict network access to the Redis instance. Ensure it's only accessible from trusted sources (e.g., application servers, internal network) using firewalls and network configurations. Utilize Redis's `bind` directive to limit listening interfaces.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Redis):**  If possible, dedicate a Redis instance solely for Sidekiq. Limit Redis user permissions to the minimum required for Sidekiq's operation.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Redis Configuration:** Periodically review Redis security configurations and access controls to ensure they remain robust.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Job Payloads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_job_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** Sidekiq, particularly in Ruby environments, may use insecure deserialization methods like `Marshal` by default. This allows attackers to inject malicious serialized objects into job payloads, leading to arbitrary code execution when workers process these jobs.
*   **Sidekiq Contribution:** Sidekiq's core function is to deserialize job payloads to execute worker code. The default (or unconsidered) use of vulnerable deserialization methods like `Marshal` directly introduces a critical vulnerability within Sidekiq's processing pipeline.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a job enqueueing mechanism or directly manipulates Redis to insert a job with a malicious Ruby object serialized using `Marshal` as a job argument. When a Sidekiq worker retrieves and processes this job, `Marshal.load` deserializes the object, triggering remote code execution on the worker server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers can execute arbitrary code on Sidekiq worker servers, gaining full control.
    *   Full System Compromise: RCE on worker servers can lead to complete compromise of those systems and potentially the wider application infrastructure if workers have network access.
    *   Data Breaches, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service: As consequences of successful RCE, attackers can perform various malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate `Marshal` Deserialization:**  Avoid using `Marshal` for job serialization entirely. Switch to safer alternatives like JSON or other formats that are not inherently vulnerable to deserialization attacks. Sidekiq Pro offers JSON serialization. For open-source Sidekiq, implement custom serialization using safe formats.
    *   **Input Validation (Even with Safer Serialization):**  Even with safer serialization formats, rigorously validate and sanitize all job arguments within worker code to prevent other forms of injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Workers):** Run Sidekiq worker processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage in case of successful RCE.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Sidekiq, Ruby, and all dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities, including those related to serialization.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities via Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_via_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Worker code processes job arguments passed by Sidekiq. If worker code doesn't properly validate and sanitize these arguments before using them in operations (like shell commands, database queries, etc.), injection vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Sidekiq Contribution:** Sidekiq is the delivery mechanism for job arguments to worker code. While Sidekiq itself doesn't introduce the *vulnerability* in worker code, it directly *facilitates* the delivery of potentially malicious data that can trigger these vulnerabilities if worker code is not secure.
*   **Example:** A worker receives a `file_path` argument. The worker code naively executes a shell command: `system("convert #{file_path} output.png")`. An attacker can inject a malicious `file_path` like `"image.jpg; rm -rf /"` to execute arbitrary commands on the server via command injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection: Remote code execution, system compromise.
    *   SQL Injection: Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to databases.
    *   Other Injection Types: Depending on how job arguments are used in worker code, various injection vulnerabilities (LDAP, etc.) are possible, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* job arguments within worker code *before* they are used in any operations, especially those interacting with external systems, databases, or executing commands.
    *   **Parameterized Queries for Databases:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection. Never construct SQL queries by directly concatenating job arguments.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:** Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically construct and execute shell commands based on job arguments. If absolutely necessary, use secure libraries and extremely carefully sanitize inputs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Workers):** Limit the privileges of Sidekiq worker processes to reduce the potential impact of successful injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Sidekiq Web UI](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_sidekiq_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:** If enabled, the Sidekiq Web UI provides a web interface for monitoring and managing Sidekiq. Lack of proper authentication and authorization exposes sensitive information and management capabilities to unauthorized users.
*   **Sidekiq Contribution:** Sidekiq offers an optional Web UI. Enabling this UI without strong security measures directly creates a web-based attack surface that is part of the Sidekiq deployment.
*   **Example:** The Sidekiq Web UI is enabled and accessible without any authentication. Attackers can access it to view job queues, processing statistics, job details (potentially including sensitive arguments), retry or discard jobs, and potentially gain insights into application logic and operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Exposure of job details, application logic, operational information, and potentially sensitive data within job arguments.
    *   Job Manipulation: Attackers can manipulate job queues (retry, discard jobs), potentially disrupting application functionality or causing denial of service.
    *   Potential for Further Exploitation: If the Web UI itself has vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF), attackers could leverage unauthorized access to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication and Authorization:** Always enable strong authentication for the Sidekiq Web UI. Use robust authentication mechanisms and implement proper authorization to control access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Network Isolation for Web UI:** Restrict network access to the Web UI to trusted networks or specific IP addresses. Consider running it on a separate, internal management network.
    *   **Regular Updates for Web UI Components:** Ensure Sidekiq and its Web UI components are kept up-to-date to patch any potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Web UI if Unnecessary:** If the Web UI is not actively required for monitoring and management, consider disabling it entirely to eliminate this attack surface.
