# Threat Model Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Threat: [Unintended Job Enqueueing](./threats/unintended_job_enqueueing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's job enqueueing logic to bypass authorization and enqueue jobs directly into Sidekiq queues. This allows them to trigger execution of arbitrary jobs by Sidekiq workers, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Execution of unauthorized code by Sidekiq workers, unintended application behavior, data manipulation, resource consumption, and potential system compromise due to malicious job execution.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Sidekiq Client, Job Enqueueing Process, Sidekiq Queues.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks at the application level before allowing job enqueueing.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs used in job enqueueing logic to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to API access and job enqueueing permissions.
    *   Regularly audit job enqueueing logic and API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Job Data Tampering in Redis](./threats/job_data_tampering_in_redis.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Sidekiq. By directly manipulating the Redis data structures that Sidekiq uses for job queues, the attacker can alter job arguments, modify job execution flow, or inject malicious payloads into jobs processed by Sidekiq workers.
*   **Impact:**  Manipulation of Sidekiq job execution, execution of jobs with attacker-controlled parameters, data corruption within the application due to altered job processing, potential privilege escalation if job arguments are manipulated to bypass security checks, and disruption of Sidekiq job processing.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis (used by Sidekiq), Sidekiq Queues, Redis Connection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Redis access with strong passwords or authentication mechanisms (like Redis ACLs).
    *   Restrict network access to the Redis instance to only authorized systems (e.g., Sidekiq workers, application servers) using firewalls.
    *   Regularly audit Redis security configurations and access logs.
    *   Consider using TLS encryption for Redis connections to protect data in transit.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within job arguments before storing them in Redis.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Job Arguments](./threats/code_injection_via_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious job arguments that, when processed by Sidekiq workers, are interpreted as code and executed within the worker's environment. This is particularly dangerous if job code dynamically evaluates or executes arguments without proper sanitization, leading to remote code execution on the Sidekiq worker server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Sidekiq worker servers, full compromise of worker processes and potentially the underlying infrastructure, data breaches, and complete service disruption.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Sidekiq Worker, Job Code, Job Argument Processing within Workers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** use `eval` or similar dynamic code execution functions directly with job arguments.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all job arguments within the job code before processing them.
    *   Use parameterized queries or safe APIs when interacting with external systems or databases from within jobs.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to Sidekiq worker processes, limiting their access to sensitive system resources.
    *   Implement input validation libraries and frameworks to help sanitize job arguments effectively.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Sidekiq Worker Environment](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_sidekiq_worker_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Sidekiq workers rely on a specific runtime environment with dependencies (libraries, gems, system packages). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies within the worker environment can be exploited by attackers. They might craft specific job arguments or trigger execution paths in jobs that interact with vulnerable dependency code, leading to compromise of the worker.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Sidekiq worker servers, denial of service, information disclosure, and other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Exploitation can lead to full control of the worker process and potentially the server.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Sidekiq Worker Environment, Dependencies (Gems, Libraries, System Packages used by workers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies (gems, libraries, system packages) in the Sidekiq worker environment to the latest secure versions.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in worker dependencies.
    *   Establish a robust patch management process for Sidekiq worker servers to promptly apply security updates.
    *   Minimize the number of dependencies in the worker environment to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Use containerization (like Docker) to create consistent and controlled worker environments, making dependency management easier and more secure.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Redis Access](./threats/unauthorized_redis_access.md)

*   **Description:** If the Redis instance used by Sidekiq is not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized network access. This direct access to Redis, the backbone of Sidekiq's queue system, allows attackers to bypass application-level security and directly manipulate Sidekiq's operations at a fundamental level.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Sidekiq queues and job processing, manipulation of job data, information disclosure of job arguments and metadata, denial of service by deleting or modifying jobs, and potential for further exploitation of the application or infrastructure due to compromised background processing.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis (used by Sidekiq), Redis Connection, Sidekiq Queues.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication for Redis access using passwords or Redis ACLs.
    *   Strictly restrict network access to the Redis port (default 6379) using firewalls, allowing only necessary IPs (Sidekiq workers, application servers).
    *   Regularly audit Redis security configurations and monitor access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Consider using TLS encryption for all communication between Sidekiq components and Redis to protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.

## Threat: [Redis Data Exposure](./threats/redis_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data might be inadvertently stored within job arguments or metadata in Redis, which Sidekiq uses as its data store. If Redis is compromised due to unauthorized access or insecure backups, this sensitive data becomes exposed to attackers, leading to confidentiality breaches.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive personal data, API keys, credentials, or business-critical information stored within Sidekiq job data in Redis. This can lead to reputational damage, legal/regulatory compliance violations, and further attacks leveraging the exposed sensitive information.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis (used by Sidekiq), Job Data stored in Redis, Redis Persistence, Backups of Redis data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in job arguments or Redis keys whenever possible.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in job arguments or Redis. Decrypt it only within the secure context of the Sidekiq worker when needed.
    *   Implement secure backup procedures for Redis data, ensuring backups are encrypted and stored in a secure location with restricted access.
    *   Apply data minimization principles; only store the absolutely necessary data in job arguments and Redis.
    *   Regularly audit job data and Redis keys to identify and remove any unintentionally stored sensitive information.
    *   Consider data masking or tokenization techniques for sensitive data within job arguments if full removal is not feasible.
