# Threat Model Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Threat: [Job Data Tampering in Redis](./threats/job_data_tampering_in_redis.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Sidekiq. They can then directly modify job data stored in Redis queues. This could involve changing job arguments, queue names, or other job metadata. The attacker might aim to manipulate application behavior by altering job execution flow or injecting malicious data into worker processes.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within the application, application malfunction due to unexpected job behavior, potential for unauthorized actions to be performed by workers based on manipulated job data, leading to business logic failures or security breaches.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis Storage (specifically, the queues and job data stored in Redis).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Redis access using strong passwords and network firewalls.
    *   Implement Redis ACLs to restrict access to Sidekiq-specific keys and commands for Sidekiq users.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within job arguments before enqueuing and decrypt within workers.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within worker code to handle potentially unexpected or malicious data.
    *   Regularly audit Redis access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Message Queue Poisoning](./threats/message_queue_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker enqueues specially crafted jobs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in worker code or application logic. These poisoned messages could contain malicious payloads or trigger unexpected behavior when processed by workers. The attacker's goal could be denial of service, data manipulation, or even remote code execution if worker code is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Application instability, denial of service by overloading workers with malicious jobs, data corruption if poisoned jobs manipulate data, potential for code execution if worker code is vulnerable to injection attacks based on job data.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job Enqueueing Process, Worker Code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization within worker code to handle job arguments.
    *   Enforce authorization checks before enqueuing jobs to ensure only authorized users or processes can add jobs to the queue.
    *   Implement rate limiting on job enqueueing to prevent job flooding attacks.
    *   Consider using signed or encrypted job payloads to verify integrity and authenticity of jobs.

## Threat: [Redis Downtime](./threats/redis_downtime.md)

*   **Description:**  Sidekiq relies entirely on Redis for job queuing and processing. If the Redis instance becomes unavailable due to hardware failure, network issues, misconfiguration, or a denial-of-service attack targeting Redis, Sidekiq will cease to function.  An attacker might target Redis directly to disrupt the application's background processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Complete disruption of background job processing, delayed execution of critical tasks, application functionality degradation or failure if reliant on background jobs, potential data loss if jobs are not persisted before Redis failure.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis Dependency (Sidekiq's reliance on Redis).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Redis replication and failover mechanisms for high availability (e.g., Redis Sentinel or Cluster).
    *   Monitor Redis health and performance proactively using monitoring tools.
    *   Plan for Redis maintenance windows and implement graceful degradation strategies in the application to handle temporary Redis unavailability.
    *   Use persistent Redis configuration (AOF or RDB) to minimize data loss in case of Redis failure.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory, Redis Connections)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__cpu__memory__redis_connections_.md)

*   **Description:** A large volume of jobs, inefficient worker code, or a malicious job flooding attack can overwhelm system resources (CPU, memory, Redis connections) used by Sidekiq and Redis. This can lead to performance degradation, service outages, or even system crashes. An attacker might intentionally flood the system with jobs to exhaust resources and cause a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Slow job processing, application instability, denial of service, Redis performance issues, potential system crashes due to resource exhaustion, impacting overall application availability.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Worker Processes, Redis Instance, System Resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on job enqueueing to control the job inflow.
    *   Optimize worker code for efficiency and minimize resource usage.
    *   Properly configure Sidekiq worker concurrency and Redis connection pool size based on system capacity.
    *   Monitor system resource utilization (CPU, memory, Redis connections) and scale resources as needed.
    *   Implement circuit breaker patterns in worker code to prevent cascading failures and resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Job Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_job_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intentionally enqueues a massive number of jobs, overwhelming Sidekiq workers and Redis. This flood of jobs can saturate resources, slow down or halt job processing, and potentially crash the system. The attacker's goal is to make the application unavailable by disrupting its background processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, delayed job processing, system instability, resource exhaustion, impacting critical application functionalities reliant on background jobs.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job Enqueueing Process, Worker Pool, Redis Instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust rate limiting on job enqueueing, especially from public-facing endpoints.
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for job enqueueing endpoints to prevent unauthorized job submission.
    *   Use queue prioritization to ensure critical jobs are processed even under load.
    *   Monitor queue lengths and worker performance to detect and respond to job flooding attacks in real-time.
    *   Implement input validation on job arguments to prevent processing of excessively large or complex jobs that could contribute to resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Job Data in Redis](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_job_data_in_redis.md)

*   **Description:** Job arguments and payloads are stored in Redis, potentially containing sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, or personal data. If Redis is compromised or access is not properly controlled, this sensitive data could be exposed to unauthorized parties. An attacker gaining access to Redis could directly read job data and extract sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious activities if exposed data is misused.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis Storage (job data in queues).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Redis access with strong passwords, network restrictions, and ACLs.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within job arguments before enqueuing and decrypt within the worker.
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in job arguments if possible. Consider using references (IDs) to data stored securely elsewhere.
    *   Regularly audit Redis access logs for suspicious activity and potential data breaches.

## Threat: [Unsecured Redis Access](./threats/unsecured_redis_access.md)

*   **Description:** If Redis is not properly secured (e.g., default password, publicly accessible, no ACLs), unauthorized users can access and manipulate Sidekiq queues, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious actions. An attacker could exploit misconfigured Redis instances to gain full control over Sidekiq's operation.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized job manipulation, complete compromise of Sidekiq functionality and potentially the application relying on it.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis Dependency, Redis Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set a strong, unique password for Redis authentication.
    *   Restrict network access to Redis using firewalls and private networks, ensuring it's not publicly accessible.
    *   Use Redis ACLs to limit access to specific keys and commands for different users/applications, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit Redis security configuration and ensure it aligns with security best practices.

## Threat: [Lack of Job Enqueue Authorization](./threats/lack_of_job_enqueue_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** If there are no authorization checks in place before enqueuing jobs, any user or process, even unauthorized ones, could enqueue jobs. This can lead to abuse, data manipulation, or denial of service. An attacker could exploit publicly accessible job enqueueing endpoints to inject malicious jobs or flood the system with unwanted tasks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed by workers, data corruption due to malicious jobs, denial of service by overloading the system with unwanted jobs, resource exhaustion, potential for business logic bypass or abuse.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job Enqueueing Process, Application API Endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization checks before enqueuing jobs, verifying user permissions or application context.
    *   Use API keys, OAuth, or other authentication mechanisms to control access to job enqueueing endpoints.
    *   Log and monitor job enqueueing activity for suspicious patterns and unauthorized attempts.
    *   Design job enqueueing APIs to be secure by default, requiring authentication and authorization for all enqueue requests.
