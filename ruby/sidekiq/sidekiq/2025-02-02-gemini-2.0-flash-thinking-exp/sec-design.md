# BUSINESS POSTURE

Sidekiq is a background job processing library for Ruby. It is designed to perform asynchronous tasks outside of the main request-response cycle of web applications. By offloading tasks to Sidekiq, web applications can remain responsive and handle user requests quickly, while background tasks are processed in the background.

Business priorities and goals that Sidekiq addresses:
- Improve web application responsiveness and user experience by offloading time-consuming tasks.
- Enhance application scalability by processing background jobs asynchronously and independently of web servers.
- Increase application reliability by ensuring background tasks are processed even if web servers are busy or unavailable.
- Simplify development of applications requiring background processing capabilities.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Job processing failures: If background jobs fail to process correctly, it can lead to data inconsistencies, missed business logic execution, and impact business operations.
- Data loss: If jobs are not reliably enqueued or processed, data associated with those jobs might be lost, leading to incomplete transactions or business process failures.
- Security vulnerabilities in job processing: If job processing logic is vulnerable, it can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt application functionality.
- Operational complexity: Managing and monitoring background job processing infrastructure can add operational complexity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open source code - publicly available for review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Community contributions - benefits from community security reviews and patches. Implemented: GitHub community.
- security control: Redis security - relies on Redis security features for data storage and access control. Implemented: Redis configuration and deployment.
- security control: Standard Ruby security practices - follows general secure coding practices for Ruby applications. Implemented: Codebase.
- security control: Dependency management - uses Bundler for managing dependencies and potentially addressing known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Implemented: Gemfile and Bundler.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Redis security - security posture is dependent on the security configuration and management of the Redis instance.
- accepted risk: Open source vulnerabilities - potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase or dependencies.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration - risk of misconfiguring Sidekiq or Redis leading to security issues.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Regular security audits - conduct periodic security audits of the Sidekiq codebase and its dependencies.
- security control: Automated security scanning - integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the development and CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Secure job serialization - ensure job arguments are serialized and deserialized securely to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Rate limiting and throttling - implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms for job processing to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- security control: Monitoring and alerting - implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for Sidekiq and Redis to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Access to the Sidekiq web UI should be authenticated to prevent unauthorized access to job monitoring and management features.
    - Requirement: If Sidekiq processes sensitive data, consider authentication and authorization mechanisms for job enqueueing to ensure only authorized applications can submit jobs.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization should be implemented in the application code to control which users or services can enqueue specific types of jobs.
    - Requirement: Access to sensitive job data within Sidekiq processing logic should be authorized based on application-specific roles and permissions.
- Input validation:
    - Requirement: Job arguments should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed both at the job enqueueing stage and within the job processing logic.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data in job arguments should be encrypted at rest in Redis and during transit if necessary.
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices for encryption.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code changes on their workstation.
2. Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub Repository.
3. GitHub Repository triggers a GitHub Workflow (CI/CD pipeline).
4. GitHub Workflow starts a Build Environment.
5. Build Environment performs the following steps:
    - Fetches code from the GitHub Repository.
    - Builds the project artifacts (e.g., gems, Docker images).
    - Runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).
    - Performs security scans (SAST, dependency scanning, container image scanning).
    - Publishes build artifacts to an Artifact Repository (e.g., GitHub Packages, Gemfury, Docker Hub).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure development environment - developer workstations should be secured and regularly updated. Implemented: Developer workstation security policies.
- security control: Code review - code changes should be reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main branch. Implemented: GitHub Pull Request process.
- security control: Automated testing - automated tests should be run in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Implemented: GitHub Workflow, Test Environment.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - SAST tools should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: Security Scan step in GitHub Workflow.
- security control: Dependency scanning - dependency scanning tools should be used to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. Implemented: Security Scan step in GitHub Workflow.
- security control: Container image scanning - if Docker images are built, they should be scanned for vulnerabilities. Implemented: Security Scan step in GitHub Workflow.
- security control: Secure artifact repository - the artifact repository should be secured to prevent unauthorized access and tampering. Implemented: Artifact Repository access controls.
- security control: Build environment security - the build environment should be hardened and regularly updated. Implemented: Build Environment configuration and maintenance.
- security control: Supply chain security - minimize dependencies, use trusted sources for dependencies, and verify checksums of downloaded dependencies. Implemented: Dependency management practices, Gemfile.lock verification.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Sidekiq:
- Background processing of user actions (e.g., sending emails, processing payments, updating data).
- Scheduled tasks and maintenance operations.
- Asynchronous communication with external systems.
- Data synchronization and batch processing.

Data being protected and sensitivity:
- Job arguments: Can contain sensitive data depending on the application, such as user IDs, email addresses, payment information, API keys, and other business-critical data. Sensitivity varies depending on the data type and application context.
- Job metadata: Includes job status, queue names, timestamps, and other operational data. Less sensitive than job arguments but can still reveal information about application behavior.
- Redis data: All job data and metadata stored in Redis. Sensitivity is the same as job arguments.

Data sensitivity levels:
- High: Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, API keys, secrets. Requires encryption at rest and in transit, strict access control, and audit logging.
- Medium: Business-critical data, application configuration, operational data. Requires access control and monitoring.
- Low: Publicly available data, non-sensitive operational logs. Requires basic security measures.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Security is a concern for the project, and a threat model will be created based on this design document.
- The target deployment environment is a cloud-based infrastructure using containers and Kubernetes.
- Standard security best practices for open-source projects and web applications are applicable.
- The organization has a development team familiar with Ruby, Redis, and cloud deployments.
