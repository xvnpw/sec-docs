# Threat Model Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Threat: [Redis Data Breach](./threats/redis_data_breach.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Sidekiq.  This could be due to weak Redis passwords, misconfigured firewall rules, a compromised server, or a vulnerability in Redis itself. The attacker can then read, modify, or delete job data, including potentially sensitive information stored within job arguments.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure (including PII, API keys, etc.), job manipulation (leading to unauthorized actions), denial of service (by deleting jobs or overloading Redis), and potential escalation to other systems if Redis credentials are used elsewhere.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis connection and data storage (interaction with the Redis server, all Sidekiq operations relying on Redis).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if Redis is exposed and contains sensitive data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for Redis.
    *   Enable TLS/SSL for Redis connections.
    *   Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the Redis instance to only authorized servers (whitelisting).
    *   Regularly update Redis to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using Redis ACLs for fine-grained access control.
    *   Monitor Redis for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization (Marshal.load)](./threats/unsafe_deserialization__marshal_load_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controls the serialized data passed to Sidekiq, which is then deserialized using `Marshal.load`. This allows the attacker to inject malicious objects that can lead to remote code execution (RCE). This is particularly dangerous with the default (pre-Sidekiq 6.5) serializer. Even with safer serializers, vulnerabilities *could* exist, though they are much less likely.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the worker machines, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job deserialization (`Sidekiq::Client`, worker processes, the serializer used – specifically how Sidekiq handles incoming job data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if using `Marshal.load` and attacker-controlled input).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a safer serializer:** Switch to JSON serialization (e.g., using `Oj`, which is the default in Sidekiq 6.5+).
    *   **Whitelist allowed classes (if using Marshal):** If you *must* use `Marshal.load`, strictly limit the classes that can be deserialized using a whitelist. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Input validation:** Validate and sanitize all job arguments, even if using a safer serializer, as an extra layer of defense.

## Threat: [Dynamic Method Call Injection (Within Sidekiq Job)](./threats/dynamic_method_call_injection__within_sidekiq_job_.md)

*   **Description:**  Within the `perform` method (or methods called by it) of a Sidekiq job, an attacker controls job arguments that are used to construct method names or class names dynamically (e.g., `params[:class_name].constantize.send(params[:method_name])`). This allows the attacker to call arbitrary methods with arbitrary arguments, potentially leading to RCE or other unauthorized actions *within the context of the Sidekiq worker*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) within the Sidekiq worker, unauthorized data access or modification, and other unintended consequences depending on the methods called.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job code (specifically, the `perform` method and any methods it calls *within the Sidekiq worker process*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid dynamic method calls based on user input:** Use a whitelist of allowed methods and classes.
    *   **Strict input validation and sanitization:** Ensure that job arguments are of the expected type and format.
    *   **Use safer alternatives:** If you need to call methods dynamically, consider using a lookup table or a more controlled mechanism.

## Threat: [Job Flooding Denial of Service](./threats/job_flooding_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a large number of jobs to the Sidekiq queue, overwhelming the worker processes and preventing legitimate jobs from being processed. This directly impacts Sidekiq's ability to function.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, preventing the application from performing its intended functions that rely on Sidekiq. This can lead to business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Job queuing and processing (`Sidekiq::Client`, worker processes – specifically, Sidekiq's internal queue management and worker thread pool).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting *at the application level, before jobs are enqueued*.
    *   Use queue prioritization to ensure critical jobs are processed first.
    *   Set reasonable timeouts for jobs *within the Sidekiq job code*.
    *   Monitor worker resource usage and scale workers as needed.
    *   Implement circuit breakers *at the application level*.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion DoS (Worker-Focused)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_dos__worker-focused_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious jobs designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the Sidekiq *worker machines*. This can lead to worker crashes, unresponsiveness, and denial of service, directly impacting Sidekiq's processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, similar to job flooding, but focused on exploiting resource limitations of the worker machines running Sidekiq.
*   **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Worker processes (execution of job code – specifically, the resource consumption of the code executed by Sidekiq workers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU quotas) on worker processes *using operating system tools or containerization*.
    *   Use job timeouts *within the Sidekiq job code* to prevent long-running or runaway jobs.
    *   Monitor worker resource usage and set up alerts for anomalies.
    *   Implement robust error handling *within the Sidekiq job code* to prevent jobs from crashing workers.
    *   Consider sandboxing worker processes (e.g., using Docker containers with limited capabilities).
    *   Validate job parameters *before enqueuing* to prevent excessively large or complex inputs.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_job_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with access to Redis or the Sidekiq Web UI modifies, deletes, or re-enqueues existing jobs, potentially altering application behavior or causing data corruption. This is a direct manipulation of Sidekiq's data.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, denial of service (by deleting jobs), potential for privilege escalation.
* **Affected Sidekiq Component:** Redis data storage, Sidekiq Web UI.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Redis:** (See mitigations in "Redis Data Breach" section).
    * **Restrict Web UI Access:** (See mitigations in previous responses, including strong authentication and authorization).
    * **Implement Auditing:** Log all job-related actions (enqueue, delete, retry, etc.) to track changes and identify unauthorized activity. This auditing should be integrated with Sidekiq's lifecycle events.
