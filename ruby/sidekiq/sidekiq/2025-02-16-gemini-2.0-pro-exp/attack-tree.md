## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Sidekiq Web UI -> 1.1 Unauthorized Access -> 1.1.1 Weak Authentication (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sidekiq_web_ui_-_1_1_unauthorized_access_-_1_1_1_weak_authentication__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Sidekiq Web UI by exploiting weak or default authentication credentials. This is a common attack vector if the Web UI is exposed to the internet or an internal network without proper security measures.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  The attacker identifies the Sidekiq Web UI endpoint (often `/sidekiq`).
    2.  The attacker attempts to log in using default credentials (e.g., `admin/password`, `sidekiq/sidekiq`).
    3.  If default credentials fail, the attacker may attempt a brute-force or dictionary attack using common or weak passwords.
    4.  If successful, the attacker gains full access to the Web UI.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Very High. The attacker can view, modify, and delete jobs and queues. They can pause or resume processing, potentially leading to denial of service or data loss.  They can also use the Web UI to potentially inject malicious jobs (if the application is vulnerable).
*   **Likelihood:**
    *   Medium to High (depending on exposure and configuration). If the Web UI is exposed and uses default credentials, the likelihood is very high.
*   **Effort:**
    *   Very Low to Low. Trying default credentials is trivial. Brute-forcing weak passwords requires slightly more effort.
*   **Skill Level:**
    *   Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:**
    *   Medium. Failed login attempts might be logged, but slow brute-forcing could go unnoticed without proper monitoring.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Require authentication for the Sidekiq Web UI.
    *   Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Regularly audit authentication mechanisms.
    *   Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) to handle authentication.
    *   Disable the Web UI if it's not absolutely necessary.
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Jobs and Queues -> 2.1 Inject Malicious Job [CRITICAL] -> 2.1.1 Craft Malicious Job (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_jobs_and_queues_-_2_1_inject_malicious_job__critical__-_2_1_1_craft_malicious_job__hig_f2492b90.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious job payload that, when executed by a Sidekiq worker, achieves Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker node or application server. This is the most critical threat.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  The attacker gains the ability to submit jobs to Sidekiq (this could be through the Web UI, a compromised application component, or direct access to Redis).
    2.  The attacker analyzes the application's worker code to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited through job arguments (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection, SQL injection, path traversal).
    3.  The attacker crafts a job payload that exploits the identified vulnerability. This payload might contain shell commands, malicious code, or data designed to trigger unintended behavior.
    4.  The attacker submits the malicious job to Sidekiq.
    5.  A Sidekiq worker picks up the job and executes it.
    6.  The malicious payload is executed, granting the attacker RCE.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Very High. RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, data destruction, or further lateral movement within the network.
*   **Likelihood:**
    *   Low to Medium (depends heavily on vulnerabilities in the application's worker code). This is the most technically challenging attack, but also the most impactful.
*   **Effort:**
    *   Medium to High. Requires understanding the application's job processing logic and crafting a suitable exploit payload.
*   **Skill Level:**
    *   Advanced to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:**
    *   Hard to Very Hard. Requires sophisticated intrusion detection systems, code analysis, and potentially sandboxing of worker processes.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Treat all job arguments as untrusted input.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization within your worker code. *Never* trust data coming from the queue.
    *   Use a secure coding framework and follow secure coding practices.
    *   Consider sandboxing worker processes to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   Use a principle of least privilege â€“ workers should only have the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly perform security code reviews and penetration testing.
    *   Avoid `eval` or similar dynamic code execution based on job arguments.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help detect and block malicious payloads.
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect unusual activity within worker processes.
