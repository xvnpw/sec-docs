# Attack Surface Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Attack Surface: [Redis Exposure and Access Control](./attack_surfaces/redis_exposure_and_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Sidekiq.
*   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Sidekiq *requires* Redis for its operation.  The security of Sidekiq is fundamentally linked to the security of the Redis instance.  Sidekiq's configuration directly determines how it connects to Redis.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for open Redis ports (default 6379) and finds a Sidekiq-connected Redis instance without a password.  They connect and use `RPUSH` to inject a malicious job, or `DEL` to delete all existing jobs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over Sidekiq queues.
    *   Malicious job execution (RCE).
    *   Data theft (job arguments stored in Redis).
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Strong Authentication:** Configure Redis with a strong, unique password.  Use the `redis://:password@host:port/db` URL format in Sidekiq's configuration.  *Never* use a default or easily guessable password.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Redis on a private network, accessible *only* to Sidekiq workers and the application servers that enqueue jobs.  Use firewalls and network ACLs.  *Never* expose Redis to the public internet.
    *   **Use TLS:** Encrypt the connection between Sidekiq and Redis using TLS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Redis ACLs (Redis 6+):**  Create a dedicated Redis user for Sidekiq with *only* the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `RPUSH`, `LPOP`, `BRPOP`, `ZADD`, `ZRANGEBYSCORE`, `ZREM`). Avoid granting administrative privileges or access to keys outside of Sidekiq's namespace.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Job Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_job_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**  Deserialization of untrusted data passed as job arguments, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Sidekiq *itself* performs the serialization and deserialization of job arguments to pass them between the enqueuing process and the worker processes. The choice of serialization format is a configuration option within Sidekiq, and the handling of this data is central to Sidekiq's operation.
*   **Example:**  A web application allows users to provide input that is directly passed as a job argument.  The application uses `Marshal.load` (or another unsafe deserialization method) within a Sidekiq worker to process this input.  An attacker crafts a malicious input string containing a serialized object that exploits a vulnerability in the application's code or a dependency.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Sidekiq worker servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the serialization format and application context)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Marshal with Untrusted Data:**  *Never* use `Marshal.load` with data from untrusted sources.  Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON for data received from untrusted sources. JSON is generally safe for deserialization unless the application explicitly uses the deserialized data in an unsafe way (e.g., `eval`).
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data passed as job arguments, *before* it is serialized and enqueued.  Define a strict schema for expected data types and values.  Reject any input that does not conform to the schema.  This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries (If Necessary):** If complex object serialization is absolutely unavoidable, *carefully* research and use a library specifically designed for safe deserialization of untrusted data, *if* one exists for your chosen format.  This is a complex and often error-prone area; proceed with extreme caution and expert consultation.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Sidekiq Web UI](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_sidekiq_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of the Sidekiq Web UI without authentication, allowing unauthorized access to job information and control.
*   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** The Web UI is a *built-in* feature of Sidekiq.  Its presence and accessibility are directly controlled by Sidekiq's configuration and deployment.
*   **Example:**  An attacker discovers the Sidekiq Web UI at `/sidekiq` on a production server.  They can view the details of running jobs, retry failed jobs, and potentially delete jobs, disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (job details, queue sizes, potentially sensitive data displayed in the UI).
    *   Job manipulation (retry, delete, potentially enqueue new jobs if the UI allows it).
    *   Potential DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Authentication:**  *Always* protect the Sidekiq Web UI with authentication.  Use HTTP Basic Auth, a reverse proxy with authentication (e.g., Nginx, Apache), or integrate with the application's existing authentication system (recommended).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the Web UI to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules or network ACLs.  Ideally, the Web UI should only be accessible from within the application's internal network.
