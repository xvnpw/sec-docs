# Attack Surface Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or poorly secured Redis instance allows unauthorized access.](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_poorly_secured_redis_instance_allows_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Unprotected or poorly secured Redis instance allows unauthorized access.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Sidekiq relies on Redis as its message broker. If Redis is compromised, so is Sidekiq's integrity and the application's background job processing.
    *   **Example:**  A Redis instance used by Sidekiq is exposed to the public internet without a password. An attacker connects and reads all job data, including sensitive information, injects malicious jobs, or deletes queues.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, manipulation of background jobs leading to application malfunction, denial of service, potential for remote code execution on the Redis server itself.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Require authentication (using the `requirepass` directive in `redis.conf`).
        *   Bind Redis to localhost or specific internal network interfaces.
        *   Use a firewall to restrict access to the Redis port (default 6379).
        *   Regularly update Redis to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using TLS encryption for communication between Sidekiq and Redis.

## Attack Surface: [Code injection via malicious job arguments.](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_malicious_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Code injection via malicious job arguments.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Workers execute code based on the arguments provided in the job. If these arguments are not properly sanitized and the worker directly executes or interprets them, it can lead to code injection.
    *   **Example:** A worker uses `eval` or a similar dynamic execution method on a job argument. An attacker crafts a job with a malicious argument like `system('rm -rf /')`. When the worker processes this job, it executes the command, potentially destroying the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the worker server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use `eval` or similar dynamic execution methods on data from job arguments.**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from job arguments.
        *   Use type checking and ensure arguments conform to expected data structures.
        *   Employ secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Redis command injection via unsanitized job arguments.](./attack_surfaces/redis_command_injection_via_unsanitized_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Redis command injection via unsanitized job arguments.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** If worker code directly uses job arguments in Redis commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious Redis commands that Sidekiq will execute against its own data store.
    *   **Example:** A worker takes a user-provided key as an argument and uses it in a `redis.get(key)` command. An attacker provides a key like `"*"; FLUSHALL; GET "legitimate_key"` which could execute `FLUSHALL`, deleting all Redis data used by Sidekiq.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss affecting Sidekiq's operation, denial of service for background job processing, potential for further system compromise if Redis is not properly isolated.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user-provided data in Redis commands within worker code.
        *   Use Redis client libraries that offer parameterized commands or safe ways to construct queries.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from job arguments before using it in Redis operations.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization vulnerabilities in job arguments.](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization vulnerabilities in job arguments.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Sidekiq serializes job arguments (often using Ruby's `Marshal` by default). If not handled carefully, deserializing untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution within the worker process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized by a Sidekiq worker, exploits a known vulnerability in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code on the worker server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the worker server.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using default insecure serialization methods like `Marshal` for untrusted data.**
        *   If `Marshal` is necessary, use `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` or similar mechanisms to sign and verify the integrity of serialized data.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON for job arguments.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized access to the Sidekiq Web UI.](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_the_sidekiq_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Sidekiq Web UI.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Sidekiq provides a web interface for monitoring and managing jobs. If not properly secured, unauthorized users can access sensitive information about background job processing and potentially manipulate jobs.
    *   **Example:** The Sidekiq Web UI is deployed without authentication or with weak default credentials, allowing anyone to view job queues, retry failed jobs (potentially triggering unintended actions), and glean information about application processes.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure about application workflows and potentially sensitive data within job details, manipulation of background job processing, potential for denial of service by deleting or retrying jobs excessively.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always implement strong authentication and authorization for the Sidekiq Web UI.** Use Rack middleware like `Rack::Auth::Basic` or integrate with your application's authentication system.
        *   Restrict access to the Web UI to authorized personnel only.
        *   Deploy the Web UI on a separate, protected subdomain or path.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of sensitive data in job payloads.](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_job_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive data in job payloads.
    *   **How Sidekiq Contributes:** Job arguments, which may contain sensitive data, are stored in Redis and potentially in logs associated with Sidekiq's operation.
    *   **Example:** A job processes user credentials or API keys and includes them as plain text arguments. If the Redis instance used by Sidekiq is compromised, or if Sidekiq's logs are accessed, this sensitive data is exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, compromise of user accounts or external services.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in job arguments.**
        *   If sensitive data is necessary, encrypt it before enqueuing the job and decrypt it within the worker.
        *   Redact sensitive information from Sidekiq's job logs.
        *   Implement access controls on the Redis instance used by Sidekiq and Sidekiq's log files.
