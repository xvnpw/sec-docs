## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Compromise Application via Sidekiq ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_compromise_application_via_sidekiq__critical_node_.md)

This is the overarching goal, representing the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities related to Sidekiq.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Unsafe Job Deserialization ***[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_unsafe_job_deserialization__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Sidekiq relies on serialization (often using `Marshal` in Ruby) to store job data in Redis. If the application doesn't carefully control what data is being deserialized, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the worker, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Inject Malicious Serialized Payload into Enqueued Job ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_inject_malicious_serialized_payload_into_enqueued_job__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers might target API endpoints or other parts of the application responsible for enqueuing jobs. By exploiting vulnerabilities in these processes, they can inject their own malicious serialized data into the job payload.
    * If job data originates from a database or other external source, compromising that source allows attackers to insert malicious serialized data that will be enqueued.
    * Ruby's `Marshal` format has known "gadgets" â€“ classes with specific methods that can be chained together during deserialization to execute arbitrary code. Attackers can craft payloads leveraging these gadgets.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Inject Malicious Code or Commands via Job Arguments ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_inject_malicious_code_or_commands_via_job_arguments__high-risk_path_.md)

Even without exploiting deserialization, attackers can manipulate job arguments to cause harm if the worker logic isn't robust.
    * If the worker code directly uses job arguments in system calls or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    * If the worker code constructs shell commands using job arguments, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Redis Vulnerabilities Related to Sidekiq ***[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_redis_vulnerabilities_related_to_sidekiq__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Sidekiq relies heavily on Redis. Compromising the Redis instance can directly impact the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Gain Unauthorized Access to Redis Instance ***[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_gain_unauthorized_access_to_redis_instance__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

If Redis is configured with default credentials or weak passwords, attackers can easily gain access.
    * If the Redis port is exposed to the internet or untrusted networks without proper firewall rules, it's vulnerable to attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Manipulate Redis Data Structures Used by Sidekiq ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_manipulate_redis_data_structures_used_by_sidekiq__high-risk_path_.md)

With access to Redis, attackers can craft and inject their own malicious job payloads directly into the Sidekiq queues, bypassing the normal enqueueing process.
    * Attackers can modify existing job data in Redis to alter the behavior of worker processes.
    * Deleting jobs or entire queues can disrupt application functionality.
