# Threat Model Analysis for sidekiq/sidekiq

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Redis](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_redis.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance used *by Sidekiq*. This could be through exploiting weak or missing authentication on Redis, or by accessing Redis from an exposed network. Once inside, the attacker can directly interact with *Sidekiq's* data store.

**Impact:** The attacker can delete or modify existing *Sidekiq* jobs, inject malicious jobs to be executed by *Sidekiq* workers, or read sensitive data stored within *Sidekiq* job arguments, leading to data loss, remote code execution, or information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Redis Data Breach through Job Inspection](./threats/redis_data_breach_through_job_inspection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the Redis instance inspects the stored job data *used by Sidekiq*. *Sidekiq* job arguments are often serialized and stored in Redis, potentially containing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, personally identifiable information (PII), API keys, or other sensitive information that was intended to be processed in the background *by Sidekiq*.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Redis Denial of Service (DoS) via Job Flooding](./threats/redis_denial_of_service__dos__via_job_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Redis instance with a large number of malicious or unnecessary jobs, specifically targeting the queues *used by Sidekiq*. This can overwhelm Redis, consuming excessive resources and preventing legitimate *Sidekiq* jobs from being processed.

**Impact:** Disruption of background job processing *managed by Sidekiq*, application slowdown, potential application downtime due to dependent processes waiting for *Sidekiq* job completion.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious Job Execution Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_job_execution_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects a specially crafted job with malicious arguments *into Sidekiq*. When a *Sidekiq* worker processes this job, the malicious arguments are interpreted in a way that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the worker machine. This could exploit vulnerabilities in the worker code or its dependencies *when processing a Sidekiq job*.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the worker machine processing *Sidekiq* jobs, potentially leading to data breaches, further attacks on the internal network, or service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion by Malicious Jobs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_by_malicious_jobs.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects jobs *into Sidekiq* designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the worker machines during processing *by Sidekiq*.

**Impact:** Worker process crashes, application slowdown, potential denial of service on worker nodes, impacting the processing of legitimate *Sidekiq* jobs.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Processing](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_processing.md)

**Description:** *Sidekiq* uses a serialization mechanism (often JSON or MessagePack) to store job arguments. If there are vulnerabilities in the deserialization process *within Sidekiq workers*, an attacker could craft malicious job arguments that, when deserialized by a worker, lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on worker machines processing *Sidekiq* jobs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Job Tampering in Redis](./threats/job_tampering_in_redis.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to Redis modifies existing jobs in the queues *used by Sidekiq*, altering their arguments or execution parameters.

**Impact:** Execution of *Sidekiq* jobs with incorrect or malicious data, potentially leading to unintended application behavior, data corruption, or security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass in Sidekiq Web UI](./threats/authentication_bypass_in_sidekiq_web_ui.md)

**Description:** If the *Sidekiq* Web UI is enabled and not properly secured with authentication, attackers can gain unauthorized access to view job queues, statistics, and potentially perform administrative actions *within Sidekiq*.

**Impact:** Information disclosure about background job processing *managed by Sidekiq*, potential manipulation of jobs (if administrative actions are exposed without authentication).

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Details](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_details.md)

**Description:** Sensitive *Sidekiq* configuration details, such as Redis connection strings or authentication credentials, are inadvertently exposed.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Redis instance *used by Sidekiq*, potentially leading to all the threats associated with unauthorized Redis access affecting *Sidekiq*.

**Risk Severity:** High
