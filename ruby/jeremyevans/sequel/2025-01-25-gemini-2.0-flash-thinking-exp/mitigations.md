# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jeremyevans/sequel

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Use Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/1__use_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input Points:** Locate all places in your application code where user-provided data is incorporated into SQL queries *using Sequel*.
    2.  **Replace String Interpolation with Placeholders:**  Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL strings using string interpolation (e.g., `"#{}"`, `"%{}"`) within Sequel queries, switch to Sequel's placeholder syntax (`?` for positional, `:name` for named).
    3.  **Pass User Input as Arguments to Sequel Methods:**  Provide user input values as separate arguments to Sequel's query methods like `where`, `filter`, `insert`, `update`, etc. Sequel will handle proper escaping and parameterization before sending the query to the database.
    4.  **Review Existing Sequel Queries:**  Systematically review all existing database queries constructed using Sequel in your codebase and refactor them to use parameterized queries.
    5.  **Code Reviews and Training (Sequel Focus):**  Educate developers specifically on using Sequel's parameterized query features and incorporate code reviews to ensure consistent and correct usage within Sequel queries.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code by ensuring Sequel treats user input as data, not code, when constructing queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction - Parameterized queries, as implemented by Sequel, are the most effective defense against common SQL injection vulnerabilities within Sequel-managed queries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Parameterized queries are used in most new feature development and core data access layers that utilize Sequel.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Legacy modules and some older API endpoints still use string interpolation for dynamic query construction in a few places *within Sequel queries*. Need to refactor these sections to leverage Sequel's parameterization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Utilize Sequel's Built-in Escaping Mechanisms (When Necessary)](./mitigation_strategies/2__utilize_sequel's_built-in_escaping_mechanisms__when_necessary_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Sequel's Escaping for Identifiers and String Literals
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic SQL Construction in Sequel:** Pinpoint areas where you are dynamically building SQL queries *using Sequel*, especially when dealing with user-provided table names, column names, or values that must be treated as identifiers or string literals within Sequel.
    2.  **Use `Sequel.SQL::Identifier` for Identifiers in Sequel:** When incorporating user-provided table or column names within Sequel queries, wrap them with `Sequel.SQL::Identifier.new()`. This ensures Sequel properly quotes and escapes them as SQL identifiers, preventing identifier-based injection within Sequel-generated SQL.
    3.  **Use `Sequel.SQL::StringLiteral` for String Literals (If Needed in Sequel):** In rare cases where you need to dynamically construct string literals within Sequel queries and cannot use parameterized queries, use `Sequel.SQL::StringLiteral.new()`. This ensures Sequel escapes special characters within the string literal. However, parameterized queries are generally preferred even for string literals within Sequel.
    4.  **Limit Dynamic SQL Construction in Sequel:**  Minimize the need for dynamic SQL construction *within Sequel* as much as possible. Refactor code to use Sequel's query builder and parameterized queries whenever feasible, even for scenarios that might seem to require dynamic SQL.
    5.  **Code Review for Dynamic Sequel:**  Thoroughly review any code sections that involve dynamic SQL construction *using Sequel* to ensure proper escaping is applied using Sequel's mechanisms and to look for opportunities to simplify or eliminate dynamic SQL within Sequel queries.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Medium Severity) - Mitigates SQL injection risks in scenarios where dynamic SQL is unavoidable *within Sequel*, specifically identifier and string literal injection. Less effective than parameterized queries for general data injection within Sequel.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Medium Reduction - Reduces risk in specific dynamic SQL scenarios *within Sequel*, but less comprehensive than parameterized queries for general data handling in Sequel.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Not consistently implemented. Developers are aware of these Sequel methods, but usage is not enforced in all dynamic SQL scenarios *within Sequel queries*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement code analysis tools or linters to detect dynamic SQL construction *within Sequel queries* and enforce the use of `Sequel.SQL::Identifier` and `Sequel.SQL::StringLiteral` where necessary.  Also, need to provide better developer training specifically on these Sequel techniques.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Review and Audit Raw SQL Queries (Used with Sequel)](./mitigation_strategies/3__review_and_audit_raw_sql_queries__used_with_sequel_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Raw SQL Query Auditing (in Sequel Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Raw SQL Usage in Sequel:** Search the codebase for instances of `Sequel.DB[]` or `Sequel.DB.run` which indicate the use of raw SQL queries *executed through Sequel*.
    2.  **Manual Code Review of Sequel Raw SQL:** Conduct a manual code review of each raw SQL query executed via Sequel.
    3.  **Parameterization or Escaping Check in Sequel Raw SQL:** For each raw SQL query executed through Sequel, verify if user inputs are being handled using parameterized queries (placeholders) or proper escaping mechanisms (like `Sequel.SQL::Identifier`, `Sequel.SQL::StringLiteral` *as used within the raw SQL string or by Sequel's escaping functions*).
    4.  **Refactor to Sequel Query Builder (Where Possible):**  Where possible, refactor raw SQL queries *executed through Sequel* to use Sequel's query builder methods. This improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of manual escaping errors when using Sequel.
    5.  **Automated Static Analysis (Optional for Sequel Raw SQL):** Explore static analysis tools that can help identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in raw SQL queries *executed via Sequel*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Directly addresses SQL injection risks in raw SQL queries *executed through Sequel*, which are often more vulnerable due to manual construction even when used with Sequel.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction -  Critical for securing raw SQL queries *used with Sequel*, which are a common source of SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled carefully even when integrated with Sequel.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Ad-hoc code reviews are performed, but no systematic or regular auditing process is in place specifically for raw SQL queries *executed through Sequel*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a regular schedule for auditing raw SQL queries *used with Sequel*. Integrate this audit into the code review process and potentially use static analysis tools to automate vulnerability detection in raw SQL executed via Sequel.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Use `set_fields` or `set` with Whitelists for Sequel Model Updates/Inserts](./mitigation_strategies/4__use__set_fields__or__set__with_whitelists_for_sequel_model_updatesinserts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Whitelisted Mass Assignment in Sequel Models
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sequel Model Update/Insert Points:** Locate all places in the application where Sequel models are used to update or insert data, particularly when handling user-submitted data (e.g., form submissions, API requests) *through Sequel models*.
    2.  **Replace Direct `update`/`insert` with `set_fields` or `set` in Sequel Models:** Instead of directly using `model.update(params)` or `model.insert(params)` with unfiltered user input in Sequel models, switch to using `model.set_fields(params, :allowed_fields)` or `model.set(params).save` *within Sequel model operations*.
    3.  **Define Allowed Fields Whitelists for Sequel Models:** For each Sequel model and update/insert operation, explicitly define a whitelist of allowed attributes that can be modified or set via mass assignment *using Sequel's `set_fields` or `set` methods*.
    4.  **Code Review for Whitelisting in Sequel Models:**  Ensure that all Sequel model update and insert operations that handle user input are using whitelisting and that the whitelists are correctly defined and reviewed *in the context of Sequel model usage*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from modifying unintended Sequel model attributes by controlling input parameters, potentially leading to data breaches or privilege escalation *when using Sequel models*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment: High Reduction - Whitelisting, as implemented through Sequel's `set_fields` or `set` methods, is a highly effective way to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities in Sequel models.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Whitelisting is used in some newer Sequel models and controllers, but not consistently across the entire application *when interacting with Sequel models*. Some older parts still use direct `update` or `insert` with request parameters on Sequel models.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to systematically review all Sequel model update and insert operations and implement whitelisting consistently using Sequel's features.  Develop coding standards and code review checklists to enforce whitelisting for mass assignment in Sequel models.
