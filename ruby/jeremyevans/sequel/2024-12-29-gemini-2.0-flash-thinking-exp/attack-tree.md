Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application via Sequel Exploitation**
    * This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the application's data or functionality by exploiting weaknesses related to the Sequel library.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Sequel**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are processed by Sequel to construct database queries. If not properly sanitized or parameterized, this injected SQL can be executed by the database, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    * **Enabling Steps:**
        * **Identify Input Points Accessible to Attacker:** Attackers identify web forms, API endpoints, or other sources where they can provide input that is used in Sequel queries.
        * **Craft Malicious SQL Payload:** Attackers create SQL code designed to exploit the lack of proper input handling. Examples include using `OR 1=1` to bypass authentication or `UNION SELECT` to extract data from other tables.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Unsafe String Interpolation in Raw SQL Queries**
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers directly embed user-provided data into raw SQL query strings using string interpolation (e.g., `Sequel.db["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{params[:username]}'"]`). This makes the application highly vulnerable to SQL injection.
    * **Enabling Step:**
        * **Inject Malicious SQL through String Formatting:** Attackers provide input containing malicious SQL code that, when interpolated into the query string, alters the query's intended logic. For example, inputting `' OR 1=1 --` would modify the query to return all users.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploiting `Sequel.lit` or Similar Raw SQL Methods**
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers use Sequel's methods like `Sequel.lit` to execute raw SQL. If user input is passed directly to these methods without sanitization, it creates an SQL injection vulnerability.
    * **Enabling Step:**
        * **Inject Malicious SQL through `Sequel.lit` calls:** Attackers provide malicious SQL code as input that is then directly executed by the database through the `Sequel.lit` call.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Configuration Issues Related to Sequel**
    * This path encompasses vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration related to Sequel and database access.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Database Credentials Stored or Accessed by Sequel**
    * **Attack Vector:** Database credentials (username, password) used by Sequel are stored insecurely. This could be in plain text in configuration files, hardcoded in the application, or stored in easily accessible locations.
    * **Enabling Step:**
        * **Obtain database credentials used by Sequel to directly access the database:** If an attacker gains access to these credentials, they can bypass the application entirely and directly interact with the database, potentially causing significant damage.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Insufficient Database Permissions Granted to Sequel's User**
    * **Attack Vector:** The database user that Sequel uses to connect to the database has excessive permissions. Even without SQL injection, an attacker who can execute queries through the application (or directly if they gain access) can perform unauthorized actions if the user has overly broad permissions.
    * **Enabling Step:**
        * **Leverage allowed permissions to perform unauthorized actions:**  An attacker could use allowed permissions (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, access to sensitive data) to compromise the database or application.
