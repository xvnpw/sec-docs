## Deep Analysis: Pass unsanitized user input directly into raw SQL queries (High-Risk Path)

This analysis delves into the "Pass unsanitized user input directly into raw SQL queries" attack tree path within the context of an application utilizing the Sequel Ruby ORM. This is a critical vulnerability, representing a direct route to SQL Injection, one of the OWASP Top Ten security risks.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the misuse of Sequel's flexibility, specifically its ability to execute raw SQL queries. While powerful for complex or highly optimized queries, this feature introduces significant risk when combined with unsanitized user input. Sequel, by design, trusts the developer to handle sanitization when using raw SQL methods. When this trust is misplaced and user-provided data is directly embedded into raw SQL strings, the application becomes susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

* **Entry Point:** The primary entry points for this attack are Sequel methods that allow the execution of raw SQL. The example highlights `Sequel.lit`, but other methods like `Sequel.expr` with string interpolation, or even directly using the database connection's `run` method, can be exploited similarly.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker manipulates user-controllable input fields (e.g., form submissions, URL parameters, API requests) to inject malicious SQL code. This malicious code is then incorporated into the raw SQL query executed by the application.
* **Sequel's Role:** While Sequel provides excellent protection against SQL injection through its DSL and parameterized queries, these safeguards are bypassed when developers explicitly choose to use raw SQL and fail to sanitize the input. Sequel's inherent security features are not active in this scenario.
* **Developer Error:** This vulnerability is primarily a result of developer error or a lack of understanding of SQL injection risks. It highlights a failure to adhere to secure coding practices.

**Detailed Example Analysis:**

Let's break down the provided example: `dataset.where(Sequel.lit("user_id = #{params[:id]}""))`

1. **User Input:**  The attacker crafts a malicious value for `params[:id]`. Instead of a simple integer like `1`, they provide a string like `1 OR 1=1`.
2. **String Interpolation:** Ruby's string interpolation (`#{}`) directly substitutes the attacker's input into the SQL string.
3. **Raw SQL Construction:** The resulting raw SQL query becomes: `WHERE user_id = 1 OR 1=1`.
4. **SQL Injection:** The `OR 1=1` clause is a classic SQL injection technique. `1=1` is always true, effectively making the `WHERE` clause always true. This bypasses the intended filtering logic based on `user_id`.
5. **Consequences:**  The query now returns all user records instead of just the one with the specified ID. This allows the attacker to potentially view sensitive data of other users.

**Expanding on Impact:**

The impact of this vulnerability extends far beyond simply bypassing an ID check. Depending on the context and database permissions, an attacker could:

* **Data Breach:** Access, exfiltrate, or modify sensitive data belonging to other users or the application itself.
* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Modify or delete critical data, leading to inconsistencies and potential application malfunction.
* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**  Gain unauthorized access to privileged functionalities or administrative accounts.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, making the application unavailable.
* **Remote Code Execution (Less Common with Sequel's Defaults):** In some database configurations or with specific Sequel extensions, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the database server.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the database server is connected to other systems, the attacker might be able to use the compromised database as a stepping stone to access other parts of the infrastructure.

**Likelihood Assessment - Deeper Dive:**

While categorized as "Medium," the likelihood can fluctuate significantly based on several factors:

* **Frequency of Raw SQL Usage:** Applications heavily reliant on raw SQL for performance or complex queries are at higher risk.
* **Developer Awareness and Training:** Teams with strong security awareness and training are less likely to make this mistake.
* **Code Review Practices:**  Thorough code reviews can identify and prevent the introduction of such vulnerabilities.
* **Security Testing:**  The presence and effectiveness of static analysis security testing (SAST) and dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) tools can help detect these flaws.
* **Legacy Code:** Older applications or modules might contain instances of raw SQL usage with inadequate sanitization.
* **Complexity of Queries:** Developers might resort to raw SQL for complex queries, increasing the chance of overlooking sanitization needs.

**Mitigation Strategies - A Comprehensive Approach:**

The primary goal is to eliminate the possibility of injecting malicious SQL code. Here's a detailed breakdown of mitigation strategies:

1. **Avoid Raw SQL with User Input:** This is the **strongest and recommended mitigation**. Leverage Sequel's powerful DSL (Domain Specific Language) and parameterized queries whenever possible. Sequel's DSL automatically handles proper escaping and quoting, preventing SQL injection.

   * **Example using Sequel DSL:**
     Instead of: `dataset.where(Sequel.lit("user_id = #{params[:id]}""))`
     Use: `dataset.where(user_id: params[:id])` or `dataset.where(user_id: Integer(params[:id]))` (for type safety).

2. **Strict Input Validation:** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary (and this should be a rare exception), implement rigorous input validation **before** incorporating the data into the query.

   * **Whitelisting:** Define an allowed set of characters, patterns, or values. Reject any input that doesn't conform. For example, if expecting an integer ID, validate that the input consists only of digits.
   * **Type Checking:** Ensure the input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
   * **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific formats and patterns.

3. **Escaping and Quoting (Use with Extreme Caution):** If raw SQL is unavoidable, use Sequel's escaping mechanisms. However, this is error-prone and should be considered a last resort.

   * **`Sequel.value(input)`:** This method escapes the input according to the database's rules.
   * **Database-Specific Escaping:**  Sequel provides access to the underlying database connection, which often has its own escaping functions.

   **Important Note:** Relying solely on escaping can still be vulnerable if the escaping is not implemented correctly or if the context of the injection allows for bypasses.

4. **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):** While Sequel's DSL handles this automatically, if you are directly interacting with the database connection, use prepared statements. Prepared statements separate the SQL structure from the data, preventing the interpretation of user input as SQL code.

5. **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL.

6. **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where raw SQL is used. Look for instances where user input is directly incorporated without proper sanitization.

7. **Static and Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. However, WAFs should be considered a defense-in-depth measure and not a replacement for secure coding practices.

9. **Developer Training and Education:** Educate developers about SQL injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices, specifically emphasizing the risks associated with raw SQL and the benefits of using Sequel's DSL.

**Conclusion:**

The "Pass unsanitized user input directly into raw SQL queries" attack path represents a significant security risk in applications using Sequel. While Sequel provides robust protection through its DSL, the decision to use raw SQL with unsanitized user input directly bypasses these safeguards. Mitigation requires a strong commitment to secure coding practices, prioritizing the use of Sequel's DSL and implementing rigorous input validation when raw SQL is absolutely necessary. A layered security approach, including code reviews, security testing, and developer training, is crucial to prevent and detect this critical vulnerability. Treating all user input as potentially malicious is a fundamental principle in building secure applications.
