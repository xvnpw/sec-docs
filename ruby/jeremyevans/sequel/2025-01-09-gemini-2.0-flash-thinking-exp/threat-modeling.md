# Threat Model Analysis for jeremyevans/sequel

## Threat: [Raw SQL Injection](./threats/raw_sql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating user-provided input that is directly embedded into raw SQL queries executed using methods like `db.execute` or `db[]` without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential execution of operating system commands on the database server if database permissions allow.

**Sequel Component Affected:** `Sequel::Database#execute`, `Sequel::Database#[]` (when used with string interpolation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries** with placeholders for user-provided data when using the query builder or raw SQL execution.
* **Avoid string interpolation** directly into raw SQL strings.
* If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, **meticulously sanitize and validate** all user inputs using Sequel's escaping mechanisms (e.g., `Sequel.lit` with caution).

## Threat: [SQL Injection via String Interpolation in Query Builder](./threats/sql_injection_via_string_interpolation_in_query_builder.md)

**Description:** Even when using Sequel's query builder, developers might incorrectly use string interpolation to insert user-provided data into methods like `where` or `having`. This bypasses the built-in parameterization and allows for SQL injection.

**Impact:** Similar to raw SQL injection - unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, potential command execution on the database server.

**Sequel Component Affected:**  Methods within `Sequel::Dataset` that accept conditions (e.g., `where`, `having`) when used with string interpolation instead of hash conditions or parameterized expressions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use hash conditions or parameterized expressions** when providing dynamic values to query builder methods like `where`, `having`, `order`, etc.
* **Avoid string interpolation** within query builder methods for user-provided data.
* **Use Sequel's literal string escaping** (`Sequel.lit`) with extreme caution and only when absolutely necessary for complex, non-user-provided SQL fragments.

## Threat: [Insecure Database Connection Configuration](./threats/insecure_database_connection_configuration.md)

**Description:** Sequel relies on the underlying database adapter for connection management. If the database connection configuration (e.g., credentials stored in plain text in code, insecure connection protocols) is not handled securely, it can lead to unauthorized access to the database.

**Impact:** Compromise of the database and all its data, potentially allowing attackers to perform any action on the database.

**Sequel Component Affected:**  `Sequel.connect`, adapter-specific connection logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Store database credentials securely** using environment variables, configuration files with restricted permissions, or dedicated secret management tools.
* **Avoid hardcoding credentials** directly in the application code.
* **Use secure connection protocols** (e.g., TLS/SSL) for database connections.
* **Restrict database user permissions** based on the principle of least privilege.
