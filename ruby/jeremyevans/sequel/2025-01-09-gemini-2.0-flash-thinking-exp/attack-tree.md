## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Data (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_application_data__root_goal_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Sequel (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_via_sequel__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the overarching goal of leveraging SQL injection vulnerabilities within the application's use of the Sequel library. Success at this node means the attacker has bypassed intended security measures and can interact with the database in an unauthorized manner. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or even complete compromise of the application's data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized User Input in `where`, `order`, `limit`, etc. clauses (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_user_input_in__where____order____limit___etc__clauses__critical_node_.md)

This node highlights the fundamental weakness of failing to properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided input before incorporating it into Sequel's query building methods. This is a common coding error and a primary entry point for SQL injection attacks. Attackers can manipulate the structure and logic of the generated SQL queries by injecting malicious code within these clauses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Input: Inject malicious SQL directly into Sequel's query building methods. (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_input_inject_malicious_sql_directly_into_sequel's_query_building_methods___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when directly inserted into Sequel's query building methods (like `where`, `order`, `limit`, etc.) without proper sanitization or parameterization, alters the intended SQL query.

**Example:** Consider code like `dataset.where("username = '#{params[:username]}'"")`. If `params[:username]` is set to `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL becomes `SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --'`, which will bypass the intended username check and potentially return all rows.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion.

**Likelihood:** High, due to the prevalence of this type of coding error.

**Mitigation:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Validate and sanitize user input rigorously.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pass unsanitized user input directly into raw SQL queries. (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/pass_unsanitized_user_input_directly_into_raw_sql_queries___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses Sequel's `Sequel.lit` method or other means to execute raw SQL queries, and user-provided input is directly embedded into these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization.

**Example:**  Imagine code like `dataset.where(Sequel.lit("user_id = #{params[:id]}""))`. If `params[:id]` is set to `1 OR 1=1`, the resulting raw SQL becomes `WHERE user_id = 1 OR 1=1`, bypassing the intended ID check.

**Impact:**  Similar to direct input SQL injection, this can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation.

**Likelihood:** Medium, depending on the application's reliance on raw SQL queries.

**Mitigation:**  Avoid using `Sequel.lit` or raw SQL methods with user-provided data. If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization, treating all user input as potentially malicious. Consider alternative Sequel DSL methods to achieve the desired query construction.
