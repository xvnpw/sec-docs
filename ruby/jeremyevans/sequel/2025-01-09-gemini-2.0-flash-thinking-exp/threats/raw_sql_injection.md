This document provides a deep analysis of the "Raw SQL Injection" threat identified in our application's threat model, specifically focusing on its implications within the context of the Sequel Ruby library.

**1. Threat Overview:**

Raw SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that arises when user-controlled data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the intended SQL statement, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**2. Detailed Explanation of the Threat in Sequel Context:**

Sequel offers flexibility in how database interactions are handled, including the ability to execute raw SQL queries. While this can be useful for complex or performance-critical operations, it introduces the risk of SQL injection if not handled carefully.

The primary attack vectors within Sequel are:

* **`Sequel::Database#execute(sql_string)`:** This method directly executes the provided SQL string against the database. If `sql_string` is constructed by concatenating user input without proper escaping, it becomes vulnerable.

* **`Sequel::Database#[sql_string]` (String Interpolation):**  When using the bracket notation with a string containing interpolated user input, Sequel will execute the resulting string as a raw SQL query. This is a common pitfall, as developers might intuitively use string interpolation for dynamic query construction.

**How the Attack Works:**

An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into the raw SQL query, alters its intended logic. Common injection techniques include:

* **Adding additional SQL clauses:**  `' OR '1'='1` can be injected to bypass authentication checks.
* **Executing arbitrary SQL commands:**  `; DROP TABLE users;` can be injected to delete sensitive data (if database permissions allow).
* **Data exfiltration:**  `'; SELECT credit_card FROM sensitive_data WHERE username = 'attacker'` can be injected to steal data.

**Example Scenarios:**

Let's illustrate with code examples:

**Vulnerable Code (using `db.execute`):**

```ruby
def find_user_by_username(username)
  db = Sequel.connect(DATABASE_URL)
  sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{username}'"
  db.execute(sql) # Vulnerable!
end

# Attacker input: ' OR '1'='1
find_user_by_username("' OR '1'='1")
```

**Resulting Malicious SQL:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

This query will return all users because the `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true.

**Vulnerable Code (using `db[]` with string interpolation):**

```ruby
def get_user_details(user_id)
  db = Sequel.connect(DATABASE_URL)
  db["SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = #{user_id}"] # Vulnerable!
end

# Attacker input: 1; DROP TABLE user_profiles; --
get_user_details("1; DROP TABLE user_profiles; --")
```

**Resulting Malicious SQL:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = 1; DROP TABLE user_profiles; --
```

This query will first select the user profile with ID 1 and then attempt to drop the entire `user_profiles` table. The `--` comments out any subsequent parts of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

**3. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of a successful Raw SQL Injection attack can be catastrophic:

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (Confidentiality Breach):** Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to access confidential data like user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data.
* **Data Modification or Deletion (Integrity Breach):**  Attackers can modify or delete critical data, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and reputational damage. This can include altering user balances, changing product prices, or completely wiping out databases.
* **Potential Execution of Operating System Commands (Availability and Security Breach):** In some database configurations with elevated privileges, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server. This could allow them to gain full control of the server, install malware, or launch further attacks.
* **Denial of Service (Availability Breach):**  Attackers could execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to service disruptions and downtime.
* **Compliance Violations and Legal Ramifications:** Data breaches resulting from SQL injection can lead to significant fines and penalties under various data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Reputational Damage:**  News of a successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

**4. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this threat being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Frequency of Raw SQL Usage:** The more frequently raw SQL queries are used, the higher the chance of accidental vulnerability introduction.
* **Developer Awareness and Training:**  Lack of awareness and training on secure coding practices, specifically regarding SQL injection prevention, increases the risk.
* **Code Review Practices:**  Insufficient or absent code reviews can allow vulnerable code to slip into production.
* **Security Testing Practices:**  Lack of thorough static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) that specifically targets SQL injection vulnerabilities reduces the chance of detection.
* **Complexity of the Application:**  Larger and more complex applications can have more potential entry points for injection attacks.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization Practices:**  The absence or inadequacy of input validation and sanitization mechanisms is a primary driver of this vulnerability.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Implementation in Sequel):**

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** and recommended mitigation strategy. Sequel provides excellent support for parameterized queries.

   ```ruby
   # Secure example using parameterized queries
   def find_user_by_username(username)
     db = Sequel.connect(DATABASE_URL)
     dataset = db[:users].where(username: username)
     dataset.all
   end

   # OR using raw SQL with parameters:
   def find_user_by_username_raw(username)
     db = Sequel.connect(DATABASE_URL)
     db["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username].all
   end
   ```

   Sequel handles the escaping and quoting of parameters, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as SQL.

* **Avoid String Interpolation in Raw SQL:**  Explicitly avoid using `#{}` for incorporating user input into raw SQL strings.

* **Cautious Use of `Sequel.lit`:**  `Sequel.lit` allows embedding literal SQL fragments. While sometimes necessary for advanced queries, it should be used with extreme caution and only after meticulous sanitization and validation of the input.

   ```ruby
   # Example of using Sequel.lit with caution and input validation
   def search_users_by_column(column_name, search_term)
     db = Sequel.connect(DATABASE_URL)
     # Whitelist allowed column names
     allowed_columns = ['username', 'email', 'full_name']
     raise ArgumentError, "Invalid column name" unless allowed_columns.include?(column_name)

     # Sanitize the search term (example: basic escaping)
     sanitized_search_term = Sequel.escape_string(search_term)

     sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE #{Sequel.lit(column_name)} LIKE '%#{sanitized_search_term}%'"
     db.fetch(sql).all
   end
   ```

   **Note:** Even with `Sequel.lit`, thorough validation and escaping are crucial. Consider using more robust sanitization libraries if needed.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation on the server-side to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected formats and constraints. Sanitize input by escaping special characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks. However, **parameterized queries are still the primary defense.**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they succeed in injecting SQL.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

* **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for suspicious activity that might indicate an ongoing or attempted SQL injection attack.

**6. Prevention During Development:**

* **Secure Coding Training:** Provide regular training to developers on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on SQL injection prevention techniques in the context of Sequel.
* **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews, with a focus on identifying potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan code for potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.
* **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Establish and enforce clear secure coding guidelines that explicitly prohibit the direct embedding of user input into raw SQL queries without proper parameterization or robust sanitization.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:** Review WAF logs for blocked SQL injection attempts.
* **Database Audit Logs:** Enable and monitor database audit logs for suspicious SQL queries, such as queries containing common injection keywords (e.g., `UNION`, `DROP`, `;`).
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS to detect and alert on or block SQL injection attempts.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection systems to identify unusual database activity patterns that might indicate an attack.

**8. Conclusion:**

Raw SQL Injection is a serious threat that can have devastating consequences for our application and organization. By understanding the attack vectors within the Sequel library and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited. **Prioritizing parameterized queries is paramount.**  Continuous vigilance, developer training, and robust security testing are essential to maintain a secure application.

This analysis serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of secure coding practices and the need for ongoing efforts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We must work together to ensure the security and integrity of our application and the data it handles.
