# Attack Surface Analysis for jeremyevans/sequel

## Attack Surface: [Raw SQL Execution Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/raw_sql_execution_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:**  The application directly embeds user-controlled data into raw SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **How Sequel Contributes:** Sequel provides methods like `db.execute_ddl`, `db.run`, and `db[]` that allow developers to execute arbitrary SQL. If these are used with string interpolation of user input, it creates a direct path for SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        username = params[:username]
        db.run("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{username}'")
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Full database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Potential for remote code execution on the database server in some configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:**  Utilize Sequel's built-in parameterization features (e.g., `db[:users].where(username: params[:username])`).
        *   **Avoid string interpolation for user input in SQL:** Never directly embed user-provided data into SQL strings.

## Attack Surface: [Identifier Manipulation Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/identifier_manipulation_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** User-controlled input is used to dynamically construct table or column names in SQL queries without proper validation.
    *   **How Sequel Contributes:** Sequel allows dynamic table and column selection using symbols or strings derived from user input. If not handled carefully, this can lead to attackers accessing or manipulating unintended data.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        table_name = params[:table]
        db[table_name.to_sym].all
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data in different tables or columns. Potential for data modification or deletion in unexpected locations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Whitelist allowed identifiers:**  Maintain a predefined list of valid table and column names and only allow access to those.
        *   **Strict input validation:**  Validate user-provided identifier names against the whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Database Connection String Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_database_connection_string_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Database connection details (credentials, host, port) are exposed or can be manipulated.
    *   **How Sequel Contributes:** Sequel relies on connection strings for database access. If these strings are constructed using user input, attackers can potentially modify them.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        db_user = params[:db_user]
        db_password = params[:db_password]
        Sequel.connect("postgres://#{db_user}:#{db_password}@localhost/mydb")
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, potentially bypassing application authentication. Access to sensitive data and the ability to manipulate it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Securely store connection credentials:** Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application. Use environment variables, configuration files with restricted permissions, or dedicated secrets management systems.
        *   **Avoid constructing connection strings from user input:**  Never directly use user-provided data to build connection strings.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Sequel Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sequel_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party Sequel plugins contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Sequel Contributes:** Sequel's plugin architecture allows developers to extend its functionality. If a plugin has vulnerabilities, it directly impacts the security of the application using it.
    *   **Example:** A plugin that introduces a new method for executing SQL queries without proper input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the plugin's vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully vet and audit plugins:**  Only use plugins from trusted sources and review their code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep plugins up-to-date:**  Regularly update plugins to patch known security flaws.
