### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application via Sequel ORM

**Attack Goal:** Compromise Application via Sequel ORM [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, modifying data, disrupting application functionality, or gaining control over the application's infrastructure. Sequel, as the data access layer, is a critical component that attackers will target to achieve this goal.

To achieve this high-level goal, attackers can explore various attack vectors related to Sequel ORM. We will analyze the most prominent ones:

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries

*   **Description:**  This is a classic and highly critical vulnerability. If developers use raw SQL queries (e.g., `Sequel.db.execute`, `Sequel.db.fetch`) and directly embed unsanitized user input into these queries, they create a direct pathway for SQL Injection attacks.

*   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of input sanitization and parameterization when constructing SQL queries.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**

    1.  **Identify Input Points:** The attacker identifies input fields in the application (e.g., search forms, login fields, URL parameters) that are used in database queries.
    2.  **Inject Malicious SQL:** The attacker crafts malicious input containing SQL code designed to manipulate the query's logic. For example, in a search query:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<user_input>';
        ```

        An attacker might input: `' OR '1'='1` resulting in:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
        ```

        This modified query bypasses the intended username check and returns all users.
    3.  **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:**  Depending on the injection point and the attacker's skill, they can:
        *   **Bypass Authentication:** As shown in the example above.
        *   **Read Sensitive Data:** Extract data from other tables or columns.
        *   **Modify Data:** Update, insert, or delete records.
        *   **Execute Arbitrary SQL Commands:** In some cases, gain control over the database server itself (depending on database permissions and configuration).

*   **Example Code (Vulnerable):**

    ```ruby
    def search_users(username)
      sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{username}'" # Vulnerable - String interpolation
      Sequel::Model.db.fetch(sql).all
    end

    # Usage with user input:
    user_input = params[:username] # User-provided username from request
    users = search_users(user_input)
    ```

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    1.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** **Always use parameterized queries** provided by Sequel for dynamic values in SQL queries. This is the **most effective** defense against SQL Injection. Sequel's query builder and `prepared_statements: true` database connection option facilitate this.

        ```ruby
        def search_users(username)
          Sequel::Model.db[:users].where(username: username).all # Safe - Uses parameterized query
        end

        # Or using raw SQL with parameters:
        def search_users_raw(username)
          Sequel::Model.db.fetch("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username).all # Safe - Parameterized query
        end
        ```

    2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterized queries are primary defense, input validation is still important. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths. Sanitize input by escaping special characters if absolutely necessary (though parameterization is preferred).

    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the necessary permissions. Avoid using database users with overly broad privileges in the application.

    4.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and remediate potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: SQL Injection via Incorrect ORM Usage

*   **Description:** Even when using an ORM like Sequel, developers can still introduce SQL Injection vulnerabilities through incorrect usage patterns. This can occur when developers try to bypass the ORM's safe query building mechanisms or misuse features in a way that leads to unsafe SQL construction.

*   **Vulnerability:**  Misunderstanding or misuse of Sequel's query builder, leading to string concatenation or interpolation of user input within ORM queries where it's not intended or safe.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**

    1.  **Identify ORM Queries with User Input:** The attacker analyzes the application code to find instances where user input is incorporated into Sequel ORM queries.
    2.  **Bypass Parameterization (Accidentally or Intentionally):** Developers might mistakenly use string interpolation within ORM methods that are intended to be safe, or they might try to build complex queries in a way that bypasses parameterization.

        For example, attempting to dynamically build a `where` clause using string concatenation:

        ```ruby
        def search_users_dynamic_column(column_name, search_term)
          # Vulnerable - Incorrectly building dynamic query with string interpolation
          sql_condition = "#{column_name} = '#{search_term}'"
          Sequel::Model.db[:users].where(sql_condition).all # Still vulnerable despite using 'where'
        end

        # Usage with attacker-controlled column_name and search_term:
        column = params[:column_name] # Attacker can control column name
        term = params[:search_term]
        users = search_users_dynamic_column(column, term)
        ```

        If `column_name` is user-controlled, an attacker can inject SQL even within the `where` clause. For example, setting `column_name` to `username OR 1=1 --` would lead to SQL injection.

    3.  **Exploit as in 4.1:** Once SQL injection is achieved, the attacker can exploit it as described in section 4.1 to exfiltrate data, manipulate data, or gain further control.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    1.  **Strictly Adhere to Sequel's Query Builder:**  Rely on Sequel's built-in query builder methods (`where`, `filter`, `order`, etc.) and avoid string interpolation or concatenation when constructing query conditions.

    2.  **Dynamic Column/Table Names with Caution:** If dynamic column or table names are absolutely necessary (which should be rare), use whitelisting or mapping to ensure only allowed names are used and prevent injection of arbitrary SQL.

    3.  **Review Dynamic Query Generation Logic:**  Carefully review any code that dynamically generates query components. Ensure that user input is never directly interpolated into SQL strings, even within ORM methods.

    4.  **Use Sequel's Parameterized Query Features:**  Even when using raw SQL with Sequel, explicitly use parameter placeholders (`?`) and pass parameters separately to ensure proper escaping and prevent injection.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Logic Flaws and Data Exposure via ORM Relationships and Queries

*   **Description:**  While not directly SQL Injection, vulnerabilities can arise from logic flaws in how ORM relationships are defined and queried.  Incorrectly configured relationships or poorly designed queries can lead to unintended data exposure or unauthorized access.

*   **Vulnerability:**  Logical errors in ORM model definitions, relationship configurations, or complex queries that expose data that should be protected or allow unauthorized actions.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**

    1.  **Analyze Application Logic and ORM Relationships:** The attacker studies the application's models and relationships to understand how data is structured and accessed.
    2.  **Identify Weaknesses in Access Control:**  The attacker looks for cases where ORM queries might inadvertently bypass intended access controls or expose data due to relationship configurations.

        For example, consider a scenario where users have access to "projects," and projects have "tasks."  If the application logic relies solely on checking project access and then retrieves all tasks associated with that project *without further access control on tasks*, a vulnerability might exist.

        ```ruby
        # Models (simplified)
        class User < Sequel::Model; one_to_many :projects; end
        class Project < Sequel::Model; one_to_many :tasks; many_to_one :user; end
        class Task < Sequel::Model; many_to_one :project; end

        # Vulnerable controller action (example - simplified for illustration)
        def show_project_tasks(project_id)
          project = Project[project_id]
          unless current_user.can_view?(project) # Assume access control on project
            halt 403, "Unauthorized"
          end
          tasks = project.tasks # Retrieves all tasks associated with the project
          render :tasks, locals: { tasks: tasks }
        end
        ```

        If task-level access control is also required (e.g., some tasks are sensitive and should only be viewable by specific users), this code is vulnerable.  Even if the user is authorized to view the project, they might not be authorized to view *all* tasks within that project.

    3.  **Data Leakage or Unauthorized Access:** By exploiting these logical flaws, attackers can gain access to data they should not be able to see or perform actions they are not authorized for.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    1.  **Implement Fine-Grained Access Control:**  Don't rely solely on high-level access control (e.g., project-level). Implement fine-grained access control at the data level (e.g., task-level, record-level) where necessary.

    2.  **Secure ORM Relationships:** Carefully design and configure ORM relationships, ensuring they accurately reflect access control requirements. Use Sequel's features for filtering related records based on permissions.

    3.  **Review Complex ORM Queries:**  Thoroughly review complex ORM queries, especially those involving relationships and filtering. Ensure they correctly enforce access control and do not inadvertently expose sensitive data.

    4.  **Unit and Integration Testing with Access Control in Mind:**  Write unit and integration tests that specifically verify access control logic within ORM queries and relationships. Test different user roles and permissions to ensure proper authorization.

    5.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Access):**  Design data access patterns to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only retrieve and expose the data that is absolutely necessary for the current operation.

### 5. Conclusion

Compromising an application through Sequel ORM is a significant threat. While Sequel itself provides tools to mitigate SQL Injection (primarily through parameterized queries), developers must use these tools correctly and be aware of potential pitfalls.  Beyond SQL Injection, logical flaws in ORM usage and relationship configurations can also lead to security vulnerabilities.

By understanding these attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly strengthen the security of their applications that utilize Sequel ORM and protect against potential compromise. Regular security assessments, code reviews, and developer training are crucial for maintaining a secure application environment.
