# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a reliable and efficient Ruby SQL database access toolkit for developers.
  - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of SQL databases.
  - Maintain a high level of code quality and stability.
  - Foster an active and supportive community around the library.
- Business Goals:
  - Increase adoption of the Sequel library within the Ruby development community.
  - Provide a robust and feature-rich alternative to other Ruby ORMs and database libraries.
  - Continuously improve the library based on user feedback and evolving database technologies.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches in applications using Sequel.
  - Performance bottlenecks in Sequel could negatively impact application performance.
  - Lack of support for new database features or versions could limit adoption.
  - Bugs or instability could damage the reputation of the library and reduce user trust.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation is likely implemented to prevent SQL injection attacks. (Implemented within the library's query building and execution logic, details in code).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are used to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Part of the development process, see GitHub repository for tests).
  - security control: Code review process is likely in place for contributions to the library. (Standard practice for open-source projects, implied by contribution guidelines).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party database drivers used by Sequel.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of the library by developers leading to insecure database interactions.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Ruby runtime environment itself.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Publish clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using Sequel, focusing on secure database interaction patterns.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process to handle security issues promptly and transparently.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - The library should support various database authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, certificate-based authentication) provided by different database systems.
    - The library itself does not handle user authentication but relies on the underlying database system for authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - The library should respect database-level authorization and permission models.
    - Developers using Sequel are responsible for implementing application-level authorization logic.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library must rigorously validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation should be applied at the query building level to ensure that dynamically constructed queries are safe.
    - The library should provide mechanisms for developers to easily parameterize queries and avoid raw SQL string concatenation.
  - Cryptography:
    - The library should support encrypted connections to databases using protocols like SSL/TLS.
    - The library should allow configuration of encryption settings to ensure secure communication between the application and the database.
    - If the library handles sensitive data in memory (e.g., connection strings), consider secure storage and handling practices.

  - A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code commits (via webhook).
  - The CI system performs the following steps:
    - Fetches the code from the GitHub repository.
    - Runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).
    - Builds the Ruby gem package (build artifacts).
    - Optionally performs security checks (SAST, dependency scanning).
    - Publishes the gem package to RubyGems.org.
- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented in CI system configuration).
  - security control: Code review process before merging code changes to the main branch. (GitHub workflow, pull requests).
  - security control: Use of a CI/CD system to automate the build and release process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency. (CI system configuration).
  - security control: Gem signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the published gem package. (RubyGems.org and gem build process).
  - security control: Dependency scanning in the CI pipeline to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in dependencies. (CI system integration with dependency scanning tools).
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. (CI system integration with SAST tools).
  - security control: Access control to the CI/CD system and RubyGems.org to prevent unauthorized modifications and releases. (CI system and RubyGems.org access management).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing secure and reliable database access for Ruby applications.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Sequel library on RubyGems.org.
  - Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data in applications using Sequel.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The Sequel library itself does not store or process sensitive data directly.
  - Data sensitivity depends on the applications that use Sequel and the databases they connect to.
  - Applications using Sequel may handle highly sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial data, health records) depending on their purpose.
  - The security of Sequel is crucial to protect the data handled by applications that depend on it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used or planned to be used in the Sequel project's CI/CD pipeline?
  - Are there documented security testing procedures and results available for review?
  - What is the process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities reported by the community or identified through security testing?
  - Are there any plans for formal security audits or penetration testing of the Sequel library?
- Assumptions:
  - The Sequel project aims to follow secure coding practices and is committed to addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - The development team has a good understanding of common web application and database security risks, including SQL injection.
  - The RubyGems.org platform provides a reasonably secure environment for distributing Ruby gems.
  - Users of the Sequel library are responsible for implementing application-level security controls and using the library securely.
