Okay, let's create a design document for the Sequel project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Sequel is a lightweight and fast database toolkit for Ruby. It's designed to be flexible, thread-safe, and easy to use, providing a clean and efficient way to interact with various databases.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a reliable and performant database access layer for Ruby applications.
*   Support a wide range of database systems.
*   Offer a user-friendly and flexible API for developers.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and test coverage.
*   Ensure thread safety for concurrent database operations.

Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in databases accessed via Sequel.
*   Data corruption or loss due to vulnerabilities or bugs in Sequel.
*   Performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities affecting applications using Sequel.
*   Compatibility issues with specific database systems or versions.
*   Security vulnerabilities introduced through third-party dependencies.
*   Supply chain attacks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses a continuous integration (CI) system (GitHub Actions) to automate testing and code quality checks. (Described in .github/workflows)
*   security control: The project has extensive test coverage to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Described in spec/)
*   security control: The project follows secure coding practices, such as avoiding SQL injection vulnerabilities by using prepared statements and parameterized queries. (Implicit in the design and implementation of the library)
*   security control: The project uses GitHub's dependabot to automatically update dependencies and address known vulnerabilities. (Described in .github/dependabot.yml)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies on the security of the underlying database systems and their client libraries. Sequel itself does not implement database-level security features like encryption at rest or user authentication.
*   accepted risk: The project assumes that developers using Sequel will follow secure coding practices and properly configure their database systems.
*   accepted risk: The project does not provide built-in protection against all types of denial-of-service attacks.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a security policy that includes guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities and a process for handling security issues.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider using static analysis tools to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
*   security control: Provide documentation and guidance to developers on how to use Sequel securely, including best practices for preventing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Sequel itself does not handle authentication. Authentication is the responsibility of the underlying database system and the application using Sequel.
*   Authorization: Sequel does not implement authorization mechanisms. Authorization is typically handled by the database system and/or the application logic.
*   Input Validation: Sequel uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, effectively validating input to database queries. However, applications using Sequel should still validate user input to prevent other types of vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Sequel does not directly handle encryption. Encryption at rest and in transit should be configured at the database level. Sequel may support encrypted connections (e.g., SSL/TLS) if the underlying database client library supports it.

## DEPLOYMENT

Sequel is a library, not a standalone application, so it doesn't have its own deployment process in the traditional sense. It's deployed as part of a Ruby application. However, we can describe the deployment of a typical Ruby application that uses Sequel.

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Traditional Server Deployment (e.g., using Capistrano, Mina, or similar tools)
2.  Containerized Deployment (e.g., using Docker and Kubernetes)
3.  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Deployment (e.g., using Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk)

Chosen Solution: Containerized Deployment (Docker and Kubernetes)

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitRepo["Git Repository"]
    GitRepo -- "Webhook trigger" --> CI["CI Server (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Checkout code" --> Workspace["Workspace"]
    Workspace -- "Run tests" --> TestResults["Test Results"]
    Workspace -- "Run linters" --> LintResults["Lint Results"]
    Workspace -- "Run SAST" --> SASTResults["SAST Results"]
    Workspace -- "Build gem" --> GemFile["Gem File (sequel.gem)"]
    GemFile -- "Push to" --> GemRepository["Gem Repository (e.g., RubyGems)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI server (GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI server checks out the code into a workspace.
4.  The CI server runs tests (using RSpec or similar).
5.  The CI server runs linters (e.g., RuboCop).
6.  The CI server runs static analysis security testing (SAST) tools (e.g., Brakeman).
7.  If all tests and checks pass, the CI server builds the Sequel gem file (sequel.gem).
8.  The gem file is pushed to a gem repository (e.g., RubyGems.org).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated Testing: Comprehensive test suite ensures code quality and helps prevent regressions.
*   Linting: Enforces coding standards and helps identify potential issues.
*   SAST: Static analysis security testing helps detect vulnerabilities in the code before deployment.
*   Dependency Management: Dependabot (or similar) keeps dependencies up-to-date and addresses known vulnerabilities.
*   Signed Commits: Developers should sign their commits to ensure code integrity.
*   Gem Signing: The released gem should be signed to prevent tampering.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Database access for Ruby applications: Sequel is a critical component for any Ruby application that needs to interact with a database.
*   Data integrity and consistency: Sequel's role in ensuring data is stored and retrieved correctly is crucial for business operations.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Sequel itself does not handle or store data directly. However, it facilitates access to databases, which may contain data of varying sensitivity levels, including:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    *   Financial data
    *   Authentication credentials (if stored in the database)
    *   Proprietary business data
    *   Any other data stored in connected databases.

The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the application using Sequel and the database it connects to.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the applications using Sequel need to adhere to?
*   What are the specific database systems that Sequel will be used with?
*   What is the expected load and concurrency for applications using Sequel?
*   Are there any existing security tools or processes in place that should be integrated with Sequel's development or deployment?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable database access library for Ruby applications.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using Sequel are expected to follow secure coding practices. The underlying database systems are properly secured.
*   DESIGN: The design focuses on providing a clean and efficient API while leveraging the security features of the underlying database systems and client libraries. The deployment environment will be secured according to best practices.
