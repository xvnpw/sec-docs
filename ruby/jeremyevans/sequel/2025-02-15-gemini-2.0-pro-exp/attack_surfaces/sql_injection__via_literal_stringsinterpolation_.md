# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Literal Strings/Interpolation in Sequel

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the SQL Injection vulnerability arising from the misuse of literal strings and string interpolation within the Sequel ORM.  The goal is to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of the risks, demonstrate vulnerable code patterns, and reinforce secure coding practices to prevent this critical vulnerability.  We will also explore edge cases and less obvious attack vectors.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Sequel ORM:**  The analysis is limited to the Sequel library (https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) and its features related to query construction.
*   **Literal Strings and Interpolation:**  We will concentrate on vulnerabilities introduced by directly embedding user-supplied data into SQL strings using Ruby's string interpolation (`#{}`) or manual string concatenation.  We will also examine the misuse of `Sequel.lit`.
*   **Database Agnostic (Mostly):** While the underlying database system (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) can influence the *impact* of a successful SQL injection, the core vulnerability within Sequel remains the same.  We will, however, note database-specific considerations where relevant.
*   **Excludes Other Attack Surfaces:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential SQL injection vectors in Sequel (e.g., vulnerabilities in specific database adapter extensions, though these are less likely).  It also excludes other attack surfaces like XSS, CSRF, etc.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the SQL injection vulnerability in the context of Sequel and string manipulation.
2.  **Code Examples:**  Provide multiple, diverse examples of vulnerable code, demonstrating various ways the vulnerability can be introduced.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Illustrate how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability with specific payloads.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**  Expand on the provided mitigation strategies, offering concrete code examples and best practices.
5.  **Edge Cases and Advanced Considerations:**  Explore less obvious scenarios and potential pitfalls.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Discuss how to test for and verify the absence of this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition

SQL Injection is a code injection technique where an attacker can interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.  In the context of Sequel, the vulnerability arises when user-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization.  This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially altering the query's logic and gaining unauthorized access to the database.  The primary culprits are:

*   **String Interpolation:**  Using Ruby's `#{}` syntax to embed variables directly into SQL strings.
*   **String Concatenation:**  Using the `+` operator to build SQL strings from multiple parts, including user input.
*   **Misuse of `Sequel.lit`:**  Using `Sequel.lit` with unsanitized user input. `Sequel.lit` is designed for *trusted* literal SQL expressions, *not* for handling user input.

### 4.2 Code Examples (Vulnerable)

Here are several examples demonstrating vulnerable code patterns:

**Example 1: Basic String Interpolation**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
username = params[:username] # Assume this comes from a form
DB["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{username}'"].all
```

**Example 2: String Concatenation**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
user_id = params[:id] # Assume this comes from a URL parameter
DB.fetch("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_id).all
```

**Example 3: Misuse of `Sequel.lit`**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
condition = params[:condition] # Assume this comes from a user-controlled source
DB.fetch("SELECT * FROM products WHERE " + Sequel.lit(condition)).all
```

**Example 4:  Indirect Interpolation (More Subtle)**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
column_name = params[:sort_by] # e.g., "name", "price", or malicious input
order = params[:order] # e.g., "ASC", "DESC", or malicious input

# Even if you sanitize 'order', 'column_name' is still vulnerable!
safe_order = order == 'DESC' ? 'DESC' : 'ASC'
DB["SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY #{column_name} #{safe_order}"].all
```
This is vulnerable because an attacker could inject into `column_name`.

**Example 5: Using a helper method (Hidden Vulnerability)**

```ruby
# VULNERABLE
def build_where_clause(field, value)
  "#{field} = '#{value}'" # Vulnerable!
end

where_clause = build_where_clause(params[:field], params[:value])
DB["SELECT * FROM items WHERE #{where_clause}"].all
```
The vulnerability is hidden within the helper function.

### 4.3 Exploitation Scenarios

Let's consider how an attacker might exploit the vulnerable code in Example 1:

**Vulnerable Code:**

```ruby
DB["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{params[:username]}'"].all
```

**Scenario 1:  Bypassing Authentication**

*   **Attacker Input (params[:username]):**  `' OR '1'='1`
*   **Resulting SQL:**  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`
*   **Effect:**  The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, so the query returns *all* users, effectively bypassing authentication.

**Scenario 2:  Data Extraction (Union-Based Injection)**

*   **Attacker Input (params[:username]):**  `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`
*   **Resulting SQL:**  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --'`
*   **Effect:**  The `UNION` operator combines the results of two `SELECT` statements.  The attacker can extract the usernames and passwords from the `users` table.  The `--` comments out the rest of the original query.

**Scenario 3:  Data Modification (Stacked Queries - if supported by the database)**

*   **Attacker Input (params[:username]):**  `'; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; --`
*   **Resulting SQL:**  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; --'`
*   **Effect:**  The attacker changes the password of the 'admin' user.  This relies on the database supporting multiple statements in a single query (e.g., MySQL).

**Scenario 4:  Database Shutdown (Extreme Case)**

*   **Attacker Input (params[:username]):**  `'; SHUTDOWN; --` (MySQL) or similar command for other databases.
*   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; SHUTDOWN; --'`
*   **Effect:** Shuts down the database server.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The *only* reliable way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries (prepared statements).  Here's how to do it correctly with Sequel:

**1.  Use Placeholders (`?`)**

```ruby
# SECURE
username = params[:username]
DB["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username].all

user_id = params[:id]
DB[:users].where(id: user_id).all # Equivalent, and often preferred

#Multiple parameters
DB["SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ? AND price < ?", params[:category], params[:price]].all
```

**2.  Use Dataset Methods (Preferred)**

Sequel's dataset methods (`where`, `filter`, `select`, etc.) automatically handle parameterization:

```ruby
# SECURE
username = params[:username]
DB[:users].where(username: username).all

# More complex example
DB[:products].where{price > params[:min_price]}.where{price < params[:max_price]}.all
```

**3.  `Sequel.lit` - Use with EXTREME CAUTION (and only with trusted data)**

`Sequel.lit` should *never* be used directly with user input.  It's intended for literal SQL fragments that you, the developer, control.  If you *must* use it with dynamic values, you *must* manually escape the values using the database-specific escaping function (which is generally discouraged).

```ruby
# SECURE (but generally avoid this pattern)
column = Sequel.identifier(params[:column]) # Sanitize the column name
DB.fetch("SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY #{column}").all

#AVOID - Example of what NOT to do
#DB.fetch("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + Sequel.lit(params[:id])).all # Extremely Vulnerable
```
Use `Sequel.identifier` to safely insert identifiers.

**4.  Input Validation (Defense in Depth)**

While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation adds another layer of security:

*   **Whitelist Allowed Values:**  If a parameter should only have a limited set of values (e.g., "ASC" or "DESC" for sorting), validate it against a whitelist.
*   **Type Checking:**  Ensure that numeric parameters are actually numbers, etc.
*   **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of input strings to reasonable values.

**5.  Least Privilege Principle**

Ensure that the database user your application connects with has only the necessary privileges.  Don't use a superuser account.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they succeed with SQL injection.

**6.  Code Reviews**

Mandatory code reviews should specifically look for any instances of string interpolation or concatenation within SQL queries.  Automated code analysis tools can also help.

### 4.5 Edge Cases and Advanced Considerations

*   **Stored Procedures:**  Even if you use parameterized queries to call stored procedures, the stored procedure itself could be vulnerable to SQL injection if it uses dynamic SQL with unsanitized input.
*   **Database-Specific Features:**  Some databases have features that might introduce subtle vulnerabilities.  For example, MySQL's `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` can be abused if an attacker can control the filename.
*   **ORM Bugs:**  While rare, it's theoretically possible for a bug in Sequel itself to introduce a SQL injection vulnerability.  Keep Sequel updated to the latest version.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  Even if the application doesn't directly display the results of a query, an attacker can still extract data using techniques like time-based blind SQL injection.
* **Second-Order SQL Injection:** Stored data that is later used in a query without proper sanitization.

### 4.6 Testing and Verification

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Attempt to inject SQL code using various payloads (as described in the Exploitation Scenarios section).
*   **Automated Vulnerability Scanners:**  Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or SQLMap to automatically scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your code.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically try to inject malicious input into your database queries.  These tests should *fail* if the code is vulnerable.  For example:

    ```ruby
    # Example Unit Test (using RSpec)
    it "is not vulnerable to SQL injection in username" do
      expect {
        DB["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{' OR 1=1 --'}'"].all
      }.to raise_error(Sequel::DatabaseError) # Expect an error, not a successful query
    end
    ```

## 5. Conclusion

SQL Injection via literal strings and interpolation is a critical vulnerability that can be completely avoided by consistently using parameterized queries and Sequel's dataset methods.  Developers must be vigilant and avoid any direct embedding of user input into SQL strings.  Regular code reviews, security testing, and adherence to the principle of least privilege are essential for maintaining a secure application.  By following the guidelines outlined in this analysis, developers can effectively eliminate this significant attack surface.
