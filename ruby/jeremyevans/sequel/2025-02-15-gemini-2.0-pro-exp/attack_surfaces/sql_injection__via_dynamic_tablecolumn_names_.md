# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Dynamic Table/Column Names in Sequel

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with using user-supplied data to construct table and column names within Sequel queries.  We aim to identify specific vulnerability patterns, assess the potential impact, and reinforce robust mitigation strategies to prevent SQL injection attacks exploiting this attack surface.  This analysis will inform development practices and code reviews to ensure secure usage of Sequel's dynamic features.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the SQL injection vulnerability arising from the use of dynamic table and column names within Sequel, an ORM for Ruby.  It covers:

*   Sequel's features that enable dynamic table/column selection.
*   How user input can be maliciously crafted to exploit these features.
*   The potential consequences of successful exploitation.
*   Specific, actionable mitigation techniques applicable to Sequel development.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., those related to parameter values).
*   Other security vulnerabilities unrelated to SQL injection.
*   Security aspects of database configuration or infrastructure.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review Pattern Identification:**  We will identify common code patterns in Sequel that are susceptible to this type of SQL injection.  This includes examining how `DB[]`, `.select()`, `.order()`, and other relevant methods are used with dynamic identifiers.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Construction:**  We will develop concrete examples of how an attacker might craft malicious input to exploit these vulnerable patterns.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will analyze the potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering data breaches, data modification, and denial-of-service scenarios.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Validation:**  We will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (whitelisting, indirect mapping) and identify any potential weaknesses or limitations.
5.  **Best Practice Recommendations:** We will formulate clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.

### 4.1. Vulnerable Code Patterns

Sequel's flexibility in accessing database objects dynamically is the root cause of this vulnerability.  Here are the key patterns:

*   **Dynamic Table Selection:** `DB[params[:table].to_sym]` -  This directly uses a parameter (presumably from user input) to select the table.  An attacker could supply `users; DROP TABLE users; --` or a similar malicious string. Even though the `where` clause might use parameterized queries, the table name itself is vulnerable.

*   **Dynamic Column Selection:** `dataset.select(params[:column].to_sym)` -  Similar to table selection, this allows an attacker to specify the column to be selected.  This could be used to access columns the user shouldn't have access to, or to inject SQL code.

*   **Dynamic Ordering:** `dataset.order(params[:order_column].to_sym)` -  Allows an attacker to control the `ORDER BY` clause, potentially leading to information disclosure or, in some database systems, injection.

*   **Dynamic Filtering with Identifier Literals:** While less common, using `Sequel.identifier(params[:column])` *without proper validation* is equally dangerous.  `Sequel.identifier` simply quotes the input, making it suitable for use as a table or column name, but it *does not* sanitize it against SQL injection.

* **Chained Dynamic Operations:** Combining multiple dynamic operations increases the attack surface. For example:
    ```ruby
    DB[params[:table].to_sym].select(params[:column].to_sym).where(id: params[:id])
    ```

### 4.2. Exploit Scenarios

Let's illustrate with a few scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Table Enumeration:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `DB[params[:table].to_sym].all`
    *   **Attacker Input:** `params[:table] = "information_schema.tables"`
    *   **Result:** The attacker can list all tables in the database, gaining valuable reconnaissance information.

*   **Scenario 2: Data Exfiltration (via UNION):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `DB[:users].select(params[:column].to_sym).all`
    *   **Attacker Input:** `params[:column] = "id, (SELECT password FROM users WHERE id = 1) AS password"`
    *   **Result:**  If the database allows subqueries in the `SELECT` list, the attacker might be able to retrieve the password of user with ID 1, even if the application normally only displays the `id`.

*   **Scenario 3: Data Modification (via stacked queries):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `DB[params[:table].to_sym].where(id: params[:id])`
    *   **Attacker Input:** `params[:table] = "users; UPDATE users SET admin = true WHERE id = 2; --"` and `params[:id] = 1`
    *   **Result:** The attacker elevates user with ID 2 to administrator privileges. The `where` clause is irrelevant because the attacker has injected a separate `UPDATE` statement.

*   **Scenario 4: Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `DB[:users].order(params[:order_column].to_sym).all`
    *   **Attacker Input:** `params[:order_column] = "CASE WHEN (SELECT 1 FROM pg_sleep(10)) THEN 1 ELSE 2 END"`
    *   **Result:**  The attacker forces the database to execute a long-running query (`pg_sleep(10)`), potentially causing a denial of service.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation is **critical**:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from any table they can name, including user credentials, financial information, and personal data.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter data, potentially corrupting the database, changing user roles, or manipulating financial records.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers can delete entire tables or specific records, leading to data loss.
*   **Database Compromise:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to gain control of the database server itself, depending on the database system and its configuration.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can make the application unusable by injecting long-running or resource-intensive queries.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode user trust.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategy Validation

The proposed mitigation strategies are generally effective, but require careful implementation:

*   **Whitelisting:** This is the *most robust* defense.  Create a predefined list (array, hash, or enum) of allowed table and column names.  *Before* constructing the Sequel query, validate the user-provided input against this whitelist.  If the input is not in the whitelist, reject the request.

    ```ruby
    ALLOWED_TABLES = [:users, :products, :orders].freeze
    ALLOWED_COLUMNS = [:id, :name, :email, :created_at].freeze

    def get_data(table, column)
      raise "Invalid table" unless ALLOWED_TABLES.include?(table.to_sym)
      raise "Invalid column" unless ALLOWED_COLUMNS.include?(column.to_sym)

      DB[table.to_sym].select(column.to_sym).all
    end
    ```

*   **Indirect Mapping (Lookup Tables/Enums):**  Instead of directly using user input, use it as a key to look up the actual table or column name in a trusted mapping.  This adds a layer of indirection that prevents direct injection.

    ```ruby
    TABLE_MAP = {
      "user_data" => :users,
      "product_list" => :products,
    }.freeze

    def get_data(table_key)
      table = TABLE_MAP[table_key]
      raise "Invalid table key" if table.nil?

      DB[table].all
    end
    ```

*   **Avoid Dynamic Construction:**  The best approach is to avoid dynamic table/column names altogether whenever possible.  If the logic can be expressed with static table and column names, do so.

* **Potential Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incomplete Whitelist:**  If the whitelist is not comprehensive, attackers might find a way to bypass it.  Regularly review and update the whitelist.
    *   **Case Sensitivity:**  Ensure that the whitelist and input validation are case-insensitive (or consistently case-sensitive) to prevent bypasses.
    *   **Type Confusion:** Ensure that input is of the expected type (e.g., string) before validation.
    * **Complex Logic:** If the logic for determining the table/column name is overly complex, it may introduce vulnerabilities. Keep it simple and easily auditable.

### 4.5. Best Practice Recommendations

1.  **Never Trust User Input:**  Treat *all* user input as potentially malicious, even if it comes from seemingly trusted sources.
2.  **Strict Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist for table and column names.  This is the primary defense.
3.  **Indirect Mapping:**  Use lookup tables or enums to map user-provided identifiers to database identifiers.
4.  **Avoid Dynamic Names When Possible:**  Prefer static table and column names whenever feasible.
5.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on Sequel query construction and input validation.
6.  **Automated Security Testing:**  Incorporate automated security testing tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis) into the development pipeline to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
7.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges.  Avoid using accounts with excessive permissions.
8. **Educate Developers:** Provide training to developers on secure coding practices, including the risks of SQL injection and how to prevent it in Sequel.
9. **Use Prepared Statements (for values):** While this analysis focuses on dynamic identifiers, *always* use prepared statements (parameterized queries) for *values* to prevent traditional SQL injection. Sequel handles this well, but it's crucial to remember.
10. **Keep Sequel Updated:** Regularly update Sequel to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

By following these recommendations, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities related to dynamic table and column names in Sequel-based applications. The key is to be proactive, defensive, and prioritize security throughout the development lifecycle.
