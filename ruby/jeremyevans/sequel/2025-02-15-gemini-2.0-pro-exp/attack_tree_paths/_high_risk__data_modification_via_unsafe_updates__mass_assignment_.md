# Deep Analysis: Data Modification via Unsafe Updates (Mass Assignment) with SQL Injection in `where()`

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the specific attack vector of SQL injection within the `where` clause of Sequel's mass assignment methods (e.g., `update`, `update_all`), understand its potential impact, and provide concrete mitigation strategies for developers using the Sequel ORM.  This analysis aims to provide actionable guidance to prevent this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Sequel ORM:**  Specifically, the use of Sequel's mass assignment methods (`update`, `update_all`, etc.) in conjunction with the `where` clause.
*   **SQL Injection:**  The exploitation of vulnerabilities in how user-supplied data is incorporated into the `where` clause, leading to unintended SQL execution.
*   **Data Modification:** The primary impact considered is unauthorized modification of database records, including privilege escalation and data corruption.
*   **Ruby Environment:**  The analysis assumes a Ruby environment where Sequel is used.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other forms of SQL injection outside of the `where` clause in mass assignment updates.
*   Other vulnerabilities in Sequel unrelated to mass assignment or SQL injection.
*   Non-Ruby environments.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Explanation:**  Provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including how it works and the underlying principles.
2.  **Code Examples:**  Present vulnerable code examples in Ruby using Sequel, demonstrating the attack.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful exploit, including specific examples.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide detailed, actionable mitigation strategies with code examples, prioritizing the most effective solutions.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest testing approaches to identify and prevent this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQLi in Mass Update `.where()`

### 4.1 Vulnerability Explanation

This vulnerability combines two dangerous practices:

*   **Mass Assignment:**  The ability to update multiple database columns at once using a hash of attributes (often derived directly from user input, like `params` in a web framework).
*   **SQL Injection in `where()`:**  The ability for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `where` clause of a database query.

When combined, an attacker can:

1.  **Bypass Access Controls:**  Use SQL injection in the `where` clause to select records they shouldn't be able to access.  For example, they might target records belonging to other users or records with specific sensitive data.
2.  **Modify Arbitrary Data:**  Use the mass assignment feature to modify fields within those selected records, even fields they are not normally allowed to change.

The core issue is the *unfiltered* inclusion of user-supplied data within the SQL query's `where` clause.  Sequel, by default, does *not* automatically sanitize input used in `where` clauses when used in this way.  It's the developer's responsibility to ensure safety.

### 4.2 Vulnerable Code Examples

**Example 1: Privilege Escalation**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
class User < Sequel::Model
end

# Attacker sends a request with params[:id] = "1' OR 1=1 --" and params[:admin] = true
User.where("id = '#{params[:id]}'").update(admin: params[:admin])
```

**Explanation:**

*   The attacker crafts `params[:id]` to be `1' OR 1=1 --`.
*   The resulting SQL query becomes: `UPDATE "users" SET "admin" = 't' WHERE (id = '1' OR 1=1 --')`
*   The `OR 1=1` condition makes the `WHERE` clause always true, selecting *all* users.
*   The `--` comments out any remaining part of the original query.
*   The `update` sets the `admin` column to `true` for all users, granting them administrator privileges.

**Example 2: Data Corruption**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
class Product < Sequel::Model
end

# Attacker sends params[:id] = "1' OR category='sensitive' --" and params[:price] = 0
Product.where("id = '#{params[:id]}'").update(price: params[:price])
```

**Explanation:**

*   The attacker crafts `params[:id]` to target products in a specific category.
*   The resulting SQL: `UPDATE "products" SET "price" = 0 WHERE (id = '1' OR category='sensitive' --')`
*   This sets the price of all products in the 'sensitive' category to 0.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of this vulnerability can be severe:

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers can gain administrative access, allowing them to control the entire application and its data.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Attackers can modify or delete critical data, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, or service disruption.
*   **Data Disclosure (Indirect):** While this attack primarily focuses on modification, it can indirectly lead to data disclosure.  For example, an attacker might modify a user's password reset token to a known value, then use that to gain access to the user's account.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  In some cases, a poorly crafted SQL injection might cause database errors or performance issues, leading to a denial of service.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

Here are the crucial mitigation strategies, ordered by importance and effectiveness:

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) - *Highest Priority***

    *   **Description:**  Use Sequel's parameterized query features to separate the SQL code from the data.  This prevents the attacker's input from being interpreted as SQL code.
    *   **Code Example:**

        ```ruby
        # Safe Code - Parameterized Query
        User.where(id: params[:id]).update(admin: params[:admin])  # Safe if params[:id] is a single value

        # OR, for more complex conditions:
        User.where("id = ?", params[:id]).update(admin: params[:admin]) # Also safe

        # Even safer, combine with set_allowed_columns:
        class User < Sequel::Model
          set_allowed_columns :name, :email # Only allow these to be mass-assigned
        end
        User.where("id = ?", params[:id]).update(params) # Still safe, even with full params
        ```

    *   **Explanation:** Sequel translates this into a prepared statement, where `params[:id]` is treated as a *value* and not part of the SQL code.  The database handles the escaping and sanitization.

2.  **`set_allowed_columns` / `set_fields` - *Essential for Mass Assignment***

    *   **Description:**  Explicitly define which columns are allowed to be updated via mass assignment.  This creates a whitelist, preventing attackers from modifying unauthorized fields.
    *   **Code Example:**

        ```ruby
        class User < Sequel::Model
          set_allowed_columns :name, :email  # Only allow these to be mass-assigned
        end

        # Now, even if params contains :admin, it will be ignored:
        User.where(id: params[:id]).update(params) # :admin is ignored
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This limits the scope of mass assignment, preventing attackers from tampering with sensitive columns like `admin`, `password_hash`, etc.

3.  **Manual Hash Construction - *Alternative to `set_allowed_columns`***

    *   **Description:**  Instead of passing the entire `params` hash to `update`, create a new hash containing only the permitted fields and their values.
    *   **Code Example:**

        ```ruby
        # Safe Code - Manual Hash Construction
        safe_params = {
          name: params[:name],
          email: params[:email]
        }
        User.where(id: params[:id]).update(safe_params)
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This provides fine-grained control over which attributes are updated, similar to `set_allowed_columns`.

4.  **Input Validation - *Always a Good Practice***

    *   **Description:**  Validate *all* user input to ensure it conforms to expected types, formats, and constraints.  This is a general security best practice and helps prevent other types of attacks.
    *   **Code Example:**

        ```ruby
        # Example using a validation library (e.g., dry-validation)
        class UpdateUserContract < Dry::Validation::Contract
          params do
            required(:id).filled(:integer)
            required(:name).filled(:string)
            optional(:email).maybe(:string)
          end
        end

        contract = UpdateUserContract.new
        result = contract.call(params)

        if result.success?
          User.where(id: result[:id]).update(name: result[:name], email: result[:email])
        else
          # Handle validation errors
        end
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Input validation helps ensure that the data being used in the query is of the expected type and format, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.  It's a crucial layer of defense, even with parameterized queries.

5.  **Avoid String Interpolation in `where` - *Absolutely Critical***
    * **Description:** Never, ever use string interpolation (e.g., `#{}`) directly within the `where` clause with user-supplied data. This is the root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability.
    * **Code Example (BAD - DO NOT USE):**
        ```ruby
        User.where("id = '#{params[:id]}'").update(...) # VULNERABLE!
        ```
    * **Explanation:** String interpolation directly embeds the value of `params[:id]` into the SQL string, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

### 4.5 Testing Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., Brakeman for Ruby) to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in your code.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing, either manually or using automated tools, to attempt to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This should include attempts to bypass access controls and modify data.
*   **Unit/Integration Tests:**  Write unit and integration tests that specifically test the mass assignment functionality with various inputs, including malicious inputs designed to trigger SQL injection.  These tests should verify that:
    *   Only allowed columns are updated.
    *   Unauthorized updates are rejected.
    *   SQL injection attempts are blocked.
*   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to how user input is used in database queries, especially within `where` clauses and mass assignment methods.

## 5. Conclusion

The combination of mass assignment and SQL injection in Sequel's `where` clause is a high-risk vulnerability.  By consistently using parameterized queries, implementing `set_allowed_columns` (or manual hash construction), and performing thorough input validation, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and protect their applications from data breaches and corruption.  Regular testing and code reviews are essential to ensure that these defenses remain in place.
