# Deep Analysis: Mass Assignment in Sequel

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to:

*   Fully understand the mechanics of mass assignment vulnerabilities within the context of Sequel.
*   Identify specific code patterns that introduce this vulnerability.
*   Provide concrete examples of both vulnerable and secure code.
*   Establish clear guidelines and best practices for developers to prevent mass assignment.
*   Explain how to test for this vulnerability.
*   Explain the difference between `set`, `set_only`, and `set_fields`.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on mass assignment vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of Sequel's `Model#set`, `Model#update`, and `Model.new` methods (and their variants).  It covers:

*   Direct use of these methods with user-supplied data.
*   Indirect exposure through wrapper methods or framework integrations.
*   Scenarios involving both single model updates and bulk operations.
*   The interaction of mass assignment with other security concerns (e.g., authorization).

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).  These are separate threats.
*   Vulnerabilities arising from other ORMs or database libraries.
*   General application security best practices unrelated to mass assignment.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of Sequel's source code and documentation to understand the intended behavior of relevant methods.
*   **Vulnerability Reproduction:** Creation of simplified, vulnerable code examples to demonstrate the exploit.
*   **Secure Code Examples:**  Development of corresponding secure code examples that mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Testing Strategies:**  Description of methods for identifying mass assignment vulnerabilities through testing.
*   **Best Practices Definition:**  Formulation of clear, actionable guidelines for developers.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Understanding the Vulnerability

Mass assignment occurs when an application allows an attacker to set arbitrary model attributes by supplying unexpected input parameters.  Sequel, like many ORMs, provides convenience methods (`set`, `update`) for updating model instances.  If these methods are used with unfiltered user input, an attacker can manipulate attributes they shouldn't have access to.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
class User < Sequel::Model
end

# Assume params comes directly from a web request
params = { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", admin: true }

user = User[1] # Load user with ID 1
user.update(params) # Vulnerable!  Updates 'admin' to true.

# OR

user = User.new
user.set(params)
user.save # Vulnerable! Creates a new admin user.
```

In this example, the attacker provides an `admin: true` parameter.  Because `update` and `set` are used without any restrictions, Sequel updates the `admin` attribute in the database, granting the attacker administrator privileges.

### 4.2. Sequel's Protective Mechanisms

Sequel provides several mechanisms to prevent mass assignment:

*   **`set_only(values, columns)` / `update_only(values, columns)`:**  These methods *only* update the attributes specified in the `columns` array.  Any other attributes in the `values` hash are ignored. This is the **recommended approach**.

*   **`set_fields(values, fields)` / `update_fields(values, fields)`:** These methods update attributes present in the `values` hash *only if* they are also present in the `fields` array.  This is also a safe approach, but requires careful management of the `fields` array.

*   **`strict_param_setting`:** This option, when set to `false` on a model, will raise an error if you try to set a column that doesn't exist. While helpful, it doesn't prevent setting *existing* but unauthorized columns.  It's a good practice, but not a complete solution for mass assignment.

**Example (Secure Code):**

```ruby
class User < Sequel::Model
end

params = { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", admin: true }

user = User[1]
user.update_only(params, [:name, :email]) # Safe!  'admin' is ignored.

# OR

user = User.new
user.set_only(params, [:name, :email])
user.save # Safe!

# OR

user = User[1]
user.update_fields(params, [:name, :email]) # Safe!

# OR

user = User.new
user.set_fields(params, [:name, :email])
user.save # Safe!
```

### 4.3. `set`, `set_only`, and `set_fields` Explained

*   **`set(values)`:**  This method attempts to set *all* attributes provided in the `values` hash.  It's inherently unsafe for use with unfiltered user input.

*   **`set_only(values, columns)`:** This method sets attributes from the `values` hash, but *only* if the attribute name is present in the `columns` array.  This is the safest and most explicit way to control which attributes can be modified.

*   **`set_fields(values, fields)`:** This method sets attributes from the `values` hash, but *only* if the attribute name is present in *both* the `values` hash *and* the `fields` array. This provides a whitelist, but requires that the attribute be present in the input.

The key difference between `set_only` and `set_fields` is how they handle missing keys.  If a key is in `columns` but *not* in `values` for `set_only`, the attribute will *not* be modified (it won't be set to `nil`).  With `set_fields`, if a key is in `fields` but not in `values`, it also won't be modified.  `set_only` is generally preferred for its clarity and explicitness.

### 4.4.  `Model.new` and Mass Assignment

`Model.new` itself doesn't directly cause mass assignment.  The vulnerability arises when you combine `Model.new` with unfiltered input *and then immediately save the model*.

```ruby
# Vulnerable
params = { name: "Evil Hacker", admin: true }
user = User.new(params) # No immediate vulnerability
user.save  # NOW it's vulnerable!

# Safe
params = { name: "Evil Hacker", admin: true }
user = User.new
user.set_only(params, [:name]) # Or set_fields
user.save # Safe
```

### 4.5. Testing for Mass Assignment

Testing for mass assignment vulnerabilities requires a combination of techniques:

*   **Unit Tests:** Create tests that specifically attempt to set unauthorized attributes.  These tests should assert that the unauthorized attributes are *not* modified.

    ```ruby
    # Example (RSpec)
    it "does not allow setting the admin attribute via mass assignment" do
      user = User.create(name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com")
      expect {
        user.update_only({ admin: true }, [:name, :email])
      }.not_to change { user.reload.admin }
      expect(user.admin).to be(false) # Or whatever the default is

      user = User.new
      expect {
        user.set_only({name: "Test", admin: true}, [:name])
        user.save
      }.not_to change { user.admin }
    end
    ```

*   **Integration Tests:**  Simulate user interactions (e.g., form submissions) that include unexpected parameters.  Verify that the application behaves correctly and does not allow unauthorized updates.

*   **Code Audits:**  Regularly review code for any instances of `set` or `update` used without `_only` or `_fields` variants, or any use of `new` followed by an immediate save with unfiltered parameters.

*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Some static analysis tools can detect potential mass assignment vulnerabilities.

### 4.6.  Best Practices

1.  **Always use `set_only` or `update_only` (preferred) or `set_fields` or `update_fields` when updating existing records.**  Never use `set` or `update` directly with user-supplied data.

2.  **When creating new records with `Model.new`, use `set_only` or `set_fields` before saving.** Do not pass unfiltered parameters directly to `Model.new` followed by a `save`.

3.  **Implement a parameter filtering mechanism.**  Even if you're not using a framework like Rails with strong parameters, create a function or class that explicitly whitelists allowed parameters *before* they reach your Sequel models.

4.  **Regularly audit your code for potential mass assignment vulnerabilities.**

5.  **Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify that mass assignment is prevented.**

6.  **Consider using `strict_param_setting => false` on your models to catch attempts to set non-existent columns, but remember this is not a complete solution for mass assignment.**

7. **Understand the context:** If a user *should* be able to update a field, ensure proper authorization checks are in place *before* allowing the update, even with `set_only`. Mass assignment protection prevents unauthorized *attributes* from being set; authorization prevents unauthorized *users* from making changes.

By following these guidelines, developers can effectively eliminate mass assignment vulnerabilities in their Sequel-based applications.
