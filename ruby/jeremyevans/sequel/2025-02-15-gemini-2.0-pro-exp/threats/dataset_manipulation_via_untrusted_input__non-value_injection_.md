# Deep Analysis: Dataset Manipulation via Untrusted Input (Non-Value Injection) in Sequel

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Dataset Manipulation via Untrusted Input (Non-Value Injection)" threat within the context of a Ruby application using the Sequel ORM.  This includes:

*   Identifying specific attack vectors and vulnerable code patterns.
*   Assessing the potential impact of successful exploitation.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Providing concrete examples and recommendations to developers.
*   Going beyond the basic description to explore edge cases and subtle vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat as described: manipulation of Sequel dataset methods *other than* value injection (traditional SQLi).  We will consider:

*   **Sequel Versions:**  The analysis is generally applicable to all versions of Sequel, but we'll note any version-specific differences if they exist.  We'll assume a reasonably recent version (e.g., 5.x) for examples.
*   **Database Systems:** While Sequel supports multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.), the core principles of this threat apply across all of them.  We'll highlight any database-specific nuances where relevant.
*   **Application Context:** We'll assume a typical web application scenario where user input (from forms, API requests, etc.) is used to construct database queries.
*   **Exclusions:**  We will *not* focus on traditional SQL injection (value injection), as that is a separate threat.  We also won't cover general security best practices unrelated to this specific threat (e.g., authentication, authorization).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  We'll start with the provided threat description and expand upon it.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical and Example):** We'll analyze hypothetical and example Sequel code snippets to identify vulnerable patterns and demonstrate exploits.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We'll critically assess the proposed mitigation strategies, considering their effectiveness, limitations, and potential bypasses.
4.  **Best Practice Recommendations:** We'll provide clear, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.
5.  **Documentation Review:** We'll consult the Sequel documentation to ensure our understanding and recommendations align with the library's intended usage and security features.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Threat Description Refinement

The original threat description is a good starting point, but we can refine it further:

*   **Beyond Basic Methods:**  The threat extends beyond the explicitly listed methods (`order`, `select`, `join`, `group`, `having`).  *Any* Sequel method that accepts identifiers (table names, column names) or SQL fragments as arguments is potentially vulnerable.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `Dataset#from`
    *   `Dataset#select_append`
    *   `Dataset#select_more`
    *   `Dataset#with` (for common table expressions)
    *   `Dataset#literal` (if used improperly to construct SQL fragments)
    *   `Dataset#[]` (for accessing columns)
    *   Methods that use `Sequel.lit` internally.
*   **Subtle Manipulations:**  The impact isn't just about *completely* changing the query.  Even small changes can have significant consequences.  For example, changing the `order` from ascending to descending might seem minor, but it could expose different data or affect pagination logic.
*   **Denial of Service Nuances:**  DoS attacks can be subtle.  An attacker might not need to crash the database server; they could simply make a specific query extremely slow, affecting the responsiveness of the application for other users.  This could involve:
    *   Forcing a full table scan by manipulating the `order` or `where` clause.
    *   Creating a Cartesian product by manipulating joins.
    *   Using computationally expensive functions in `select` or `having`.
*   **Data Modification Edge Cases:** While less common, data modification is possible in certain scenarios.  For example:
    *   If the application uses `update` or `delete` with a dynamically constructed `where` clause based on user input, the attacker could broaden the scope of the modification.
    *   Some databases might have specific features or extensions that allow for data modification through seemingly read-only operations (e.g., using functions with side effects in `select`).
* **Indirect Data Leakage:** Even if direct data exposure is prevented, attackers might use timing attacks or error messages to infer information about the database structure or data.

### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Vulnerable Code Examples

Let's examine some concrete examples of vulnerable code and how an attacker might exploit them:

**Example 1: Unvalidated `order` Clause**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
get '/users' do
  order_by = params[:order_by] || 'id' # Default to 'id', but still vulnerable
  @users = DB[:users].order(order_by).all
  erb :users
end
```

**Exploit:**

An attacker could send a request like:

`/users?order_by=CASE WHEN (SELECT sleep(5)) THEN id ELSE name END`

This would inject a `CASE` statement into the `ORDER BY` clause, causing a 5-second delay.  This is a simple DoS attack, but it demonstrates the principle.  A more sophisticated attacker could use this to extract information through timing attacks.

**Example 2: Unvalidated `select` Clause**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
get '/products' do
  select_fields = params[:fields] || 'id,name' # Default, but still vulnerable
  @products = DB[:products].select(*select_fields.split(',')).all
  erb :products
end
```

**Exploit:**

An attacker could send a request like:

`/products?fields=id,name,(SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=1)`

This would attempt to select the password of the user with ID 1.  Whether this succeeds depends on the database and Sequel's handling of subqueries in `select`, but it's a clear attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Example 3: Unvalidated `join` Clause**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
get '/orders' do
  join_table = params[:join_table] || 'order_items'
  @orders = DB[:orders].join(join_table.to_sym, order_id: :id).all
  erb :orders
end
```

**Exploit:**

An attacker could send a request like:

`/orders?join_table=users`

This would join the `orders` table with the `users` table, potentially exposing user data alongside order information.  A more sophisticated attack could use a crafted join condition to further refine the exposed data.

**Example 4: Unvalidated `from` Clause**

```ruby
#Vulnerable Code
get '/data' do
  table_name = params[:table] || 'products'
  @data = DB[table_name.to_sym].all
  erb :data
end
```
**Exploit:**
An attacker could send a request like:
`/data?table=users`
This would allow the attacker to read all data from users table.

**Example 5: Using `literal` unsafely**

```ruby
# Vulnerable Code
get '/search' do
  search_term = params[:term]
  # VERY DANGEROUS: Directly embedding user input into a literal SQL fragment.
  @results = DB[:products].where(Sequel.lit("name LIKE '%#{search_term}%'")).all
  erb :search_results
end
```

**Exploit:**

While this *looks* like value injection, it's actually worse because `Sequel.lit` bypasses Sequel's usual parameter binding.  An attacker could inject *any* SQL here, including `DROP TABLE products; --`. This is a catastrophic vulnerability.  **Never use `Sequel.lit` with unsanitized user input.**

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies:

1.  **Strict Whitelists:** This is the **most effective** and **recommended** approach.  For every dataset method that accepts user input, define a whitelist of allowed values (column names, table names, etc.).  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.

    ```ruby
    # Good: Using a whitelist for order_by
    ALLOWED_ORDER_COLUMNS = ['id', 'name', 'created_at'].freeze

    get '/users' do
      order_by = params[:order_by]
      if ALLOWED_ORDER_COLUMNS.include?(order_by)
        @users = DB[:users].order(order_by.to_sym).all
      else
        # Handle invalid input (e.g., return an error, use a default)
        @users = DB[:users].order(:id).all
      end
      erb :users
    end
    ```

    *   **Effectiveness:** High.  Prevents any unexpected input from reaching the query.
    *   **Limitations:** Requires careful maintenance of the whitelist as the application evolves.
    *   **Bypasses:**  None, if implemented correctly.

2.  **`Sequel.identifier`:** This method is useful for explicitly marking strings as identifiers, but it's **not a substitute for whitelisting**.  It *must* be used in conjunction with whitelisting.

    ```ruby
    # Better, but still requires whitelisting:
    ALLOWED_ORDER_COLUMNS = ['id', 'name', 'created_at'].freeze

    get '/users' do
      order_by = params[:order_by]
      if ALLOWED_ORDER_COLUMNS.include?(order_by)
        @users = DB[:users].order(Sequel.identifier(order_by)).all
      else
        # Handle invalid input
        @users = DB[:users].order(:id).all
      end
      erb :users
    end
    ```

    *   **Effectiveness:** Moderate.  Provides some protection against basic injection, but relies on the developer to remember to use it *and* validate the input.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent all attacks (e.g., an attacker could still provide a valid but unintended column name).
    *   **Bypasses:**  Easily bypassed if used without whitelisting.

3.  **Validate and Sanitize:** This is a general principle, but it's crucial.  Even if you're using whitelists and `Sequel.identifier`, you should still validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats.  This can help prevent unexpected behavior and catch errors early.

    *   **Effectiveness:**  Moderate.  Helps prevent some attacks, but doesn't address the core vulnerability of structural manipulation.
    *   **Limitations:**  Difficult to implement comprehensively.  It's easy to miss edge cases.
    *   **Bypasses:**  Many.  Sanitization is often incomplete or flawed.

4.  **Controlled API:** This is a good architectural approach.  Instead of allowing users to directly construct dataset chains, provide a limited, pre-defined API for querying data.  This gives you complete control over the generated SQL.

    ```ruby
    # Example of a controlled API
    def get_users(sort_by: 'id', sort_direction: 'asc')
      allowed_sort_columns = { 'id' => :id, 'name' => :name, 'created_at' => :created_at }
      allowed_directions = { 'asc' => :asc, 'desc' => :desc }

      column = allowed_sort_columns[sort_by] || :id
      direction = allowed_directions[sort_direction] || :asc

      DB[:users].order(column, direction).all
    end
    ```

    *   **Effectiveness:** High.  Provides strong control over query construction.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires more upfront design and development effort.  May be less flexible than allowing arbitrary queries.
    *   **Bypasses:**  None, if implemented correctly.

### 4.4. Best Practice Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Whitelisting:**  Use strict whitelists for *all* dataset methods that accept user input. This is the most important recommendation.
2.  **Use `Sequel.identifier` *with* Whitelisting:**  Always use `Sequel.identifier` to mark identifiers, but *only after* validating them against a whitelist.
3.  **Avoid `Sequel.lit` with User Input:**  Never, under any circumstances, use `Sequel.lit` with unsanitized user input.
4.  **Implement a Controlled Query API:**  Design a controlled API for data access, limiting the user's ability to construct arbitrary queries.
5.  **Validate Input Types:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected data types (e.g., integers, strings with specific formats).
6.  **Log and Monitor Queries:**  Log all generated SQL queries and monitor for suspicious patterns or errors. This can help detect attacks and identify vulnerabilities.
7.  **Regularly Review Code:**  Conduct regular security code reviews, focusing on Sequel usage and input validation.
8.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep Sequel and your database system up to date to benefit from security patches.
9.  **Consider Prepared Statements (if applicable):** While Sequel handles parameter binding, using explicit prepared statements at the database level can provide an additional layer of defense (though this is more relevant for value injection).
10. **Test Thoroughly:**  Include security-focused tests in your test suite, specifically targeting potential injection vulnerabilities. Use fuzzing techniques to test with unexpected inputs.

### 4.5. Conclusion
Dataset manipulation via untrusted input is a serious threat to applications using Sequel. By understanding the attack vectors, evaluating mitigation strategies, and following best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. Whitelisting is paramount, and a controlled query API provides a robust defense. Continuous vigilance, code review, and testing are essential for maintaining a secure application.
