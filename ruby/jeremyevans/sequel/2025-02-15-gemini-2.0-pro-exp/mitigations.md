# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jeremyevans/sequel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Placeholders and Dataset Methods](./mitigation_strategies/use_placeholders_and_dataset_methods.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify all user inputs:** Determine all points where data from users (or external sources) is used in database queries constructed *using Sequel*.
2.  **Replace direct string concatenation:** Wherever user input is currently being directly inserted into SQL strings *within Sequel code* (e.g., within `where`, `select`, `order`, etc.), replace it with Sequel's placeholder syntax.
3.  **Prefer symbolic placeholders:** Use the `column: value` syntax within Sequel's dataset methods (e.g., `dataset.where(username: params[:username])`).
4.  **Use `?` placeholders when necessary:** If symbolic placeholders aren't suitable, use the `?` placeholder syntax (e.g., `dataset.where("username = ?", params[:username])`).
5.  **Avoid `Sequel.lit`:** Minimize `Sequel.lit`. If unavoidable, ensure rigorous input validation *before* using it, and document the reason clearly within the Sequel-related code.
6.  **Review all Sequel query construction:**  Conduct a thorough code review to ensure that all *Sequel-based* database queries are using placeholders or Sequel's safe dataset methods.
7.  **Use Virtual Row Blocks with Placeholders:** When using Sequel's virtual row blocks, ensure user-supplied values are passed as placeholder arguments to the block, not directly embedded.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via Sequel if input is not handled correctly *within Sequel's API*.
*   **Data Disclosure (Severity: High):** Improperly constructed Sequel queries might unintentionally expose sensitive data.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: High):** Attackers could alter or delete data without authorization through manipulated Sequel queries.
*   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):** Malicious Sequel queries could overload the database.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced to near zero if implemented correctly *within Sequel*.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Significantly reduced risk.
*   **Data Modification:** Significantly reduced risk.
*   **Denial of Service:** Some reduction in risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:
    *   "User authentication queries in `models/user.rb` use Sequel placeholders."
    *   "Product search in `controllers/products_controller.rb` uses Sequel's `filter` with symbolic placeholders."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:
    *   "Legacy code in `lib/legacy_reports.rb` uses string concatenation within Sequel calls. Refactor needed."
    *   "`controllers/admin/users_controller.rb` uses `Sequel.lit` with insufficient validation within a Sequel query. Review and rewrite."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Whitelist Dynamic Table/Column Names (within Sequel)](./mitigation_strategies/whitelist_dynamic_tablecolumn_names__within_sequel_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify dynamic identifiers in Sequel calls:** Locate all instances where table or column names are determined by user input *and are used within Sequel's API*.
2.  **Create whitelists:** For each instance, create a hardcoded list of *allowed* table and column names.
3.  **Validate input before Sequel usage:** *Before* passing the user-provided table/column name to *any Sequel method*, check if it exists in the whitelist.
4.  **Handle invalid input:** If the input is not in the whitelist, reject the request. Do *not* pass the invalid input to Sequel.
5.  **Prefer symbols with Sequel:** Use symbols (e.g., `:users`, `:name`) for table and column names within Sequel calls whenever possible.
6.  **Review and document:** Document the whitelisting logic related to Sequel calls.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from accessing arbitrary tables/columns *through Sequel*.
*   **Data Disclosure (Severity: High):** Limits access to only authorized tables/columns *via Sequel*.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized modification via Sequel.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Significantly reduces risk related to dynamic identifiers *used with Sequel*.
*   **Data Disclosure/Modification:** Greatly reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:
    *   "The reporting module (`modules/reporting.rb`) uses a whitelist for allowed report types before passing them to Sequel."
    *   "Dynamic sorting in `controllers/products_controller.rb` validates the sort column before using it in a Sequel `order` call."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:
    *   "User profile editing (`controllers/users_controller.rb`) allows specifying fields to update, but this is not validated before being used in a Sequel `update` call."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid/Sanitize Raw SQL within `Sequel.[]`](./mitigation_strategies/avoidsanitize_raw_sql_within__sequel____.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Minimize raw SQL within Sequel:** Prioritize Sequel's dataset methods. Raw SQL within `Sequel.[]` or `DB.fetch` should be a last resort.
2.  **Justify and document:** If raw SQL is unavoidable *within Sequel*, clearly document the reason.
3.  **Use parameterized queries (within raw SQL):** Even within `Sequel.[]`, *always* use parameterized queries (placeholders) to handle user input. The syntax depends on the database adapter, but Sequel passes this through.
4.  **Code review:** Any code using `Sequel.[]` or `DB.fetch` should be rigorously reviewed, focusing on potential SQL injection *within the raw SQL string*.
5.  **Consider Sequel alternatives:** Explore all Sequel features before resorting to raw SQL within `Sequel.[]`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Directly addresses the highest risk associated with using raw SQL *through Sequel*.
*   **Data Disclosure (Severity: High):** Reduces risk.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: High):** Reduces risk.
*   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):** Reduces risk.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Significantly reduces risk if parameterized queries are used correctly *within the raw SQL passed to Sequel*. Eliminates risk if raw SQL within Sequel is avoided.
*   **Data Disclosure/Modification/DoS:** Similar impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:
    *   "The core application logic avoids raw SQL within Sequel calls."
    *   "A database-specific optimization in `lib/performance_tweaks.rb` uses parameterized raw SQL within `DB.fetch`, and the reason is documented."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:
    *   "Older parts of the application, in `lib/legacy`, use raw SQL within `Sequel.[]` without parameterization. Refactor needed."
    *   "No formal policy specifically addresses the use of raw SQL within Sequel calls."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization (Sequel Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization__sequel_plugins_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sequel plugin deserialization:** Determine all places where *Sequel plugins* are used to deserialize data (e.g., JSON, YAML, or custom serialization plugins).
2.  **Use safe libraries (within the plugin context):** Ensure that the *Sequel plugins* themselves, or the libraries they rely on, use secure deserialization methods.  If you're using a custom plugin, ensure *it* uses safe methods.
3.  **Validate after deserialization (by Sequel):** After Sequel (or its plugin) deserializes data, rigorously validate the resulting data structure and contents.
4.  **Consider alternatives to Sequel-based serialization:** If possible, avoid storing complex serialized data that needs to be handled by Sequel.
5.  **Keep Sequel and plugins updated:** Regularly update Sequel and all related plugins to patch vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Unsafe deserialization *by Sequel or its plugins* can lead to RCE.
*   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** Attackers could modify serialized data.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk if safe deserialization practices are followed *within the Sequel plugin context*.
*   **Data Tampering:** Reduces risk through validation after Sequel deserializes.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:
    *   "The application uses the `pg_json` Sequel extension, and we validate the data after retrieval."
    *   "Custom Sequel plugins are reviewed for safe deserialization practices."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:
    *   "The `legacy_data` column uses a custom Sequel plugin for YAML deserialization, and the plugin's safety is not verified."
    *   "There is no comprehensive validation of data deserialized by Sequel plugins in all parts of the application."
