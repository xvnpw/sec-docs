# Threat Model Analysis for jeremyevans/sequel

## Threat: [SQL Injection via String Interpolation](./threats/sql_injection_via_string_interpolation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating user-provided input that is directly embedded into a SQL query string using string interpolation. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

**Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potentially gaining control over the database server.

**Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Dataset` (when using string interpolation for query construction).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries (placeholders) with `Sequel::Dataset#where` or other query building methods.**
*   **Avoid direct string interpolation when constructing SQL queries with user input.**

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with Unsanitized Input](./threats/sql_injection_via__sequel_lit__or__sequel_expr__with_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing crafted input that is used within `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` without proper sanitization. These methods allow for raw SQL fragments, and if user input is directly included, it can lead to SQL injection.

**Impact:** Data breach, data modification or deletion, potentially gaining control over the database server.

**Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel` module (`Sequel.lit`, `Sequel.expr`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Exercise extreme caution when using `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with user-provided data.**
*   **Prefer parameterized queries whenever possible.**
*   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into raw SQL fragments.**

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Database Credentials](./threats/insecure_handling_of_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** If database connection details (username, password, host) are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the application, stored in plain text configuration files), an attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration could retrieve these credentials and compromise the database.

**Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, potential for further lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Database` (connection handling).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Store database credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools.**
*   **Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code or configuration files.**
*   **Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to protect configuration files.**

## Threat: [Exposure of Connection Strings in Logs or Error Messages](./threats/exposure_of_connection_strings_in_logs_or_error_messages.md)

**Description:** Database connection strings, which might contain credentials, could be inadvertently logged or included in error messages. An attacker accessing these logs could obtain the credentials.

**Impact:** Database compromise, data breach, data manipulation.

**Affected Sequel Component:** Logging mechanisms used in conjunction with `Sequel::Database` connection setup.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Carefully configure logging to avoid logging sensitive information like connection strings.**
*   **Sanitize or redact connection strings before logging or displaying them in error messages.**

## Threat: [Unintended Data Modification via Bulk Operations without Sufficient Filtering](./threats/unintended_data_modification_via_bulk_operations_without_sufficient_filtering.md)

**Description:** Developers might use Sequel's bulk update or delete operations without implementing sufficiently restrictive filters. An attacker, by manipulating input or exploiting vulnerabilities elsewhere, could potentially trigger these operations to modify or delete more data than intended.

**Impact:** Data corruption, data loss.

**Affected Sequel Component:** `Sequel::Dataset` (`update`, `delete` methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always carefully define the filtering conditions when using bulk update or delete operations.**
*   **Implement robust authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can trigger these operations.**
*   **Consider implementing safeguards like soft deletes or audit logging for critical bulk operations.**
