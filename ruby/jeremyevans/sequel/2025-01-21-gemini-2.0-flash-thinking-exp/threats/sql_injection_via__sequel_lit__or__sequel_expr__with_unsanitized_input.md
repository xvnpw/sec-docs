### Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with Unsanitized Input

#### Vulnerability Explanation

`Sequel.lit` and `Sequel.expr` are powerful features within the `sequel` library that allow developers to inject raw SQL fragments directly into queries. This can be useful for complex or database-specific operations that are not easily expressed using `sequel`'s query builder. However, this power comes with a significant responsibility: ensuring that any user-provided data incorporated into these raw SQL fragments is properly sanitized.

When user input is directly concatenated or interpolated into the string passed to `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` without sanitization, an attacker can craft malicious SQL code within their input. This malicious code will then be executed by the database, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**How it Works:**

*   `Sequel.lit(string)`:  Treats the provided string as a literal SQL fragment.
*   `Sequel.expr(string)`:  Similar to `Sequel.lit`, allows for the inclusion of raw SQL expressions.

If a developer uses these methods like this:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Example
username = params[:username]
users = DB[:users].where(Sequel.lit("username = '#{username}'")).all
```

An attacker could provide an input like `' OR '1'='1` for the `username` parameter. This would result in the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
```

This query bypasses the intended filtering and returns all users in the database.

#### Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code:**

```ruby
# Using Sequel.lit
def find_user_by_name_lit(username)
  DB[:users].where(Sequel.lit("username = '#{username}'")).first
end

# Using Sequel.expr
def order_users_by_column_expr(column)
  DB[:users].order(Sequel.expr(column)).all
end
```

**Secure Code (using parameterized queries):**

```ruby
# Using parameterized queries (preferred method)
def find_user_by_name_parameterized(username)
  DB[:users].where(username: username).first
end

# If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, sanitize input
def order_users_by_column_sanitized(column)
  allowed_columns = ['username', 'email', 'created_at']
  if allowed_columns.include?(column)
    DB[:users].order(Sequel.expr(column)).all
  else
    # Handle invalid input appropriately (e.g., raise an error)
    raise ArgumentError, "Invalid column for ordering"
  end
end
```

#### Attack Scenarios

1. **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could inject SQL to extract sensitive data from other tables or columns. For example, by manipulating a `WHERE` clause or using `UNION SELECT` statements.
2. **Data Modification:**  Malicious SQL could be injected to update or delete data within the database. This could involve altering user credentials, modifying financial records, or deleting critical information.
3. **Privilege Escalation:** In some database configurations, an attacker might be able to execute stored procedures or system commands with elevated privileges, potentially gaining control over the database server or even the underlying operating system.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By injecting resource-intensive queries, an attacker could overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.

**Examples of Malicious Input:**

*   For `find_user_by_name_lit`: `' OR 1=1 --` (returns all users)
*   For `find_user_by_name_lit`: `'; DROP TABLE users; --` (attempts to drop the users table)
*   For `order_users_by_column_expr`: `username; SELECT password FROM admin --` (attempts to select passwords from an admin table)

#### Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the direct inclusion of unsanitized user input into raw SQL fragments constructed using `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr`. These methods are designed to provide flexibility but inherently bypass `sequel`'s built-in mechanisms for preventing SQL injection through parameterized queries. The responsibility for ensuring the safety of the SQL generated using these methods rests entirely with the developer.

#### Mitigation Strategies (Deep Dive)

1. **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:** The most effective mitigation is to **avoid using `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with user-provided data whenever possible.**  `sequel`'s query builder provides robust and safe ways to construct queries using parameterized inputs, which automatically escape potentially malicious characters. This should be the default approach.

2. **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If the use of `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with user input is absolutely necessary (e.g., for highly dynamic queries or database-specific functions), **rigorous input validation and sanitization are crucial.** This involves:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters, patterns, or values for the input. Reject any input that does not conform to this whitelist.
    *   **Escaping:**  While `sequel`'s automatic escaping is bypassed by `Sequel.lit` and `Sequel.expr`, you can manually escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes) using database-specific escaping functions. However, this is error-prone and should be a last resort.
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure the input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string).
    *   **Length Limitations:** Impose reasonable length limits on input fields to prevent excessively long or malicious strings.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if a SQL injection vulnerability is exploited.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` are used with user input. Automated static analysis tools can also help identify potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. However, relying solely on a WAF is not sufficient and should be considered a defense-in-depth measure.

#### Detection Strategies

1. **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools that can identify instances where `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` are used with potentially unsanitized user input.
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools or manual penetration testing techniques to simulate SQL injection attacks by injecting various malicious payloads into input fields that are used with `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr`.
3. **Code Reviews:**  Manual code reviews by security-aware developers can effectively identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. **Security Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious database activity that might indicate a successful or attempted SQL injection attack. Look for unusual query patterns, error messages, or unauthorized data access.

#### Prevention Best Practices

*   **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with using `Sequel.lit` and `Sequel.expr` with unsanitized input and understand secure coding practices for preventing SQL injection.
*   **Adopt a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security considerations throughout the entire development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
*   **Use Security Linters:** Integrate security linters into the development workflow to automatically identify potential security flaws, including risky uses of `Sequel.lit` and `Sequel.expr`.
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `sequel` library and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

### Conclusion

SQL injection via `Sequel.lit` or `Sequel.expr` with unsanitized input represents a critical security threat to applications using the `sequel` library. While these methods offer flexibility, they require extreme caution and a deep understanding of the potential risks. By prioritizing parameterized queries, implementing strict input validation, and adhering to secure coding practices, development teams can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect their applications and data from malicious attacks. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are essential to ensure the continued security of the application.
