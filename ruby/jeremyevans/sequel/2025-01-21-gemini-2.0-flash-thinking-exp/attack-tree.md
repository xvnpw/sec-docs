## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- This path represents the classic and still prevalent threat of SQL Injection. Attackers aim to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

  - Inject SQL via User-Controlled Input in `where` clause (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are directly used in the `where` clause of Sequel queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
      - Leverage unsanitized input in `where` conditions (e.g., `params[:search]`): The application directly uses user-provided input (e.g., from a search bar) in the `where` clause without sanitizing or parameterizing it.
      - Bypass input validation or sanitization mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers find ways to circumvent the application's input validation or sanitization attempts, allowing malicious SQL to reach the database.

  - Inject SQL via User-Controlled Input in `insert` or `update` statements (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into data being inserted or updated in the database. This can lead to data corruption, the insertion of malicious code, or privilege escalation.
      - Provide malicious data for insertion or update operations: The application accepts user-provided data for insertion or update operations without proper validation or escaping.
      - Exploit lack of proper parameterization or escaping (CRITICAL NODE): The application fails to use parameterized queries or proper escaping mechanisms when constructing `insert` or `update` statements with user-provided data.

  - Inject SQL via User-Controlled Input in raw SQL queries (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: When developers use Sequel's ability to execute raw SQL queries, they might directly embed unsanitized user input into these queries, creating a direct SQL injection vulnerability.
      - Directly execute raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input: The application uses `Sequel.db.execute` or similar methods with raw SQL strings that include user-provided data without proper sanitization.

  - Exploit Second-Order SQL Injection:
    - Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into the database through one entry point. This malicious code lies dormant until it is later retrieved and used in a vulnerable SQL query elsewhere in the application.
      - Inject malicious data into the database that is later used in a vulnerable Sequel query: The attacker injects malicious data that is stored in the database.
      - This data is later retrieved and used in a vulnerable Sequel query: A subsequent query, perhaps in a different part of the application, retrieves this malicious data and uses it unsafely, leading to SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sequel's Database Connection Handling (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sequel's_database_connection_handling__critical_node_.md)

- This path focuses on compromising the application's connection to the database. If an attacker can manipulate the connection or gain access to credentials, they can directly interact with the database.

  - Inject Malicious Connection Parameters (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to manipulate the database connection string or parameters used by Sequel. This could involve redirecting the application to a malicious database server under the attacker's control.
      - Manipulate connection strings or parameters to connect to a malicious database: The application allows user-controlled input to influence the database connection parameters.
      - Exploit insecure storage or handling of database credentials (CRITICAL NODE): Database credentials (usernames, passwords) are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, in easily accessible configuration files) allowing attackers to retrieve them and use them to connect directly to the database.
