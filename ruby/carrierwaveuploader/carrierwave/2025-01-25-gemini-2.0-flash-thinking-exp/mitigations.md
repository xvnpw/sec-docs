# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Type Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/file_type_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Open your Carrierwave uploader definition file (e.g., `app/uploaders/my_uploader.rb`).
    2.  Define or modify the `extension_whitelist` method within the uploader class.
    3.  Specify allowed file extensions as an array of strings (e.g., `['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'pdf']`).
    4.  Optionally, define or modify the `content_type_whitelist` method for MIME type validation, listing allowed MIME types (e.g., `['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf']`).
    5.  Test by attempting to upload files with disallowed extensions and content types to ensure validation is enforced by Carrierwave.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unrestricted File Type Uploads - High Severity (Remote Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting, Server-Side vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unrestricted File Type Uploads - High Impact (Significantly reduces the risk of malicious file uploads by leveraging Carrierwave's built-in validation)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented for profile picture uploads in `app/uploaders/profile_picture_uploader.rb`, allowing `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `png`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not yet implemented for document uploads in `app/uploaders/document_uploader.rb`. Needs to be implemented in Carrierwave uploader to restrict document types to `pdf` and `docx`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Magic Number Validation (within Carrierwave Uploader)](./mitigation_strategies/magic_number_validation__within_carrierwave_uploader_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Add a gem like `filemagic` or `mimemagic` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.
    2.  In your Carrierwave uploader, define a `validate_integrity!` method.
    3.  Inside `validate_integrity!`, use the chosen gem to inspect the file's magic number (file signature) within the Carrierwave uploader context.
    4.  Compare the detected MIME type from magic number analysis against your allowed MIME types.
    5.  Add an error to Carrierwave's `errors` object if the magic number doesn't match an allowed type, triggering Carrierwave's validation failure.
    6.  Test by uploading files with correct extensions but manipulated content or incorrect magic numbers to verify Carrierwave validation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unrestricted File Type Uploads - High Severity (Circumvention of extension-based whitelisting, leading to RCE, XSS, by enhancing Carrierwave's validation)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unrestricted File Type Uploads - High Impact (Further strengthens file type validation within Carrierwave, making it harder to bypass)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented in any Carrierwave uploaders.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs to be implemented for all Carrierwave uploaders, especially those handling file types with higher security risks like documents or archives, by adding custom validation logic within Carrierwave.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Size Limits in Carrierwave](./mitigation_strategies/file_size_limits_in_carrierwave.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Open your Carrierwave uploader definition file.
    2.  Define or modify the `size_range` method within the uploader class in Carrierwave.
    3.  Specify the allowed file size range using Ruby ranges (e.g., `0..5.megabytes` for a maximum of 5MB) within Carrierwave's configuration.
    4.  Test by attempting to upload files exceeding the defined size limit to ensure Carrierwave enforces the limit.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unrestricted File Size Uploads - Medium Severity (Denial of Service, Resource Exhaustion)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unrestricted File Size Uploads - Medium Impact (Reduces the risk of DoS attacks via large file uploads by utilizing Carrierwave's size restriction feature)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented for profile picture uploads in `app/uploaders/profile_picture_uploader.rb`, limiting to 2MB using Carrierwave's `size_range`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not yet implemented for document uploads in `app/uploaders/document_uploader.rb`. Needs to be implemented in Carrierwave with a reasonable limit for document files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Generate Unique and Unpredictable Filenames (using Carrierwave defaults or customization)](./mitigation_strategies/generate_unique_and_unpredictable_filenames__using_carrierwave_defaults_or_customization_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Rely on Carrierwave's default filename generation, which uses timestamps and random strings, ensuring unique filenames are generated by Carrierwave.
    2.  If customizing filenames within Carrierwave's `filename` method, ensure you use a secure random number generator (e.g., `SecureRandom.uuid`, `SecureRandom.hex`) to create unique identifiers within the Carrierwave uploader.
    3.  Avoid using user-provided input directly in filenames within Carrierwave without sanitization and unique identifier generation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   File Naming and Path Traversal Vulnerabilities - Medium Severity (File Overwriting, Path Traversal, Information Disclosure)
*   **Impact:**
    *   File Naming and Path Traversal Vulnerabilities - Medium Impact (Reduces the risk of predictable filenames and path manipulation by leveraging Carrierwave's filename handling)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented by default in all Carrierwave uploaders as no custom filename logic is in place, relying on Carrierwave's default behavior.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation, but should be continuously reviewed if custom filename logic is introduced in Carrierwave uploaders in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Filenames (within Carrierwave Uploader)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_filenames__within_carrierwave_uploader_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If you must incorporate user-provided parts in filenames within Carrierwave, implement a sanitization function.
    2.  This function, applied within Carrierwave's `filename` method, should remove or replace potentially harmful characters like `../`, `./`, backslashes, spaces, and special characters.
    3.  Apply this sanitization function within your uploader's `filename` method if you are overriding it in Carrierwave.
    4.  Test by uploading files with filenames containing potentially harmful characters and path separators to verify Carrierwave's filename handling.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   File Naming and Path Traversal Vulnerabilities - Medium Severity (Path Traversal, File Overwriting)
*   **Impact:**
    *   File Naming and Path Traversal Vulnerabilities - Medium Impact (Reduces the risk of path traversal through filename manipulation by customizing Carrierwave's filename logic)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented as filenames are mostly auto-generated by Carrierwave.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Should be implemented within Carrierwave uploaders if there's a requirement to use user-provided names or parts of names in filenames in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Antivirus/Malware Scanning (Integrated with Carrierwave Processing)](./mitigation_strategies/antivirusmalware_scanning__integrated_with_carrierwave_processing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose an antivirus/malware scanning solution (e.g., ClamAV, cloud-based API).
    2.  Integrate the scanning process into your application, ideally within a Carrierwave processing step using `process` in the uploader.
    3.  Implement a Carrierwave processor that will:
        *   Receive the uploaded file path from Carrierwave.
        *   Send the file to the scanning service.
        *   Parse the scan results.
        *   If malware is detected, raise an error within the Carrierwave processor to reject the upload and prevent Carrierwave from storing the file.
    4.  Test by uploading known malware samples (use test samples, not live malware) to ensure Carrierwave processing and validation reject malicious files.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   File Content Security and Malware - High Severity (Server compromise, serving malware to users, data breaches)
*   **Impact:**
    *   File Content Security and Malware - High Impact (Significantly reduces the risk of malware infections via file uploads by extending Carrierwave's processing capabilities)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs to be implemented for all file upload functionalities using Carrierwave, especially for document uploads which are more likely to carry malware, by creating a custom Carrierwave processor.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strip Metadata (using Carrierwave Processing)](./mitigation_strategies/strip_metadata__using_carrierwave_processing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Add an image processing gem like `mini_magick` or `ruby-vips` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.
    2.  In your Carrierwave uploader for images (and potentially documents), define a processing step to strip metadata using Carrierwave's `process` functionality.
    3.  Use the chosen gem's functionality within a Carrierwave processor to remove EXIF data from images and metadata from documents.
    4.  Apply this processing step using `process` in your uploader definition in Carrierwave.
    5.  Test by uploading files with metadata and verifying that the processed files, handled by Carrierwave, have metadata removed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Metadata Exploitation - Low Severity (Information Disclosure - potentially sensitive user or location data)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Metadata Exploitation - Low Impact (Reduces the risk of unintentional information disclosure through file metadata by leveraging Carrierwave's processing pipeline)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs to be implemented for image uploads in `app/uploaders/profile_picture_uploader.rb` and potentially for document uploads in `app/uploaders/document_uploader.rb` by adding a metadata stripping processor to Carrierwave.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Carrierwave and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_carrierwave_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Use Bundler to manage dependencies, including Carrierwave.
    2.  Regularly run `bundle outdated` to check for outdated gems, including Carrierwave and its dependencies.
    3.  Update Carrierwave and its dependencies to the latest versions by running `bundle update carrierwave` and `bundle update <other_outdated_gem>`.
    4.  Monitor security advisories specifically for Carrierwave and its ecosystem (e.g., via GitHub, RubySec).
    5.  Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning in your CI/CD pipeline to specifically check for vulnerabilities in Carrierwave and its dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - Variable Severity (Depending on the vulnerability in Carrierwave or its dependencies, can range from Low to High - RCE, XSS, etc.)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - Variable Impact (Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in Carrierwave and its dependencies)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Regular dependency updates are part of the development process, but not strictly scheduled for Carrierwave specifically.
    *   No automated vulnerability scanning is currently in place that specifically targets Carrierwave dependencies.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement a scheduled dependency update process (e.g., monthly) that includes specific checks and updates for Carrierwave.
    *   Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring it covers Carrierwave and its dependencies.
