## Attack Tree Path: [🔥💥 Exploit Upload Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/🔥💥_exploit_upload_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities during the file upload process. Attackers target weaknesses in how the application handles uploaded files, aiming to introduce malicious content or bypass security checks.

* **🔥📤 Upload Malicious File (Critical Node):** This critical node represents the direct attempt to upload harmful files.
    * **🔥🦠 Upload Virus/Malware:** Attackers upload files containing viruses or malware with the intent to infect the server or other systems.
    * **🔥💣 Upload Exploit Payload:** Attackers upload files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application or underlying system.
* **🔥✅ Bypass Server-Side Validation (Critical Node):** This critical node highlights the failure of server-side validation, a fundamental security control.
    * **🔥📏 Exploit Inadequate Size Limits:** Attackers upload excessively large files to cause denial of service or resource exhaustion.
    * **🔥📂 Exploit Inadequate File Type Restrictions:** Attackers upload files with dangerous extensions or MIME types that are not properly restricted, potentially leading to code execution if served incorrectly.
    * **🔥📝 Exploit Inadequate Filename Sanitization:** Attackers manipulate filenames to perform malicious actions.
        * **🔥🔤 Filename Injection (e.g., path traversal "../", command injection via filename):** Attackers craft filenames to navigate the file system (path traversal) or inject commands that could be executed by the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [🔥💾 Exploit Storage Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/🔥💾_exploit_storage_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path targets vulnerabilities in how and where uploaded files are stored. Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to stored files or manipulate the storage mechanisms.

* **🔥🔓 Direct Access to Storage Location (Critical Node):** This critical node represents the ability of attackers to directly access the storage location of uploaded files without proper authorization.
    * **🔥🔑 Guessable/Predictable Storage Paths:** Attackers exploit predictable naming conventions or easily guessable paths to access stored files.
    * **🔥📜 Insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Cloud Storage (e.g., S3 buckets):** Attackers exploit overly permissive or misconfigured ACLs on cloud storage services to access files.

## Attack Tree Path: [🔥🌐 Exploit File Serving (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/🔥🌐_exploit_file_serving__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities when the application serves the uploaded files to users. Attackers aim to access unauthorized files or manipulate the serving process for malicious purposes.

* **🔥🛤️ Path Traversal during File Serving (Critical Node):** This critical node represents the ability of attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and access arbitrary files on the server by manipulating file paths during the serving process.

## Attack Tree Path: [🔥⚙️ Exploit Processing (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/🔥⚙️_exploit_processing__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path targets vulnerabilities that arise when CarrierWave or other libraries process the uploaded files. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in these processing mechanisms.

* **🔥🛠️ Vulnerabilities in Processing Libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, LibreOffice) (Critical Node):** This critical node highlights the risk of using vulnerable processing libraries.
    * **🔥💣 Trigger Vulnerable Processing Functionality with Malicious File:** Attackers upload specially crafted files that trigger known vulnerabilities in processing libraries, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [🛠️ Exploit CarrierWave Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/🛠️_exploit_carrierwave_configuration.md)

While the top level is not marked as high-risk, specific misconfigurations represent critical points of failure.

* **🔥⚙️ Misconfigured Storage Options (Critical Node):** Incorrectly configured storage options (local, cloud) can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **🔥🔑 Leaked Storage Credentials (Critical Node):** If storage credentials are leaked, attackers have direct and unfettered access to all stored files.
