# Detailed Analysis: Path Traversal via Filename in CarrierWave

## Threat: Path Traversal via Filename

**Description:**

This threat focuses on the potential for attackers to manipulate filenames during the file upload process, leveraging path traversal sequences (like `../`) to write files outside the intended upload directory managed by CarrierWave. This occurs when the application, or CarrierWave itself, doesn't adequately sanitize or validate the filename provided by the user.

**Deep Dive into the Mechanism:**

1. **User-Controlled Input:** The attacker's primary point of interaction is the filename field during the file upload. This field is often directly passed to CarrierWave.

2. **Exploiting Path Traversal:** By crafting a filename like `../../../../tmp/evil.php`, the attacker aims to instruct the operating system to navigate upwards in the directory structure before writing the file.

3. **CarrierWave's Role:** CarrierWave takes the uploaded file and its associated metadata, including the filename. Its responsibility is to store this file securely. The vulnerability arises if CarrierWave trusts the provided filename implicitly or if its sanitization logic is insufficient.

4. **File System Interaction:** When CarrierWave attempts to save the file, it constructs a path based on its configuration and the (potentially malicious) filename. If the sanitization is weak, the operating system interprets the `../` sequences, allowing the write operation to occur outside the designated upload directory.

**Impact Breakdown:**

* **Arbitrary File Write (Critical):** This is the most direct and dangerous impact.
    * **Overwriting Existing Files:** Attackers can overwrite critical system files, configuration files (e.g., database credentials, API keys), or even application code.
    * **Uploading Malicious Code:** The ability to write arbitrary files allows attackers to upload and potentially execute malicious scripts (e.g., PHP webshells, Python backdoors) in locations accessible by the web server.
    * **Data Tampering:** Attackers could overwrite legitimate data files, leading to data corruption or manipulation.

* **Arbitrary File Read (Secondary, but Possible):** While the primary attack vector is writing, in some scenarios, the attacker might be able to infer the existence or even content of files outside the upload directory through error messages or by strategically placing files and observing the application's behavior.

* **Code Execution (High Probability):**  Successfully writing a malicious script to a web-accessible directory almost immediately translates to code execution on the server. This grants the attacker significant control over the system.

* **Data Breaches (High Probability):** Code execution can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data, access databases, or compromise other connected systems. Overwriting configuration files can also directly lead to data breaches.

* **Denial of Service (Possible):** Overwriting critical system files or filling up disk space with malicious uploads could lead to a denial of service.

**Affected Component Analysis: `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile`**

* **Role of `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile`:** This class within CarrierWave is responsible for taking the uploaded file and its original filename and preparing it for storage. Crucially, it includes logic for sanitizing the filename to make it safe for the filesystem.

* **Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability lies in the effectiveness of the sanitization logic within `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile`. If the sanitization rules are too basic or don't account for all possible path traversal techniques, attackers can bypass them.

* **Default Sanitization:** CarrierWave's default sanitization typically removes or replaces characters considered unsafe for filenames on various operating systems (e.g., spaces, forward slashes, backslashes, colons, etc.). However, it might not aggressively handle sequences like `../` by default.

* **Customization Potential:** CarrierWave allows developers to customize the filename sanitization process using the `sanitize_regexp` option. This is a key area for mitigation.

**Risk Severity Justification (Critical):**

The "Critical" severity is justified due to:

* **High Likelihood of Exploitation:** Path traversal vulnerabilities are relatively easy to understand and exploit.
* **Severe Impact:** The potential for arbitrary file write and subsequent code execution makes this a highly damaging vulnerability.
* **Direct Access to Server:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker direct access to the server's filesystem.

**Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Utilize CarrierWave's Built-in Filename Sanitization Features:**

    * **`sanitize_regexp` Configuration:** This is the primary mechanism within CarrierWave for controlling filename sanitization.
    * **Recommendation:**  **Do not rely solely on the default sanitization.**  Implement a robust regular expression that explicitly removes or replaces sequences like `\.{2,}` (two or more consecutive dots), leading dots (`^\.`), and trailing dots (`\.$`).
    * **Example `sanitize_regexp` (Ruby):**
        ```ruby
        class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
          # ... other configurations ...

          def filename
            if original_filename
              @name ||= Digest::MD5.hexdigest(File.dirname(current_path))
              "#{Time.now.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")}-#{@name}#{File.extname(original_filename)}"
            end
          end

          configure do |config|
            config.remove_previously_stored_files_after_update = false
            config.filename_sanitizer = lambda { |filename|
              # For security reasons, you might want to be very restrictive
              filename.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\.\-\_]/, '') # Allow only alphanumeric, dot, hyphen, underscore
            }
          end
        end
        ```
    * **Caution:**  Test your regular expression thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., accidentally removing valid parts of filenames).

2. **Avoid Relying on User-Provided Filenames Directly:**

    * **Server-Side Filename Generation:** The most secure approach is to generate unique and safe filenames on the server-side, completely discarding the user-provided filename for storage purposes.
    * **Methods:**
        * **UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers):** Generate a random UUID for each uploaded file.
        * **Timestamps:** Use a timestamp combined with a random string or hash.
        * **Hashing:** Hash the file content or parts of it to create a unique identifier.
    * **Implementation (Override `filename` method):**
        ```ruby
        class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
          # ... other configurations ...

          def filename
            "#{SecureRandom.uuid}#{File.extname(original_filename)}" if original_filename
          end
        end
        ```
    * **Benefits:** This eliminates the possibility of path traversal via filename as the attacker has no control over the stored filename.

3. **Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Filenames Before Saving:**

    * **Defense in Depth:** Even with CarrierWave's sanitization, adding an extra layer of validation before CarrierWave processes the file is crucial.
    * **Validation Steps:**
        * **Explicitly Check for Path Traversal Sequences:** Use regular expressions or string manipulation to detect `../`, `./`, `.\`, etc.
        * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a strict set of allowed characters for filenames and reject any filename containing characters outside this set. This is generally more secure than blacklisting.
        * **Filename Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable length limits to prevent excessively long or crafted filenames.
    * **Example (Conceptual - within your application logic before calling CarrierWave):**
        ```python
        import os

        def is_filename_safe(filename):
            # Check for path traversal sequences
            if ".." in filename or "./" in filename or ".\\" in filename:
                return False
            # Whitelist allowed characters (example)
            allowed_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789._-"
            for char in filename:
                if char not in allowed_chars:
                    return False
            return True

        uploaded_file = request.files['file']
        original_filename = uploaded_file.filename

        if not is_filename_safe(original_filename):
            # Handle invalid filename (e.g., reject upload, log error)
            print("Error: Invalid filename detected.")
        else:
            # Proceed with CarrierWave upload
            # ...
            pass
        ```

**Further Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on file upload handling and filename sanitization.
* **Security Testing:** Implement automated security tests to check for path traversal vulnerabilities in file upload endpoints.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to perform penetration testing and identify potential weaknesses.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server process has the minimum necessary permissions to write to the upload directory and no more. This limits the potential damage if a path traversal attack is successful.
* **Secure File Storage:** Consider storing uploaded files outside the web server's document root to further mitigate the risk of direct access.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct solution to path traversal, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of uploaded malicious content.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep CarrierWave and other dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.

**Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal via Filename" threat is a critical vulnerability that requires careful attention. By understanding the mechanics of the attack and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on robust server-side filename generation and thorough input validation, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect the application from potential data breaches and code execution. A defense-in-depth approach, combining CarrierWave's features with application-level validation, is essential for a secure file upload implementation.
