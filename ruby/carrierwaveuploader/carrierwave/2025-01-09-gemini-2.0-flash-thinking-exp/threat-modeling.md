# Threat Model Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Type Upload / Malicious File Upload (Bypassing Whitelists)](./threats/unrestricted_file_type_upload__malicious_file_upload__bypassing_whitelists_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads files with malicious content (e.g., web shells, malware, scripts) by either manipulating the file extension or MIME type to bypass client-side or weak server-side validation configured within CarrierWave. They might aim to execute arbitrary code on the server or compromise other users.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, cross-site scripting (if the uploaded file is served), defacement, data theft.
*   **Affected Component:** `CarrierWave::Uploader::MimeTypes`, `CarrierWave::Uploader::ExtensionWhitelist`, `CarrierWave::Uploader::ExtensionBlacklist` modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a strong whitelist approach for allowed file extensions and MIME types in your CarrierWave uploader.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side validation.
    *   Implement server-side validation that checks both file extension and MIME type within the CarrierWave configuration.
    *   Consider using libraries that perform deeper content analysis (magic number checks) to verify file types, potentially integrated within a CarrierWave processor.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and serve them through application logic with appropriate headers (e.g., `Content-Disposition: attachment`).
    *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files, potentially integrating a scanner within a CarrierWave callback or processor.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Filename](./threats/path_traversal_via_filename.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../../evil.php`) during the upload process handled by CarrierWave. This could allow them to overwrite or access files outside the intended upload directory managed by CarrierWave.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read or write on the server, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile`, specifically the filename sanitization logic within CarrierWave's file handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize CarrierWave's built-in filename sanitization features.
    *   Avoid relying on user-provided filenames directly within your CarrierWave configuration. Generate unique and safe filenames server-side using CarrierWave's mechanisms.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for filenames before saving, ensuring CarrierWave's sanitization is effective.

## Threat: [Publicly Accessible Private Files (Misconfigured Storage Backend)](./threats/publicly_accessible_private_files__misconfigured_storage_backend_.md)

*   **Description:** The chosen storage backend configured within CarrierWave (e.g., local filesystem, cloud storage like AWS S3) is misconfigured, making uploaded files intended to be private publicly accessible. This occurs due to incorrect settings when configuring CarrierWave's storage.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained in the uploaded files managed by CarrierWave.
*   **Affected Component:** `CarrierWave::Storage::Abstract`, and the specific storage implementation configured in CarrierWave (e.g., `CarrierWave::Storage::File`, `CarrierWave::Storage::Fog`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure access control settings for your storage backend as specified in CarrierWave's documentation and the backend's documentation.
    *   For cloud storage configured with CarrierWave, use private buckets and generate signed URLs for authorized access, ensuring CarrierWave is used to generate these URLs securely.
    *   For local storage configured with CarrierWave, ensure files are stored outside the web server's public directory and served through application logic with authorization checks, not directly through the web server.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Processing Libraries (e.g., ImageTragick)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_processing_libraries__e_g___imagetragick_.md)

*   **Description:** CarrierWave often uses external libraries (e.g., MiniMagick, RMagick) for image processing. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by uploading specially crafted files, leading to remote code execution on the server during CarrierWave's processing steps.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `CarrierWave::MiniMagick`, `CarrierWave::RMagick`, or other processing libraries integrated with CarrierWave through processor definitions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all processing libraries used by CarrierWave up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Consider using sandboxed environments or containerization for file processing initiated by CarrierWave.
    *   Validate and sanitize user-provided input used in processing commands within CarrierWave processors.

## Threat: [Insecure File Processing Logic](./threats/insecure_file_processing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Custom file processing logic implemented within CarrierWave uploaders might contain vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection if external commands are executed based on file content within a CarrierWave processor).
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom processors defined within the CarrierWave uploader.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test any custom file processing code within CarrierWave uploaders.
    *   Avoid executing external commands based on user-provided file content without proper sanitization within CarrierWave processors.
    *   Use parameterized commands or safe APIs for file manipulation within CarrierWave processors.
