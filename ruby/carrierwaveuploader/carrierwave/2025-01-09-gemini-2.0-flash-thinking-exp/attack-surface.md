# Attack Surface Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Attack Surface: [Inadequate File Type Validation](./attack_surfaces/inadequate_file_type_validation.md)

**Description:** The application fails to properly validate the type of uploaded files, allowing users to upload files with unexpected or malicious content.

**How CarrierWave Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CarrierWave provides mechanisms for defining allowed file types (whitelists) and disallowed file types (blacklists). If these lists are not comprehensive or are incorrectly implemented, malicious file types can bypass the validation. Developers might rely on client-side validation or weak server-side checks.

**Example:** A user uploads a `.php` file disguised as a `.jpg` image by manipulating the extension or MIME type, and the server executes this file, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side file type validation using allowlists based on file extensions and, more importantly, MIME type inspection of the file's content (magic numbers).
*   Avoid relying solely on client-side validation, as it can be easily bypassed.
*   Regularly review and update the list of allowed file types.
*   Consider using libraries that provide more sophisticated file type detection.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Filename Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_filename_sanitization.md)

**Description:** The application does not properly sanitize uploaded filenames, allowing attackers to inject malicious characters.

**How CarrierWave Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CarrierWave allows developers to customize how filenames are stored. If the application doesn't sanitize filenames before saving them, attackers can use characters like `../` for path traversal, potentially overwriting or accessing unintended files.

**Example:** A user uploads a file named `../../config/database.yml`. If not sanitized, this could lead to overwriting the application's database configuration file.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize filenames by removing or replacing potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `../`, `<`, `>`, `&`, quotes, spaces, non-alphanumeric characters).
*   Use CarrierWave's built-in filename processing options or implement custom sanitization logic.
*   Consider generating unique, non-user-controlled filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Storage Location](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_storage_location.md)

**Description:** Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible location without proper access controls.

**How CarrierWave Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CarrierWave allows configuration of the storage location (e.g., local filesystem, cloud storage). If the chosen location is publicly accessible by default (e.g., an improperly configured S3 bucket) or if the application doesn't implement access controls, sensitive uploaded files can be exposed.

**Example:** Users upload personal documents, and these files are stored in a publicly readable S3 bucket, allowing anyone with the URL to access them.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that the storage location for uploaded files is not publicly accessible by default.
*   Implement proper access controls at the storage level (e.g., bucket policies, access control lists).
*   Serve uploaded files through the application, allowing for authentication and authorization checks before serving.
*   Use signed URLs for temporary access to private files.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in File Processing Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_file_processing_libraries.md)

**Description:** The application uses external libraries (e.g., MiniMagick, RMagick) for processing uploaded files, and these libraries have known vulnerabilities.

**How CarrierWave Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CarrierWave often integrates with image processing libraries for tasks like resizing or manipulating images. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, attackers can craft malicious input files that exploit these flaws, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.

**Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in MiniMagick, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep all dependencies, including CarrierWave and its processing libraries, up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using safer alternatives or sandboxing techniques for file processing.
*   Implement input validation even for files intended for processing, to catch potentially malicious files early.
