# Deep Analysis: Directory Traversal Attack Surface in CarrierWave

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the directory traversal vulnerability associated with the CarrierWave gem, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and propose robust, practical mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their applications against this threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on directory traversal vulnerabilities arising from the use of the CarrierWave gem in Ruby on Rails applications (or other Ruby frameworks).  It covers:

*   CarrierWave's `store_dir` configuration and its interaction with user-supplied filenames.
*   The effectiveness of CarrierWave's built-in filename sanitization.
*   The interplay between CarrierWave, the web server, and the underlying operating system's file permissions.
*   Edge cases and potential bypasses of common mitigation techniques.
*   Integration with other security best practices.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General file upload vulnerabilities unrelated to CarrierWave (e.g., MIME type spoofing, unless directly relevant to directory traversal).
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that are not directly related to file uploads handled by CarrierWave.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying web server or operating system itself, except where they directly exacerbate the CarrierWave directory traversal risk.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the CarrierWave source code (specifically the `lib/carrierwave/uploader/store.rb` and related files) to understand how `store_dir` is handled and how filenames are processed.  We will also review relevant parts of the Rails framework that interact with CarrierWave.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known CarrierWave vulnerabilities and exploits related to directory traversal, including CVEs and public disclosures.
3.  **Penetration Testing (Hypothetical):** We will describe hypothetical penetration testing scenarios to illustrate how an attacker might attempt to exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities in a CarrierWave-based application.  We will *not* perform actual penetration testing on a live system as part of this document.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:** We will analyze industry best practices for secure file uploads and directory management, and map them to CarrierWave-specific recommendations.
5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack vectors and assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploits.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. `store_dir` Configuration: The Core Vulnerability

The `store_dir` method in a CarrierWave uploader class determines where uploaded files are stored.  The most critical vulnerability arises when `store_dir` is improperly configured to allow user input to influence the final storage path.

**Vulnerable Example:**

```ruby
class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{params[:user_id]}/#{model.id}"  # DANGEROUS: Uses params directly!
  end
end
```

In this example, an attacker could manipulate the `user_id` parameter to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../tmp`).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Indirect User Input:**  Even if `params` is not used *directly*, any user-controlled data (e.g., database fields, session data) used to construct the `store_dir` path is a potential vulnerability.
*   **Default `store_dir`:**  The default `store_dir` in CarrierWave is usually `public/uploads`.  While this is generally safe *if* the web server is configured correctly (to serve files from `public`), it's still best practice to move uploads outside the web root.
*   **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:**  `store_dir` should *always* return a path *relative* to a pre-defined, secure root directory.  Never allow `store_dir` to return an absolute path, as this bypasses any root directory restrictions.

### 2.2. Filename Sanitization: A Layer of Defense (But Not Foolproof)

CarrierWave includes built-in filename sanitization to remove potentially dangerous characters and sequences.  This sanitization is crucial, but it's not a silver bullet.

**How Sanitization Works (Generally):**

CarrierWave typically uses a regular expression to replace or remove characters like `/`, `\`, `..`, and control characters.  The exact regular expression may vary between versions.

**Potential Bypass Techniques:**

*   **Unicode Normalization Issues:**  Attackers might use Unicode characters that, after normalization, become directory traversal sequences.  For example, a full-width slash (`\uff0f`) might normalize to a regular slash (`/`).
*   **Double Encoding:**  Attackers might double-encode characters (e.g., `%252e%252e%252f` for `../`) to bypass simple sanitization routines.
*   **Null Bytes:**  In some cases, injecting null bytes (`%00`) can truncate filenames and bypass sanitization.
*   **Race Conditions:**  If the filename is checked and then used later in a separate operation, a race condition might allow an attacker to modify the filename between the check and the use.
*   **Bugs in Sanitization Logic:**  There's always the possibility of bugs in the sanitization regular expression or logic itself, allowing attackers to craft payloads that bypass the intended protections.

**Example (Hypothetical Bypass):**

An attacker might try uploading a file named `%EF%BC%8E%EF%BC%8E%EF%BC%8Fetc%EF%BC%8Fpasswd`.  This uses full-width Unicode characters that *might* normalize to `../etc/passwd` after sanitization, depending on the specific normalization rules and CarrierWave version.

### 2.3. Operating System Permissions: The Last Line of Defense

Even if an attacker manages to manipulate the filename and `store_dir`, the operating system's file permissions can prevent them from overwriting critical system files.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The web server process (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Puma) should have *only* the necessary permissions to write to the designated upload directory.  It should *not* have write access to any other directories, especially system directories like `/etc`, `/bin`, or `/usr`.
*   **Dedicated Upload Directory:**  The upload directory should be a dedicated directory, separate from the web root and other application files.
*   **Ownership and Group Permissions:**  Carefully configure the ownership and group permissions of the upload directory to restrict access appropriately.
*   **SELinux/AppArmor:**  Consider using mandatory access control systems like SELinux (on Linux) or AppArmor to further restrict the web server's capabilities, even if it's compromised.

**Example (Insecure Permissions):**

If the web server process runs as the `root` user (which is *highly* discouraged), it would have write access to the entire filesystem, making directory traversal attacks extremely dangerous.

**Example (Secure Permissions):**

*   Upload directory: `/var/www/myapp/uploads`
*   Web server user: `www-data`
*   Permissions: `drwxr-xr-x  www-data www-data /var/www/myapp/uploads` (owner can read, write, execute; group can read and execute; others can read and execute)
*   Files within uploads: `-rw-r--r--  www-data www-data ...` (owner can read and write; group can read; others can read)

### 2.4. Interaction with Other Security Measures

*   **Input Validation:**  While not directly related to `store_dir`, validating *all* user input is crucial.  This includes validating file types, sizes, and any metadata associated with the upload.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block directory traversal attempts by inspecting HTTP requests for suspicious patterns.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  An IDS can monitor system activity for signs of compromise, including unauthorized file access.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

### 2.5. Threat Modeling

**Threat Actor:**  A malicious external user or an internal user with compromised credentials.

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker submits a crafted filename containing directory traversal sequences through a file upload form.

**Likelihood:**  High, if `store_dir` is improperly configured or filename sanitization is bypassed.

**Impact:**  High.  Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **System File Corruption:**  Overwriting critical system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files) can render the system unusable or allow the attacker to gain control.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker might be able to overwrite files used by privileged processes, allowing them to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Overwriting essential files can cause the application or the entire system to crash.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** While the primary focus is on writing files, directory traversal can sometimes be used to *read* files outside the intended directory, leading to data leakage.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

1.  **Secure `store_dir` Implementation:**

    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Instead of trying to sanitize user input, use a whitelist approach to define the allowed directory structure.  For example:

        ```ruby
        def store_dir
          "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{model.id}"  # Safe: Uses model attributes, not user input.
        end
        ```
        Or, even more restrictively:
        ```ruby
        def store_dir
          "uploads/user_avatars/#{model.id % 100}" # Buckets users into subdirectories
        end
        ```

    *   **Avoid User Input:**  Never use `params`, session data, or any other user-controlled data directly or indirectly in `store_dir`.

    *   **Relative Paths Only:**  Ensure `store_dir` always returns a path *relative* to a secure root directory.  You can configure this root directory in CarrierWave's configuration:

        ```ruby
        CarrierWave.configure do |config|
          config.root = Rails.root.join('storage') # 'storage' is outside the 'public' directory
        end
        ```

    *   **Test Thoroughly:**  Write unit tests and integration tests to specifically verify that `store_dir` returns the expected paths and that directory traversal attempts are blocked.

2.  **Enhanced Filename Sanitization:**

    *   **Review CarrierWave's Sanitization:**  Understand the specific sanitization rules used by your version of CarrierWave.  Check the source code and documentation.
    *   **Custom Sanitization (If Necessary):**  If you have specific security requirements or are concerned about potential bypasses, you can implement custom sanitization *in addition to* CarrierWave's built-in sanitization.  This can be done in a `before_save` callback or by overriding the `sanitize_regexp` method in your uploader.  Be *extremely* careful when writing custom sanitization logic, as errors can introduce new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Randomization:** Instead of relying solely on sanitization, consider generating a random filename for the uploaded file and storing the original filename separately (e.g., in a database). This eliminates the risk of directory traversal based on the filename.

        ```ruby
        def filename
          @filename ||= "#{SecureRandom.uuid}.#{file.extension}" if original_filename.present?
        end
        ```

3.  **Strict OS Permissions:**

    *   **Dedicated User:**  Run the web server process under a dedicated user account with limited privileges.  Never use the `root` user.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant the web server user only the necessary permissions to write to the upload directory.  Use `chmod` and `chown` to configure permissions correctly.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review and audit file permissions to ensure they haven't been accidentally changed.
    *   **SELinux/AppArmor:**  Implement mandatory access control using SELinux or AppArmor to further restrict the web server's capabilities.

4.  **Additional Security Measures:**

    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input, including file types, sizes, and any associated metadata.
    *   **WAF:**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall to detect and block directory traversal attempts.
    *   **IDS:**  Use an Intrusion Detection System to monitor for suspicious activity.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep CarrierWave, Rails, and all other dependencies up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
