# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Improper MIME Type Checking leading to RCE (CarrierWave)

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the attack tree path "Improper MIME Type Checking leading to RCE" within the context of a Ruby on Rails application utilizing the CarrierWave gem for file uploads.  The primary objective is to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to prevent Remote Code Execution (RCE).  We will focus on the interaction between CarrierWave's configuration, the underlying web server, and potential attacker techniques.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **High-Risk Path 1: Improper MIME Type Checking leading to RCE**
    *   1.1.1 Improper MIME Type Checking
    *   2.1.1 Double Extension (e.g., .php.jpg)
    *   2.1.1.1 Bypass Content-Type Validation (e.g., using magic bytes)

The analysis will consider:

*   Default CarrierWave configurations and common developer misconfigurations.
*   Interactions with common web servers (Apache, Nginx).
*   Attacker techniques to bypass file type validation.
*   Ruby on Rails specific vulnerabilities related to file uploads.
*   The Carrierwave gem version is assumed to be the latest stable release unless a specific vulnerability in an older version is relevant to the attack path.

This analysis will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors unrelated to file uploads.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
*   Client-side attacks (e.g., XSS) *unless* they are a direct consequence of the RCE vulnerability.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *other than* CarrierWave and its direct dependencies, unless they are directly relevant to the attack path.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific code patterns and configurations in CarrierWave and the Rails application that could lead to the vulnerabilities described in the attack tree path. This includes reviewing CarrierWave documentation, common usage patterns, and known security issues.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  For each identified vulnerability, construct realistic exploit scenarios. This will involve creating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits where feasible and safe.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful exploitation, considering factors like data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The impact is already defined in the attack tree, but we will elaborate on specific consequences.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to address each vulnerability.  These recommendations will prioritize secure coding practices, configuration changes, and the use of security tools.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  After implementing mitigations, assess any remaining residual risk.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. Node 1.1.1: Improper MIME Type Checking

*   **Vulnerability Identification:**
    *   CarrierWave, by default, does *not* perform robust file type validation.  It provides a `content_type_allowlist` and `content_type_denylist` configuration option, but these rely solely on the `Content-Type` header sent by the client.  This is easily manipulated.
    *   Developers often misunderstand the purpose of these options, believing they provide strong security.
    *   Example vulnerable code (in an uploader):
        ```ruby
        class ImageUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
          # ... other configurations ...

          def content_type_allowlist
            ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']
          end
        end
        ```
        This code *only* checks the `Content-Type` header.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**
    1.  Attacker crafts a PHP file containing a web shell: `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`.
    2.  Attacker saves the file as `shell.php`.
    3.  Attacker uses a tool like Burp Suite or `curl` to intercept the upload request.
    4.  Attacker changes the `Content-Type` header to `image/jpeg`.
    5.  The application accepts the file because the `Content-Type` matches the allowlist.
    6.  The attacker accesses the uploaded file (e.g., `/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls`) and executes arbitrary commands.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  Attacker can read, modify, or delete any file on the server.
    *   **Integrity:**  Attacker can modify application code, database contents, or any other data.
    *   **Availability:**  Attacker can shut down the server, delete critical files, or otherwise disrupt service.

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Never rely solely on the `Content-Type` header.**
    2.  **Use file content inspection:**  Implement server-side validation that analyzes the *actual* file content, not just the header.  This can be done using libraries like:
        *   `file` command (Unix/Linux):  `file --mime-type -b uploaded_file.path`
        *   Ruby's `MIME::Types` (but be cautious, as it can still be fooled by magic bytes alone):  `MIME::Types.type_for(uploaded_file.path).first.content_type`
        *   **Recommended:** Combine `file` command (for speed and reliability) with a Ruby gem like `marcel` (which is used internally by Active Storage and is more robust than `MIME::Types`):
            ```ruby
            require 'marcel'
            def validate_content_type(file)
              detected_type = Marcel::MimeType.for(file)
              allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']
              unless allowed_types.include?(detected_type)
                errors.add(:file, "Invalid file type.  Must be one of: #{allowed_types.join(', ')}")
              end
            end
            ```
    3.  **Store uploaded files outside the web root:**  This prevents direct execution of uploaded files even if they contain malicious code.
    4.  **Use a randomized filename:**  Don't use the original filename provided by the user.  Generate a unique, random filename (e.g., using `SecureRandom.uuid`) to prevent attackers from guessing the file path.
    5.  **Limit file size:**  Set a reasonable maximum file size to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    6.  **Consider using a dedicated file storage service:** Services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage provide built-in security features and can offload file handling from your application server.

*   **Residual Risk:** Low, if all mitigations are implemented correctly.  The primary residual risk is misconfiguration or human error in implementing the validation logic.

### 4.2. Node 2.1.1: Double Extension (e.g., .php.jpg)

*   **Vulnerability Identification:**
    *   This vulnerability primarily targets misconfigured web servers, particularly older versions of Apache (using `mod_php`).  If Apache is configured to execute files based on the *first* recognized extension, a file named `malicious.php.jpg` might be executed as PHP code.
    *   Nginx typically does not suffer from this vulnerability, as it usually requires an explicit configuration to execute files with specific extensions.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**
    1.  Attacker uploads a file named `shell.php.jpg`.
    2.  The application (due to the vulnerability in 1.1.1) accepts the file.
    3.  The misconfigured Apache server executes the file as PHP code because it encounters the `.php` extension first.

*   **Impact Assessment:**  Same as 1.1.1 (RCE).

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Ensure proper web server configuration:**
        *   **Apache:**  Use the `FilesMatch` directive to explicitly define which files should be executed as PHP.  Avoid using `AddHandler` or `AddType` in a way that allows execution based on the first extension.  Example (safe configuration):
            ```apache
            <FilesMatch \.php$>
                SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
            </FilesMatch>
            ```
        *   **Nginx:**  Ensure that your `location` blocks for PHP files are correctly configured to only execute files with the `.php` extension.  Example (safe configuration):
            ```nginx
            location ~ \.php$ {
                # ... fastcgi configuration ...
            }
            ```
    2.  **Reject files with multiple extensions:**  Add validation in your CarrierWave uploader to reject files containing multiple periods in the filename (except for a single period separating the base name and extension).
        ```ruby
        def validate_filename
          if file.filename.count('.') > 1
            errors.add(:file, "Invalid filename.  Multiple extensions are not allowed.")
          end
        end
        ```
    3.  All mitigations from 1.1.1 also apply here.

*   **Residual Risk:** Low, if web server is properly configured and filename validation is implemented.

### 4.3. Node 2.1.1.1: Bypass Content-Type Validation (e.g., using magic bytes)

*   **Vulnerability Identification:**
    *   Simple content type checks that only examine the first few bytes (magic bytes) of a file can be bypassed.  An attacker can craft a file that starts with the magic bytes of a valid image type (e.g., `\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0` for JPEG) but then contains malicious PHP code.
    *   Relying solely on Ruby's `MIME::Types` or similar libraries that only check magic bytes is insufficient.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**
    1.  Attacker creates a file with the following content (hex representation):
        ```
        FF D8 FF E0  ... (valid JPEG header) ...
        3C 3F 70 68 70 20 73 79 73 74 65 6D 28 24 5F 47 45 54 5B 27 63 6D 64 27 5D 29 3B 20 3F 3E  (<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>)
        ```
    2.  The attacker uploads this file, setting the `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.
    3.  The application's simplistic validation checks only the first few bytes and sees the JPEG magic bytes, assuming it's a valid image.
    4.  The attacker accesses the uploaded file and executes arbitrary commands.

*   **Impact Assessment:** Same as 1.1.1 (RCE).

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Use robust content inspection:**  As recommended in 1.1.1, use a combination of the `file` command and a library like `marcel` to perform more thorough content type validation.  `marcel` goes beyond simple magic byte checks and analyzes the file structure.
    2.  **Image processing libraries:**  If you are dealing with images, consider using an image processing library like `MiniMagick` (which wraps ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick) to *process* the uploaded image.  Attempting to process a non-image file will usually result in an error, effectively validating the file.  This also helps prevent other image-related vulnerabilities (e.g., ImageTragick).
        ```ruby
        class ImageUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
          include CarrierWave::MiniMagick

          process resize_to_limit: [800, 600] # Example processing

          def validate_image
            begin
              MiniMagick::Image.open(file.path)
            rescue MiniMagick::Error => e
              errors.add(:file, "Invalid image file: #{e.message}")
            end
          end
        end
        ```
    3.  All mitigations from 1.1.1 and 2.1.1 also apply.

*   **Residual Risk:** Low, if robust content inspection and/or image processing are implemented.  The main residual risk is a zero-day vulnerability in the image processing library itself.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack tree path "Improper MIME Type Checking leading to RCE" represents a significant security risk for applications using CarrierWave.  By relying solely on the `Content-Type` header or performing superficial file content checks, applications become vulnerable to RCE attacks.  The mitigations outlined above, including robust content inspection, proper web server configuration, filename validation, and the use of image processing libraries, are crucial for preventing these attacks.  Regular security audits and staying up-to-date with the latest security best practices are essential for maintaining a secure file upload system.
