# Threat Model Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Threat: [Malicious File Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_file_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Execution (RCE)
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a file with a malicious payload (e.g., a PHP script, shell script, or executable) disguised as a permitted file type (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`).  The attacker might rename a `.php` file to `.jpg`, or embed malicious code within a seemingly harmless file. If the server executes this file (due to misconfiguration or lack of validation), the attacker gains control.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise, data theft, data destruction, further network attacks.
    *   **CarrierWave Component Affected:** `Uploader` class (general file handling), `store_dir` configuration, potentially any processing modules (e.g., `MiniMagick`, `RMagick` if they are used to "process" the malicious file). `validate_mime_type_inclusion`, `validate_mime_type_exclusion`, `extension_whitelist`, `extension_blacklist` (if bypassed or misconfigured).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Content Type Validation:** Do *not* rely on file extensions or client-provided `Content-Type`. Use server-side validation with libraries like `mimemagic` to determine the *true* file type based on content. Prefer whitelisting allowed MIME types.
        *   **File Signature Validation:** Inspect the file's "magic bytes" to verify its type.
        *   **Filename Sanitization:** Use CarrierWave's `filename` method to sanitize and generate a unique, random filename on the server (e.g., with `SecureRandom.uuid`). Do *not* use user-supplied filenames directly.
        *   **Non-Executable Storage:** Store uploaded files in a directory *outside* the web root and ensure the web server is configured to *not* execute files from that directory.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Processing:** If image processing isn't needed, disable it. If it *is* needed, keep processing libraries updated and use ImageMagick's policy.xml.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Oversized Files](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_oversized_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Oversized Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads an extremely large file (or many large files) to exhaust server resources (disk space, memory, CPU, bandwidth).
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential financial losses.
    *   **CarrierWave Component Affected:** `Uploader` class (general file handling), `validate_size_range` (if not used or set too high).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Size Limits:** Use CarrierWave's `validate_size_range` to enforce both minimum and maximum file size limits. Choose limits appropriate for your application's needs.
        *   **Web Server Limits:** Configure the web server (Nginx, Apache) and application server (Puma, Unicorn) to limit the maximum request body size.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the server with upload requests.

## Threat: [Directory Traversal](./threats/directory_traversal.md)

*   **Threat:** Directory Traversal
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious filename (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`) to write the uploaded file outside the intended upload directory. This could overwrite system files or allow the attacker to read sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data loss, data breaches, privilege escalation.
    *   **CarrierWave Component Affected:** `Uploader` class, `store_dir` configuration, `filename` method (if not used correctly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Filename Sanitization:** *Always* use CarrierWave's `filename` method to sanitize the filename. Generate a unique, random filename on the server-side and *never* trust user-provided filenames directly.
        *   **Secure `store_dir`:** Configure `store_dir` to point to a dedicated directory *outside* the web root, with appropriate permissions. Do not allow user input to influence `store_dir`.
        *   **File Permissions:** Set restrictive file permissions on the upload directory and uploaded files (e.g., `0644` for files, `0755` for directories).

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (e.g., ImageTragick)](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities__e_g___imagetragick_.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Processing Vulnerabilities (e.g., ImageTragick)
    *   **Description:** If CarrierWave uses ImageMagick, RMagick, or MiniMagick for image processing, vulnerabilities in these libraries (like "ImageTragick") can be exploited by uploading specially crafted image files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), server compromise.
    *   **CarrierWave Component Affected:** `MiniMagick` integration, `RMagick` integration, `process` method (if used for image manipulation). `validate_processing`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Ensure ImageMagick, RMagick, and MiniMagick are *always* up-to-date.
        *   **ImageMagick Policy:** Use ImageMagick's `policy.xml` file to restrict operations and resources.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any user-provided data passed to image processing libraries.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** Explore alternative image processing libraries.
        * **Use `validate_processing`:** Use this callback to check if processing was successful.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote URLs](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_remote_urls.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote URLs
    *   **Description:** If CarrierWave is configured to allow uploading files from remote URLs, an attacker can provide a URL pointing to an internal service or a sensitive external resource. The server fetches this resource, potentially exposing internal data or allowing interaction with other services.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data exfiltration, denial of service, interaction with external services on behalf of the server.
    *   **CarrierWave Component Affected:** `remote_<attribute>_url` functionality (where `<attribute>` is the name of your uploader attribute), `validate_download` (if not used or bypassed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Remote Uploads:** If not essential, disable them.
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** If required, *strictly* whitelist allowed domains or URLs.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the application server from sensitive internal resources.
        * **Use `validate_download`:** Use this callback to validate remote URL.
