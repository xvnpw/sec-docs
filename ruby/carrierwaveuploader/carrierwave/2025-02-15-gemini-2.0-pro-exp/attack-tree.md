## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1:  Improper MIME Type Checking leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1__improper_mime_type_checking_leading_to_rce.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path represents the most likely route for an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting weaknesses in how the application validates uploaded files. It leverages the common mistake of relying solely on the easily spoofed `Content-Type` HTTP header.

*   **Steps:**

    1.  **1.1.1 Improper MIME Type Checking [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The application only checks the `Content-Type` header provided by the client (browser or attacker's tool) during file upload. This header can be easily manipulated. The application does *not* verify the actual file content.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (potential for RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    2.  **2.1.1 Double Extension (e.g., .php.jpg) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker uploads a file with a double extension, such as `malicious.php.jpg`.  This exploits misconfigured web servers (e.g., older Apache setups) that might execute the first extension (`.php`) if the last extension (`.jpg`) is not recognized or handled.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    3.  **2.1.1.1 Bypass Content-Type Validation (e.g., using magic bytes) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a file that *appears* to be a valid image (e.g., a JPEG) by including the correct "magic bytes" (file signature) at the beginning of the file.  However, after the initial bytes that make it look like an image, the file contains malicious PHP code.  This bypasses simple content checks that only look at the beginning of the file.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (without High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__without_high-risk_path_.md)

1.  **2.2.1 ImageTragick Exploit (if used) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses ImageMagick (or a wrapper like MiniMagick) for image processing, *and* an unpatched, vulnerable version is present, the attacker can upload a specially crafted image file designed to exploit known vulnerabilities (collectively known as "ImageTragick").
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (due to widespread patching)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
2.  **2.2.1.1 Bypass Image Processing Library Validation [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** This represents a zero-day vulnerability scenario. The attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the image processing library (e.g., ImageMagick, MiniMagick, RMagick). They craft an image file that triggers this vulnerability, leading to RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
