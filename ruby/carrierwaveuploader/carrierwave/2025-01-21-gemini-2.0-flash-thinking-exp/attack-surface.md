# Attack Surface Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file's content or type.
    *   **How CarrierWave Contributes:** CarrierWave handles the file upload process, and if not configured with appropriate validation mechanisms, it will store whatever file is uploaded. The responsibility for implementing these checks lies with the developer using CarrierWave's features.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image file. If the web server is configured to execute PHP in the upload directory, this script could be executed, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, defacement, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed file extensions using CarrierWave's `extension_whitelist` or `extension_blacklist`.
        *   Use content-based validation (e.g., checking magic numbers or file signatures) within CarrierWave's validation framework.
        *   Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.
        *   Utilize CarrierWave's `processing` block to sanitize or transform uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Filename Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/filename_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate uploaded filenames.
    *   **How CarrierWave Contributes:** CarrierWave, by default, often uses the original filename provided by the user. If this filename is not sanitized within the uploader, it can introduce vulnerabilities when used in file system operations managed by CarrierWave.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application uses CarrierWave's default filename storage without sanitization, it could lead to directory traversal when the file is accessed or processed.
    *   **Impact:** Directory traversal, local file inclusion, command injection (if the filename is used in shell commands within CarrierWave processors), denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize filenames within the CarrierWave uploader using methods like `sanitize_regexp` or custom sanitization logic.
        *   Generate unique, predictable filenames on the server-side within the uploader using CarrierWave's filename customization options.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided filenames in file system paths managed by CarrierWave without sanitization.
        *   Enforce maximum filename length within the uploader.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage Location and Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_location_and_access.md)

*   **Description:** Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible location without proper access controls.
    *   **How CarrierWave Contributes:** CarrierWave handles the storage of files, and the developer configures the storage location (local filesystem or cloud storage) through CarrierWave's configuration. Incorrect configuration can lead to public accessibility.
    *   **Example:** User profile pictures are stored in a publicly accessible directory configured within CarrierWave. An attacker can enumerate these directories and access other users' private photos.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violation, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure CarrierWave to store uploaded files in directories that are not directly accessible by the web server.
        *   Implement access control mechanisms at the application level to ensure only authorized users can access specific files managed by CarrierWave.
        *   For cloud storage configured through CarrierWave, ensure appropriate bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) are in place to restrict public access.
        *   Consider using signed URLs generated by CarrierWave or the cloud storage provider for temporary access to private files.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses image processing libraries (often integrated with CarrierWave) that have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **How CarrierWave Contributes:** CarrierWave often integrates with gems like `mini_magick` or `vips` for image processing within its `process` blocks. If these underlying libraries have vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through uploaded image files processed by CarrierWave.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in ImageMagick (e.g., "ImageTragick"), leading to remote code execution on the server during CarrierWave's processing.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep image processing libraries used by CarrierWave updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using safer image processing libraries or sandboxing the processing environment used by CarrierWave.
        *   Implement input validation on image files before processing them within CarrierWave's `process` block.
