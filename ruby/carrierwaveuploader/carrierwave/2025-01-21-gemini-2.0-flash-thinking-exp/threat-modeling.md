# Threat Model Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Threat: [Publicly Accessible Storage Location](./threats/publicly_accessible_storage_location.md)

*   **Threat:** Publicly Accessible Storage Location
    *   **Description:** An attacker could directly access uploaded files by knowing or guessing the file path if the storage location is within the web server's public directory. They might enumerate directories or use information leaks to discover file paths.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data stored in uploaded files could be exposed, leading to privacy breaches, reputational damage, or legal repercussions. Sensitive documents, user data, or proprietary information could be compromised.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:** `Storage::File` (when using local storage with default configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure CarrierWave to use a storage location outside the web server's document root.
        *   Utilize cloud storage providers (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) with proper access controls.

## Threat: [Insecure Cloud Storage Bucket Configuration](./threats/insecure_cloud_storage_bucket_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Cloud Storage Bucket Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigured cloud storage bucket policies or Access Control Lists (ACLs) to gain unauthorized access to, modify, or delete uploaded files stored in the cloud.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized access to sensitive files), data integrity compromise (files modified or deleted), and potential financial loss due to unauthorized access or resource usage.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:** `Storage::Fog` or other cloud storage adapters, relying on the cloud provider's API and configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure cloud storage bucket policies and ACLs, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit cloud storage configurations.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads (Malicious Files)](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads__malicious_files_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted File Uploads (Malicious Files)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., viruses, malware, web shells) that could be executed if accessed or processed by the server, potentially compromising the server or other users' systems.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, malware distribution, and potential legal liabilities.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:** The upload process, potentially file processing logic defined in the uploader.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation using whitelists based on content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions.
        *   Utilize antivirus scanning on uploaded files before storing them.
        *   Define allowed file extensions and MIME types in the CarrierWave uploader.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Uploaded Files](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_uploaded_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Uploaded Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload files containing malicious scripts (e.g., HTML, SVG) that, if served with the correct content type, could be executed in the context of the application's domain, leading to XSS attacks against other users.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:**  The serving of uploaded files, influenced by how the application handles URLs generated by CarrierWave.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Serve user-uploaded files from a separate domain or subdomain with a restrictive `Content-Security-Policy` header.
        *   Set the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header to force downloads instead of rendering in the browser.
        *   Sanitize or escape file content before displaying it if rendering is necessary.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Processing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload specially crafted image files that exploit vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by CarrierWave (e.g., MiniMagick, RMagick), potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, application crash, and potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:**  Processors defined in the uploader that utilize image processing libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep image processing libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using safer image processing alternatives if available.

## Threat: [Exploiting File Processing Logic (Command Injection)](./threats/exploiting_file_processing_logic__command_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting File Processing Logic (Command Injection)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate input used in custom file processing logic within the CarrierWave uploader to inject malicious commands that are then executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, and the ability to perform arbitrary actions on the server.
    *   **Affected CarrierWave Component:**  Custom processors defined in the uploader.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and sanitize all input used in custom processing logic within CarrierWave uploaders.
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user-provided input within CarrierWave processors.
