## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via CarrierWave Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_carrierwave_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious File Upload (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_file_upload__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers aim to upload files containing malicious payloads to compromise the application.
- This path is high-risk due to the potential for direct code execution and the relative ease with which file upload mechanisms can be targeted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload and Execute Malicious Code (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_and_execute_malicious_code__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- The attacker's objective is to upload a file that can be executed by the server, granting them control over the system.
- This is a critical node as successful execution leads to the most severe form of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass File Type Validation (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_file_type_validation__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers attempt to circumvent the application's file type checks to upload malicious files disguised as legitimate ones.
  - Filename Extension Manipulation: Using techniques like double extensions (e.g., image.jpg.php) or null byte injection in the filename to trick the server into executing the file.
  - MIME Type Spoofing: Modifying the Content-Type header during the upload to misrepresent the file's actual type.
- This is a critical node because it's a primary defense mechanism against malicious uploads, and bypassing it opens the door to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Processing Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_processing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers exploit flaws in how the application processes uploaded files after they are received.
  - Command Injection via Filename or Metadata: Injecting malicious commands into system calls that use the uploaded filename or its metadata without proper sanitization.
  - Path Traversal during File Processing: Manipulating file paths during processing to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing executable code in accessible areas.
- This is a critical node because it allows attackers to leverage server-side logic to execute commands or manipulate the file system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Access Controls on Storage (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_access_controls_on_storage__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers exploit misconfigurations in storage access controls to gain unauthorized access to uploaded files.
    - Publicly Accessible Storage Buckets (Cloud Storage): Cloud storage buckets configured with overly permissive access policies, allowing anyone to read (and potentially write or delete) uploaded files.
- This is a critical node because it can lead to the exposure of sensitive data contained within the uploaded files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers take advantage of insecure default settings in CarrierWave or the application's configuration.
    - Permissive File Type Whitelists: Allowing a wide range of file types, including potentially executable ones, to be uploaded.
- This is a critical node because it represents easily exploitable weaknesses that are often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Storage Settings (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_storage_settings__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers exploit incorrect configurations related to file storage.
    - Incorrect Permissions on Storage Locations: File system permissions on the upload directory (for local storage) or access policies on cloud storage buckets that grant excessive privileges to unauthorized users.
- This is a critical node as it directly impacts the confidentiality and integrity of stored files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaked API Keys or Credentials (Cloud Storage) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_api_keys_or_credentials__cloud_storage___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers gain access to valid API keys or credentials for cloud storage services.
- This is a critical node because it provides a direct and often unrestricted way to access and manipulate stored files, bypassing application-level security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Specific CarrierWave Versions (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_specific_carrierwave_versions__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of the CarrierWave library.
- This is a critical node because it targets the core functionality of file uploads and can have a widespread impact if the application is using a vulnerable version.
