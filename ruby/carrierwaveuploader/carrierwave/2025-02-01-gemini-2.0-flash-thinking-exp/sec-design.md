This project, CarrierWave, is a Ruby library designed to simplify file uploads in web applications built with frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. Its primary business purpose is to provide developers with a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use solution for handling file uploads, processing, storage, and retrieval.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Ease of Integration: The library should be simple to integrate into existing and new Ruby web applications.
- Flexibility: It should support various storage options (local filesystem, cloud storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.) and allow for custom processing and manipulation of uploaded files.
- Reliability: The library must reliably handle file uploads and storage without data loss or corruption.
- Performance: File uploads and retrievals should be efficient and not negatively impact application performance.
- Security: The library must facilitate secure file handling to prevent vulnerabilities related to file uploads.

Business Risks:
- Data Breach: Mishandling of uploaded files could lead to unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive user data.
- Service Disruption: Vulnerabilities in file upload processing or storage could lead to denial-of-service attacks or application crashes.
- Data Integrity: Bugs or misconfigurations could result in data corruption or loss of uploaded files.
- Reputational Damage: Security vulnerabilities or data breaches related to file uploads can damage the reputation of businesses using the library.
- Compliance Violations: Failure to secure uploaded data properly may lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# SECURITY POSTURE
