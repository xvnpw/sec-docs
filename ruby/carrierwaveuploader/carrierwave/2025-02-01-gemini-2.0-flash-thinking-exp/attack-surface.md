# Attack Surface Analysis for carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

## Attack Surface: [Inadequate File Type Validation](./attack_surfaces/inadequate_file_type_validation.md)

**Description:** Carrierwave, by design, delegates file type validation to the developer. If developers fail to implement robust server-side validation, attackers can bypass intended file type restrictions.

**Carrierwave Contribution:** Carrierwave's flexibility in validation means that weak or missing validation logic directly stems from how Carrierwave is implemented in the application.

**Example:**  A Carrierwave uploader is configured to allow "images," but only checks the file extension on the client-side. An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script renamed to `image.jpg`. Without server-side content type verification, this script could be processed by the server if placed in a web-accessible directory.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data corruption, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement Server-Side Content Type Validation:** Use libraries like `MIME::Types` in Ruby to verify the actual content type of uploaded files based on their magic numbers, not just file extensions.
*   **Whitelist Allowed MIME Types:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed MIME types in your Carrierwave uploader and reject any file that doesn't match.
*   **Avoid Client-Side Validation as Primary Security:** Client-side validation is easily bypassed and should only be used for user experience, not security.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) to Uploaded Files (due to predictable naming)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__to_uploaded_files__due_to_predictable_naming_.md)

**Description:** Carrierwave's default or poorly configured filename generation can lead to predictable file URLs. This allows attackers to guess and access files they are not authorized to view.

**Carrierwave Contribution:**  If developers rely on default filename generation or implement predictable naming schemes within Carrierwave uploaders, they directly create this vulnerability.

**Example:** Carrierwave is configured to store files with sequential IDs. User profile pictures are accessible at URLs like `/uploads/user/avatar/1.jpg`, `/uploads/user/avatar/2.jpg`, etc. An attacker can easily iterate through these URLs to access other users' private profile pictures.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use UUID or Random Filenames:** Configure Carrierwave to generate unique and unpredictable filenames using UUIDs or random string generators. Carrierwave's `:uuid` storage option is a good starting point.
*   **Implement Access Control:** Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to control access to uploaded files at the application level, even if filenames are unpredictable.
*   **Consider Private Storage:** Utilize private cloud storage buckets or restrict direct web access to the upload directory, serving files through application logic with access control.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Storage Paths (due to misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_storage_paths__due_to_misconfiguration_.md)

**Description:**  Improper handling of file paths within Carrierwave configuration or application code can allow attackers to manipulate paths and potentially access or overwrite files outside the intended upload directory.

**Carrierwave Contribution:** While Carrierwave itself doesn't inherently cause path traversal, misconfigurations in how developers define storage paths, process filenames, or handle user-provided input related to file paths within Carrierwave uploaders can introduce this vulnerability.

**Example:**  A Carrierwave uploader incorrectly concatenates user-provided input with the base upload path without proper sanitization. An attacker crafts a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` which, when processed by the vulnerable code, could lead to attempts to write or read system files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized file access, file overwriting, potential system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize User Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided input that influences file paths or filenames used in Carrierwave.
*   **Use Absolute Paths:** Define storage paths using absolute paths and avoid relative path manipulations within Carrierwave configuration and application code.
*   **Restrict File Operations:** Limit file system operations performed by the application to the intended upload directory and prevent access to parent directories.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Libraries (via Carrierwave integration)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_image_processing_libraries__via_carrierwave_integration_.md)

**Description:** Carrierwave often integrates with image processing libraries like ImageMagick or MiniMagick. Exploitable vulnerabilities in these libraries can be triggered by uploading specially crafted image files through Carrierwave.

**Carrierwave Contribution:** Carrierwave's direct integration with these libraries means that vulnerabilities within them become part of Carrierwave's attack surface in applications that utilize image processing features.

**Example:** An application uses Carrierwave and MiniMagick for image resizing. An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file designed to exploit a known vulnerability in MiniMagick (e.g., ImageTragick), potentially leading to Remote Code Execution on the server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Image Processing Libraries Updated:** Regularly update ImageMagick, MiniMagick, and any other image processing libraries used by Carrierwave to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Restrict Image Processing Functionality:**  Disable or restrict potentially dangerous features of image processing libraries, such as delegate policies in ImageMagick, if not strictly necessary.
*   **Input Sanitization for Image Processing:** Sanitize and validate image files before passing them to image processing libraries to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities through malicious file formats.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Uploaded Files (due to improper serving)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_uploaded_files__due_to_improper_serving_.md)

**Description:** If Carrierwave is used to serve user-uploaded files directly without proper `Content-Type` headers and sanitization, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., HTML, SVG, JavaScript) that execute scripts in other users' browsers when accessed.

**Carrierwave Contribution:** Carrierwave's role in managing file storage and retrieval means that if developers don't configure proper serving mechanisms and rely on direct access to uploaded files, Carrierwave becomes a pathway for delivering malicious content.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript. If the application serves this SVG file with an incorrect or missing `Content-Type` header, browsers might render it inline, executing the embedded JavaScript and potentially leading to XSS attacks against users who view the file.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), account compromise, data theft, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Set Correct `Content-Type` Headers:**  Ensure that your application and web server are configured to serve uploaded files with accurate `Content-Type` headers based on the detected file type.
*   **Force Download for Potentially Executable Files:** For file types that could contain executable code (e.g., HTML, SVG, JavaScript), serve them with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` headers to force browsers to download them instead of rendering them inline.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if malicious files are served.
*   **Separate Domain for User Content:** Serve user-uploaded content from a separate domain or subdomain to isolate it from the main application domain and limit the potential damage from XSS.
