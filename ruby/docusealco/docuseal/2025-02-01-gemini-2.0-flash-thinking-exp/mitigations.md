## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Document Hashing and Verification (Docuseal Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_document_hashing_and_verification__docuseal_integration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Document Hashing and Verification (Docuseal Integration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Docuseal's API or Hooks (if available):** Explore Docuseal's API or available hooks to integrate document hashing into its workflow. If Docuseal provides events for document upload, signing, and finalization, use these to trigger hash generation.
    2.  **Customize Docuseal Workflow (if possible):** If Docuseal allows workflow customization, integrate hash verification steps into the document workflow. For example, before displaying a document for signing, automatically verify its hash.
    3.  **Extend Docuseal Data Model (if possible):** If Docuseal's data model is extensible, add fields to store document hashes at different stages (uploaded hash, signed hash, finalized hash).
    4.  **Develop Custom Verification UI/Functionality:** If Docuseal doesn't provide built-in hash verification UI, develop custom UI elements or functions that allow users or administrators to manually trigger and view hash verification results.
    5.  **Integrate with External Hash Storage (if needed):** If Docuseal's storage is not suitable for secure hash storage, integrate with an external secure storage service to store and retrieve document hashes.
    6.  **Log Hash Verification Events within Docuseal:** Ensure that hash verification attempts and results are logged within Docuseal's logging system for auditing and troubleshooting.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Document Tampering (High Severity):** Unauthorized modification of documents *within the Docuseal workflow*.
    *   **Integrity Violation (High Severity):** Loss of confidence in the authenticity and reliability of documents *processed by Docuseal*.
    *   **Non-Repudiation Weakness (Medium Severity):** Difficulty in proving document integrity *within the Docuseal signing process* if tampering occurs undetected.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Document Tampering:** Significantly Reduced *within Docuseal*. Hash verification makes tampering easily detectable within the platform.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Significantly Reduced *for documents managed by Docuseal*. Provides strong evidence of document integrity within the system.
