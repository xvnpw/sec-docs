# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Docuseal project aims to provide an open-source platform for document signing and verification. This suggests a business need for secure and auditable digital document workflows. Businesses and individuals require reliable and trustworthy methods to sign documents electronically, ensuring integrity and non-repudiation.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a functional and user-friendly open-source document signing platform.
- Ensure the security and integrity of signed documents.
- Offer a cost-effective alternative to proprietary document signing solutions.
- Build a community around the open-source project for ongoing development and support.
- Enable customization and extensibility to meet diverse user needs.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or manipulation of signed documents.
- Lack of user adoption due to poor usability or lack of trust in an open-source solution.
- Legal and compliance risks if the platform does not meet regulatory requirements for digital signatures in different jurisdictions.
- Dependence on community contributions for maintenance and feature development, potentially leading to project stagnation.
- Reputational damage if security incidents or functional issues arise.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS is likely used for communication, protecting data in transit. (Assumption based on common web application practices).
- security control:  Basic user authentication is expected to manage user accounts. (Assumption based on application functionality).
- security control:  Authorization mechanisms are likely in place to control access to documents and signing functionalities. (Assumption based on application functionality).
- security control:  Input validation is expected to prevent common web application vulnerabilities. (Assumption based on standard secure development practices).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, initial security testing and code review might be limited to community contributions.
- accepted risk:  Rapid development cycles in early stages might prioritize functionality over in-depth security hardening.
- accepted risk:  Reliance on community for vulnerability reporting and patching might lead to slower response times compared to commercial solutions with dedicated security teams.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a robust Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) including security requirements gathering, threat modeling, secure coding practices, static and dynamic code analysis, and penetration testing.
- security control: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to protect user accounts.
- security control: Implement fine-grained authorization controls based on roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- security control:  Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues by the community.
- security control:  Perform regular security audits and penetration testing by independent security experts.
- security control:  Implement security logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
- security control:  Ensure secure storage of cryptographic keys used for document signing and verification, potentially using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key management services for sensitive deployments.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: The system must provide secure user authentication to verify the identity of users accessing the platform.
    - security requirement: Support for strong password policies, including complexity requirements and password rotation.
    - security requirement: Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    - security requirement: Secure session management to prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to functionalities.
    - security requirement:  Ensure proper authorization checks are performed before granting access to documents and signing operations.
    - security requirement:  Principle of least privilege should be applied to user roles and permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement:  All user inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)).
    - security requirement:  File uploads must be validated to prevent malicious file uploads.
    - security requirement:  Data sanitization and encoding should be applied to prevent output encoding vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement:  Use strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for document signing and verification.
    - security requirement:  Securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys.
    - security requirement:  Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of documents during storage and transmission using encryption.
    - security requirement:  Implement digital signatures according to relevant standards (e.g., PKCS#7, X.509).
    - security requirement:  Consider using timestamping services to ensure the long-term validity of digital signatures.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Document Signing Process:  Ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of signed documents.
- Document Verification Process:  Reliably verifying the authenticity and integrity of signed documents.
- User Management: Securely managing user accounts and access permissions.
- Audit Logging:  Maintaining a comprehensive and tamper-proof audit trail of system activities.
- Key Management: Securely generating, storing, and managing cryptographic keys used for signing and verification.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- User Data:
    - Sensitivity: Personal data (names, email addresses, etc.) - Moderate to High sensitivity depending on jurisdiction and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    - Data type: User profiles, contact information, authentication credentials.
- Document Content:
    - Sensitivity: Confidential documents, potentially containing sensitive business information, personal data, or legally binding agreements - High sensitivity.
    - Data type: Uploaded documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Audit Logs:
    - Sensitivity: Security-relevant events, user activities - Moderate sensitivity, crucial for security monitoring and incident response.
    - Data type: Log entries containing timestamps, user actions, event details.
- Cryptographic Keys:
    - Sensitivity: Private keys used for signing - Critical sensitivity. Compromise would allow unauthorized signing and undermine the security of the entire system.
    - Data type: Private keys, public keys, certificates.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific compliance requirements for digital signatures that Docuseal needs to meet (e.g., eIDAS, ESIGN Act)?
- What is the intended deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
- Is there a preferred Identity Provider to integrate with?
- Are there specific requirements for document storage (e.g., data residency, encryption requirements)?
- Is there a need for integration with specific timestamping services?
- What is the expected user base and document signing volume?
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that Docuseal needs to adhere to?
- What is the process for vulnerability reporting and patching for the open-source project?
- Are there plans for penetration testing or security audits?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and functional open-source document signing platform. Security and data integrity are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE:  Basic security controls like HTTPS and user authentication are assumed to be in place or planned.  However, a comprehensive SSDLC and proactive security measures are recommended for a production-ready system.
- DESIGN: A typical three-tier web application architecture with a separate API, database, and potentially a dedicated signing service is assumed. Cloud deployment on AWS is used as a detailed example, but other deployment options are possible. A standard CI/CD pipeline with security scanning is assumed for the build process.
