# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Document Uploads](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_document_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Define Allowed File Types:**  Clearly define and enforce a whitelist of allowed file types for document uploads that Docuseal is intended to process (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`). Reject any file with an extension not on this whitelist. Implement this on both client and server sides.
    *   Step 2: **Server-Side File Type Validation (Magic Number):** On the server-side, use libraries to verify the file type based on its magic number (file signature) and not just the file extension. This is crucial as Docuseal processes uploaded files, and incorrect file type handling can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 3: **Document Content Sanitization (Docuseal Processing Context):** Employ document parsing and sanitization libraries relevant to the file types Docuseal processes. Focus on sanitizing content that Docuseal will interact with or display, preventing injection attacks within the Docuseal workflow.
    *   Step 4: **File Size Limits (Docuseal Resource Management):** Implement file size limits for uploads to prevent denial-of-service attacks and resource exhaustion, considering Docuseal's processing capabilities and resource constraints.
    *   Step 5: **Error Handling and Logging (Docuseal Upload Failures):** Implement proper error handling for invalid file uploads within the Docuseal application. Log details of rejected uploads (filename, user, timestamp) specifically within Docuseal's logging framework for auditing and security monitoring related to document processing.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious File Upload (High Severity):  Attackers uploading files that exploit vulnerabilities in Docuseal's document processing or dependencies.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Document Metadata or Content (Medium Severity): Injecting malicious scripts into document metadata or content that could be executed when Docuseal renders or processes the document.
    *   Command Injection via Document Processing (Medium Severity): Exploiting vulnerabilities in document parsing libraries used by Docuseal to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Large File Uploads (Medium Severity):  Overwhelming server resources when Docuseal attempts to process excessively large files.

*   **Impact:**
