Okay, let's dive into creating a design document for Docuseal, based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Docuseal is an open-source document signing platform, aiming to provide a secure and user-friendly alternative to proprietary solutions like DocuSign.  The business priorities appear to be:

*   Provide a cost-effective alternative to commercial document signing solutions.
*   Offer a self-hostable solution, giving users full control over their data and infrastructure.
*   Maintain a high level of security and compliance to ensure the integrity and legality of signed documents.
*   Build a strong community around the open-source project, encouraging contributions and fostering trust.
*   Offer a simple, intuitive user experience for both document senders and signers.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive documents.
*   Non-compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., eIDAS, GDPR, HIPAA) leading to legal issues.
*   Loss of document integrity, rendering signed documents invalid.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or data breaches.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or poor user experience.
*   Supply chain attacks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the repository review, here's a breakdown of the existing security controls, accepted risks, recommended controls, and security requirements:

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication via Devise, a flexible authentication solution for Rails. (Described in Gemfile and likely configured in `config/initializers/devise.rb` and related models/controllers).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is likely implemented, although the specifics need further investigation within the codebase.  There's mention of `User` and `Admin` roles, suggesting some level of authorization.
*   security control: Input Validation: Rails' built-in mechanisms for handling user input and preventing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) are likely used, but specific implementations need to be verified. (ActiveRecord validations and strong parameters are expected).
*   security control: Cryptography: HTTPS is enforced in production, ensuring encrypted communication between the client and server. (Likely configured in `config/environments/production.rb`). Storage of sensitive data (e.g., document files, signatures) is likely encrypted at rest, but this needs confirmation.
*   security control: Session Management: Secure session management using cookies, likely with appropriate flags (HttpOnly, Secure) set. (Managed by Devise and Rails).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Use of Bundler to manage dependencies and `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent versions.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The project appears to be actively maintained, suggesting regular updates and security patches.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The specific implementation details of RBAC and authorization need further review to ensure they adequately cover all access control scenarios.
*   accepted risk: The exact methods used for encrypting data at rest (documents, signatures) require confirmation.
*   accepted risk: While Rails provides some protection against XSS and SQL injection, a thorough review of all user input handling is necessary.
*   accepted risk: The project's reliance on third-party libraries (gems) introduces a potential supply chain risk.
*   accepted risk: The self-hosted nature of Docuseal means that users are responsible for securing their own infrastructure, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust auditing system to track all user actions and document access.
*   Integrate with a security scanning tool (e.g., Brakeman for Rails) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities during development.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
*   Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure deployment and configuration.
*   Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   Implement signing of commits.
*   Implement regular penetration testing.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (account lockout).
    *   Secure password reset mechanisms.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (recommended).

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to documents and features based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Principle of least privilege: users should only have access to the resources they need.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user input on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use of whitelisting (allowing only known-good input) rather than blacklisting.
    *   Proper encoding of output to prevent XSS.
    *   Protection against SQL injection using parameterized queries or ORM features.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Regular review and updating of cryptographic libraries.
    *   Digital signatures for documents using appropriate cryptographic algorithms and standards (e.g., PAdES).

## BUILD

The Docuseal project uses Ruby on Rails, and therefore likely uses Bundler for dependency management.  A typical build process would involve:

1.  Developer commits code to the repository.
2.  A Continuous Integration (CI) system (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins) is triggered.
3.  The CI system checks out the code.
4.  Bundler installs the required dependencies (gems) based on the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.
5.  Static analysis tools (e.g., Brakeman, Rubocop) are run to check for security vulnerabilities and code style issues.
6.  Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed.
7.  If all tests and checks pass, a Docker image is built.
8.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

    C -- Build Image --> G
    G -- Push Image --> H
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Bundler and `Gemfile.lock` ensure consistent and controlled dependencies, reducing the risk of using vulnerable versions.
*   Static Analysis: Tools like Brakeman help identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code before deployment.
*   Automated Tests: Unit and integration tests help ensure the code functions as expected and can catch security-related bugs.
*   Containerization: Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for running the application, reducing the risk of environment-specific issues.
*   Secure Container Registry: Using a secure container registry (e.g., with vulnerability scanning) helps ensure that only trusted images are deployed.
*   Least Privilege: CI/CD pipelines should run with the least necessary privileges.
