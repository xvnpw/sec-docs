# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Search or Filtering in Docuseal

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities within Docuseal's search and filtering functionalities.  This includes identifying specific code areas at risk, assessing the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and providing concrete recommendations for remediation and prevention.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that Docuseal is robustly protected against this critical threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following areas within the Docuseal codebase:

*   **All code paths** that handle user-provided input used in search or filtering operations. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   API endpoints that accept search queries or filter parameters.
    *   Functions that construct SQL queries (or ORM equivalents) based on this input.
    *   Database interaction layers (whether direct SQL or through an ORM).
    *   Any custom query builders or helper functions involved in the process.
*   **The database schema** relevant to search and filtering, to understand the potential impact of successful injection.
*   **Existing security configurations** related to database access, including user permissions and connection settings.
*   **The chosen ORM (if any) and its configuration**, focusing on how it handles parameterization and escaping.

This analysis *excludes* other potential attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly relate to the exploitation of SQL injection in the search/filtering context.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (Manual Review):**  A thorough manual review of the Docuseal codebase (using the GitHub repository) will be conducted.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all entry points for search/filter input.
    *   Tracing the flow of this input through the application logic.
    *   Examining how SQL queries are constructed and executed.
    *   Identifying any instances of string concatenation or interpolation involving user input in query building.
    *   Checking for the consistent use of parameterized queries or equivalent ORM mechanisms.
    *   Reviewing input validation and sanitization routines.
    *   Analyzing the ORM configuration for secure defaults and potential bypasses.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing - if environment available):** If a test environment is available, dynamic testing will be performed:
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Sending a wide range of specially crafted inputs (including common SQL injection payloads) to the search and filter interfaces.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Attempting to exploit potential vulnerabilities identified during static analysis.
    *   **Error Analysis:**  Monitoring application logs and database responses for errors or unexpected behavior that might indicate successful injection.

3.  **Database Schema Review:** Examining the database schema to understand the tables, columns, and data types involved in search and filtering. This helps assess the potential impact of a successful attack.

4.  **ORM Configuration Review:**  Analyzing the configuration of the ORM (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM) to ensure it's using parameterized queries by default and that there are no settings that could weaken this protection.

5.  **Documentation Review:** Reviewing any existing documentation related to database interactions, security best practices, and coding guidelines within the Docuseal project.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Potential Vulnerability Points (Code Review Focus)

Based on the threat description and common Docuseal usage, the following areas are likely to be high-risk and require careful scrutiny during the code review:

*   **`app/api/` directory (or equivalent):**  API endpoints handling search requests (e.g., `/api/documents/search`, `/api/templates/filter`).  Examine how the request parameters (e.g., `query`, `filter`, `sort`) are processed.
*   **`app/models/` directory (or equivalent):**  Database models and associated methods that interact with the database.  Look for functions like `find`, `findAll`, `query`, `where`, etc., and how they handle user-supplied conditions.
*   **`app/services/` or `app/utils/` (or equivalent):**  Any service or utility functions that build SQL queries or interact with the database.  Pay close attention to functions that dynamically construct queries based on input.
*   **ORM-Specific Code:**  If an ORM is used, examine how it's used to build queries.  Look for:
    *   Raw SQL queries (e.g., `sequelize.query()`).  These are high-risk if user input is directly included.
    *   ORM query builders (e.g., `Model.findAll({ where: ... })`).  Ensure that user input is passed as values to parameterized queries, *not* as part of the query structure itself.
    *   Any custom query building logic that might bypass the ORM's built-in protections.
* **Anywhere `req.query`, `req.body` or similar is used to access user input that is then used in a database query.**

### 2.2. Specific Code Examples (Hypothetical - for Illustration)

These are *hypothetical* examples to illustrate the types of vulnerabilities we're looking for.  The actual Docuseal code may differ.

**Vulnerable Example 1 (Direct SQL - String Concatenation):**

```javascript
// app/api/documents.js
async function searchDocuments(req, res) {
  const searchTerm = req.query.q;
  const query = "SELECT * FROM documents WHERE title LIKE '%" + searchTerm + "%'"; // VULNERABLE!
  try {
    const results = await db.query(query);
    res.json(results);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Error searching documents");
  }
}
```

**Vulnerable Example 2 (ORM - Incorrect Use of `where`):**

```javascript
// app/models/Document.js
async function findDocuments(searchTerm) {
  // VULNERABLE if searchTerm is directly used in the query structure
  const documents = await Document.findAll({
    where: {
      title: {
        [Op.like]: `%${searchTerm}%`, // Potentially vulnerable, depends on ORM and escaping
      },
    },
  });
  return documents;
}
```
**Vulnerable Example 3 (Bypassing ORM protections):**
```javascript
// app/models/Document.js
async function findDocuments(searchTerm) {
    const documents = await sequelize.query(
        `SELECT * FROM documents WHERE title LIKE '%${searchTerm}%'`, //VULNERABLE
        {
          type: QueryTypes.SELECT
        }
      );
  return documents;
}
```

**Safe Example 1 (Parameterized Query):**

```javascript
// app/api/documents.js
async function searchDocuments(req, res) {
  const searchTerm = req.query.q;
  const query = "SELECT * FROM documents WHERE title LIKE ?"; // SAFE - Parameterized
  try {
    const results = await db.query(query, [`%${searchTerm}%`]); // Parameter passed separately
    res.json(results);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Error searching documents");
  }
}
```

**Safe Example 2 (ORM - Correct Use):**

```javascript
// app/models/Document.js
async function findDocuments(searchTerm) {
  // SAFE - Assuming the ORM handles parameterization correctly
  const documents = await Document.findAll({
    where: {
      title: {
        [Op.like]: `%${searchTerm}%`,
      },
    },
  });
  return documents;
}
```
**Safe Example 3 (ORM - Correct Use):**
```javascript
// app/models/Document.js
async function findDocuments(searchTerm) {
    const documents = await sequelize.query(
        `SELECT * FROM documents WHERE title LIKE :searchTerm`,
        {
          replacements: { searchTerm: `%${searchTerm}%` }, //SAFE
          type: QueryTypes.SELECT
        }
      );
  return documents;
}
```

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

A successful SQL injection attack on Docuseal's search or filtering functionality could have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers could retrieve sensitive data from the `documents`, `users`, `templates`, and other related tables. This includes potentially confidential documents, user credentials, and API keys.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers could alter or delete documents, user accounts, or other data within the database.
*   **Data Loss:** Attackers could drop tables or the entire database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating user data or session information.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In some database configurations (especially if the database user has excessive privileges), SQL injection can lead to RCE on the database server, giving the attacker complete control over the server.
* **Denial of Service:** Attackers could make application unusable by injecting long running queries.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

The provided mitigation strategies are generally sound, but their effectiveness depends on consistent and correct implementation:

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the *primary* and most effective defense.  The code review must verify that *all* database interactions related to search and filtering use parameterized queries *without exception*.
*   **ORM Usage:**  If an ORM is used, it must be configured to use parameterized queries by default.  The code review should check for any instances where this protection is bypassed (e.g., using raw SQL queries with string concatenation).
*   **Input Validation:**  Input validation is a *secondary* defense.  It can help reduce the attack surface, but it *cannot* be relied upon as the sole protection against SQL injection.  The code review should check for input validation, but focus primarily on parameterized queries.  Input validation should be used to enforce expected data types and formats (e.g., limiting the length of search terms, allowing only alphanumeric characters).
*   **Least Privilege:**  Using a database user account with limited permissions is crucial.  The database user should only have the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables).  It should *not* have administrative privileges (e.g., `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`).

### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  Ensure that *all* SQL queries related to search and filtering use parameterized queries (or the ORM equivalent).  This is the single most important step.
2.  **ORM Security Audit:**  If an ORM is used, thoroughly review its configuration and usage to ensure it's using parameterized queries by default and that there are no bypasses.
3.  **Code Review Checklist:**  Develop a specific code review checklist for SQL injection vulnerabilities, focusing on the points outlined in section 2.1.
4.  **Automated Security Testing:**  Integrate automated security testing tools (e.g., static analysis tools, dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools) into the development pipeline to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities early.
5.  **Input Validation (Secondary Defense):** Implement input validation to restrict the characters and format of search and filter parameters, but do *not* rely solely on it.
6.  **Least Privilege Database User:**  Ensure that the Docuseal application connects to the database using a user account with the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
8.  **Developer Training:**  Provide developers with training on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on SQL injection prevention.
9.  **Error Handling:**  Review and improve error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information (e.g., database error messages) to the user.  Generic error messages should be used.
10. **Dependency Management:** Regularly update and patch all dependencies, including the database driver and ORM, to address any known security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

SQL Injection via search and filtering is a critical threat to Docuseal.  By diligently following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability and ensure the security and integrity of the application and its data.  Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
