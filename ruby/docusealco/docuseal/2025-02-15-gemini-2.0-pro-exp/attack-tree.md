## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependency (HR)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependency__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party library or dependency used by Docuseal (e.g., a Node.js package, database driver, or other component).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Low to Very High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Low to High (exploiting known vulnerabilities is often low effort)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Very High (exploiting known vulnerabilities requires low skill)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Storage Permissions (HR)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_storage_permissions__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to documents or data stored by Docuseal due to misconfigured permissions on cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[[Default Credentials (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__default_credentials__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains administrative access by using default credentials that were not changed after installation.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if best practices are followed)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Brute-Force Login (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__brute-force_login__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user account by systematically trying different passwords.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if no account lockout or rate limiting)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Document Template Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/document_template_manipulation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[[Inject Malicious Code into Template (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__inject_malicious_code_into_template__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into a document template, which is then executed when the document is viewed or processed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on input validation)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Submission Data Injection](./attack_tree_paths/submission_data_injection.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[[Inject XSS Payload into Submission Data (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__inject_xss_payload_into_submission_data__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious XSS payload into form fields, which is then executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on output encoding)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Inject SQL into Data Fields (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__inject_sql_into_data_fields__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects SQL code into form fields to manipulate or extract data from the database.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (if parameterized queries are used)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Signature Process Forgery/Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/signature_process_forgerybypass.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[[Forge Digital Signature (HR)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__forge_digital_signature__hr___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker forges a digital signature, allowing them to create fraudulent documents that appear to be legitimately signed.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low (If strong cryptography is used)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Very High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
