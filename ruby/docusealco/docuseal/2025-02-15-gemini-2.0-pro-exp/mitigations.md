# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Access Control within Docuseal (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_access_control_within_docuseal__rbac_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement and enforce granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) *within* Docuseal's built-in features.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define user roles specific to Docuseal usage (e.g., "Template Designer," "Document Sender," "Signer," "Approver," "Auditor").
    2.  **Define Permissions:** For *each* role, meticulously define the allowed actions *within Docuseal*:
        *   Creating/modifying/deleting templates.
        *   Sending documents to specific recipients.
        *   Accessing/viewing specific documents or folders.
        *   Signing documents.
        *   Approving documents.
        *   Managing users and permissions (Admin role).
        *   Accessing audit logs.
    3.  **Assign Users:** Assign each user to the appropriate role(s) within Docuseal's user management interface.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Regularly (e.g., quarterly) review user roles and permissions within Docuseal. Remove or adjust access as needed. Automate if possible.
    5.  **Test:** Thoroughly test each role to ensure users can *only* perform their intended actions and *cannot* access unauthorized features or documents.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Document Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing documents they shouldn't.
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive document exposure.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium to High Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious insider can do.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Medium Severity):** Reduces accidental changes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced. RBAC within Docuseal is a *primary* defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Check Docuseal's settings for "Roles," "Permissions," "Access Control."
    *   Examine the user management interface for role assignment options.
    *   Review existing user accounts and their roles.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If Docuseal lacks built-in RBAC, this is a *critical* gap. Consider feature requests or workarounds (if possible, but complex).
    *   If RBAC is present but not granular enough, identify missing permissions/roles.
    *   If user role reviews are not performed, establish a process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Docuseal Configuration (Storage & Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_docuseal_configuration__storage_&_settings_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Configure Docuseal's settings and storage options securely, focusing on data protection and access control.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Storage Location:**  Understand *exactly* where Docuseal stores documents (database, filesystem, external service).  Refer to Docuseal's documentation.
    2.  **Database Settings (if applicable):**
        *   **Dedicated User:** Ensure Docuseal uses a dedicated database user with *minimal* privileges (only on relevant tables).  *Never* use the database root/admin account.
        *   **Strong Password:**  Set a strong, unique password for the Docuseal database user *within Docuseal's configuration*.
    3.  **Filesystem Settings (if applicable):**
        *   **Restrictive Permissions:**  Configure the document storage directory within Docuseal to use the most restrictive permissions possible. Only the Docuseal application's user should have access.
    4.  **External Storage (if applicable):**
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Configure Docuseal to use credentials with *only* the necessary permissions on the external storage service (e.g., read/write to a specific bucket).
    5. **Review All Settings:** Carefully review *all* of Docuseal's configuration settings (e.g., `config.yml`, `.env`, admin panel). Look for any settings related to security, data storage, access control, or authentication.  Disable any unnecessary features.
    6. **Disable Unused Features:** If Docuseal has features you don't need (e.g., certain integrations, optional modules), disable them to reduce the attack surface.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Document Access (High Severity):** Prevents direct access to stored documents.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Secure storage and backups (configured externally) are crucial.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Secure database configuration limits the impact.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced. This is a *fundamental* security layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Examine Docuseal's configuration files for storage settings.
    *   Check database user permissions (if applicable).
    *   Inspect filesystem permissions (if applicable).
    *   Review external storage credentials (if applicable).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If Docuseal uses default or overly permissive credentials, this is a *critical* vulnerability.
    *   If filesystem permissions are too broad, this is a *critical* vulnerability.
    *   If external storage credentials have excessive permissions, this is a *critical* vulnerability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Within Docuseal Templates)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__within_docuseal_templates_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure Docuseal properly validates and sanitizes all user-provided data used *within* document templates and dynamic content.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Identify all places within Docuseal's template creation and document generation process where user input is used (form fields, variables, etc.).
    2.  **Define Allowed Input:** For *each* input field, define the expected data type and any constraints (length, allowed characters, format).
    3.  **Validate (Within Docuseal):**  If Docuseal provides mechanisms for input validation (e.g., field type settings, validation rules), use them to enforce the defined constraints.
    4.  **Sanitize (Within Docuseal):** If Docuseal offers sanitization options (e.g., HTML escaping for text fields), use them appropriately.
    5.  **Template Engine Security:** If Docuseal uses a templating engine, ensure it's configured securely and automatically escapes output to prevent XSS.  Refer to the templating engine's documentation.
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all input fields within Docuseal with valid and invalid data, including potential attack payloads.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents injecting malicious JavaScript into documents.
    *   **Template Injection (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents manipulating the template itself.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks (Severity Varies):** Mitigates potential injection vulnerabilities depending on how Docuseal uses input.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS and Template Injection:** Risk significantly reduced if Docuseal handles input securely.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Impact mitigated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Examine Docuseal's template creation interface and documentation for validation/sanitization options.
    *   Review the templating engine used (if any) and its security settings.
    *   Inspect generated documents for signs of proper escaping.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If Docuseal lacks built-in validation/sanitization, this is a *major* concern.  You might need to rely on external validation (before data reaches Docuseal) or consider modifying Docuseal's code (if open-source and you have the expertise).
    *   If validation is weak or incomplete, this is a significant risk.
    *   If HTML escaping is not used consistently, this is a significant XSS risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging (Within Docuseal)](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging__within_docuseal_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and regularly review Docuseal's *built-in* audit logs.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Enable Logging:** Find Docuseal's logging settings (usually in the configuration or admin panel). Enable detailed logging of all relevant actions.
    2.  **Log Format:** Ensure the logs include sufficient information: timestamp, user ID, IP address, action performed, document ID, success/failure status.
    3.  **Log Storage:** Determine where Docuseal stores its logs (file, database). Ensure the logs are protected from unauthorized access and modification.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Regularly (e.g., daily or weekly) review the Docuseal audit logs. Look for any suspicious activity, errors, or anomalies.
    5.  **Alerting (Ideally):** If Docuseal supports it, configure alerts for specific events (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, modifications to critical templates).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Helps detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium to High Severity):** Provides a record of user actions for accountability.

    *   Examine the log files (if accessible) to see what information is recorded.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If Docuseal lacks built-in audit logging, this is a *significant* deficiency. Consider requesting this feature or exploring workarounds (e.g., database triggers, if Docuseal uses a database).
    *   If logging is enabled but not reviewed regularly, this reduces its effectiveness.
    *   If logs lack sufficient detail, this hinders investigations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Docuseal's Authentication and Session Management](./mitigation_strategies/docuseal's_authentication_and_session_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure and utilize Docuseal's built-in authentication and session management features securely.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Strong Passwords (Within Docuseal):** If Docuseal manages its own user accounts, enforce strong password policies *within Docuseal's settings* (minimum length, complexity, expiration).
    2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (If Supported):** If Docuseal offers MFA, *enable and require it*, especially for administrative accounts.
    3.  **Session Settings:** Review Docuseal's session management settings (usually in the configuration or admin panel):
        *   **HTTPS Only:** Ensure Docuseal is configured to *only* operate over HTTPS.
        *   **Secure Cookies:** Ensure the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags are set for session cookies (Docuseal should handle this automatically, but verify).
        *   **Session Timeout:** Configure a reasonable session timeout (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity).
        *   **Session ID Generation:** Docuseal should use a strong, cryptographically secure random number generator for session IDs.
    4. **External Authentication (If Supported):** If Docuseal supports integration with external identity providers (IdPs) via SAML or OpenID Connect, configure this integration *securely*, following best practices for the chosen protocol.
