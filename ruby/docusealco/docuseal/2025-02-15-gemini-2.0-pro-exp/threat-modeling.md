# Threat Model Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Threat: [Unauthorized Document Access via API Bypass](./threats/unauthorized_document_access_via_api_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Document Access via API Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly calls Docuseal's API endpoints, bypassing the intended user interface and workflow logic, to access documents they are not authorized to view. They might achieve this by analyzing network traffic, reverse-engineering the application, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the API authentication/authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach; unauthorized access to sensitive document content and metadata. Potential for data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal API endpoints (e.g., `/api/documents`, `/api/submissions`), authentication and authorization logic within the API controllers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust API authentication using strong, expiring tokens (JWTs, etc.).
        *   Enforce strict authorization checks *within each API endpoint*, verifying the user's permissions against the requested resource (document ID, submission ID, etc.). Do not rely solely on UI-level checks.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on all API parameters to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Use an API gateway to centralize security policies and rate limiting.
        *   Regularly conduct penetration testing specifically targeting the API.

## Threat: [Document Tampering via Workflow Manipulation](./threats/document_tampering_via_workflow_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Document Tampering via Workflow Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Docuseal's workflow engine to modify a document after it has been submitted or signed, or to skip required approval steps. This could involve manipulating API calls, exploiting race conditions, or injecting malicious data into the workflow process.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of document integrity; potential legal and financial repercussions due to altered contracts or agreements. Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's workflow engine (likely implemented as a series of database operations and state transitions), API endpoints related to workflow actions (e.g., `/api/submissions/{id}/approve`, `/api/submissions/{id}/reject`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong validation of all workflow actions, ensuring that the user performing the action has the necessary permissions and that the action is valid within the current workflow state.
        *   Use database transactions to ensure that workflow operations are atomic and consistent.
        *   Implement optimistic locking or other concurrency control mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
        *   Digitally sign documents at each stage of the workflow to detect tampering.
        *   Thoroughly test the workflow engine for edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Document Fields](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_document_fields.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Document Fields

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a document field (e.g., a text field, a comment field) that is not properly sanitized by Docuseal. When another user views the document, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their session cookies, redirecting them to a malicious site, or defacing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts; potential for session hijacking; data theft; defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's document rendering engine (how it displays documents in the browser), input handling for document fields (specifically, the lack of proper sanitization). Potentially affects any component that displays user-provided data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict output encoding (escaping) of all user-provided data when rendering it in the browser. Use a context-aware encoding library (e.g., OWASP's Java Encoder Project, or equivalent for other languages).
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts within the document context. This provides a defense-in-depth mechanism.
        *   Implement input validation, but *do not rely solely on it* for XSS prevention. Output encoding is the primary defense.
        *   Consider using a templating engine that automatically handles output encoding.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Search or Filtering](./threats/sql_injection_via_search_or_filtering.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Search or Filtering

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input in Docuseal's search or filtering functionality to inject SQL code into the database query. This could allow them to bypass authentication, retrieve arbitrary data (including documents), modify data, or even execute commands on the database server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise; data exfiltration; data modification; potential for remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's database access layer (ORM or direct SQL queries), specifically the code that handles search and filtering functionality (e.g., functions that build SQL queries based on user input).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
        *   If using an ORM, ensure it is configured to use parameterized queries by default and that you are not bypassing this protection.
        *   Implement input validation to restrict the characters allowed in search and filter parameters, but *do not rely solely on it* for SQL injection prevention.
        *   Use a least privilege database user account with limited permissions.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Docuseal's dependencies (e.g., a JavaScript library, a Ruby gem, a Python package) to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from data breaches to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Docuseal component that uses the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Use a dependency management system (e.g., npm, Bundler, pip) to ensure consistent and secure dependency versions.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the dependencies used by Docuseal.
