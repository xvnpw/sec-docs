# Attack Surface Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Document Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_document_access.md)

*Description:* Gaining access to documents stored within Docuseal without proper authorization.
*How Docuseal Contributes:* Docuseal's core function is document storage and management; its access control mechanisms are directly responsible for preventing this.
*Example:* An attacker guesses a document ID or exploits a flaw in Docuseal's access control logic to download a confidential contract.
*Impact:* Leakage of sensitive information, potential legal and financial repercussions, reputational damage.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Implement strong, unpredictable document identifiers (UUIDs). Enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).  Validate session management rigorously.  Implement robust input validation to prevent direct object reference vulnerabilities. Conduct regular penetration testing focused on document access.

## Attack Surface: [Document Tampering (Pre and Post-Signing)](./attack_surfaces/document_tampering__pre_and_post-signing_.md)

*Description:* Modifying the content or metadata of documents stored in Docuseal, either before or after they have been signed.
*How Docuseal Contributes:* Docuseal handles the entire document lifecycle, including storage and modification before signing; its file handling and storage logic are directly involved.
*Example:* An attacker uploads a malicious document disguised as a legitimate one, or modifies an existing document (via a vulnerability in Docuseal's code) to alter its terms.
*Impact:*  Invalidation of contracts, legal disputes, financial loss, reputational damage.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Implement strong input validation on all document uploads and modifications.  Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to verify document integrity before and after storage.  Consider applying digital signatures *before* storage to detect pre-signing tampering.  Implement robust audit logging of all document modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Signature Implementation / Bypass](./attack_surfaces/weak_signature_implementation__bypass.md)

*Description:* Exploiting weaknesses in Docuseal's digital signature process to forge signatures, bypass verification, or submit unsigned documents.
*How Docuseal Contributes:* Docuseal's core functionality relies on digital signatures for document validity; the implementation of the signing and verification process is entirely within Docuseal's code.
*Example:* An attacker uses an outdated cryptographic library (within Docuseal's code) with known vulnerabilities to forge a signature, or exploits a flaw in Docuseal's verification logic to bypass signature checks.
*Impact:*  Invalidation of contracts, legal disputes, financial loss, loss of trust in the system.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA-2048 or higher, ECDSA with appropriate curves).  Ensure secure key generation and storage (consider HSMs).  Implement robust signature verification logic that strictly enforces all checks.  Regularly review and update cryptographic libraries *used within Docuseal*.  Conduct penetration testing focused on the signature process.

## Attack Surface: [Form Field Manipulation (in Builder)](./attack_surfaces/form_field_manipulation__in_builder_.md)

*Description:* Injecting malicious code or data into form field definitions within the Docuseal builder, leading to execution when the form is rendered or processed.
*How Docuseal Contributes:* Docuseal's builder allows users to create custom forms; the code that handles form definition, storage, and rendering is entirely within Docuseal.
*Example:* An attacker creates a form field (using Docuseal's builder) with a malicious JavaScript payload that steals user cookies when the form is rendered.
*Impact:*  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, data theft, session hijacking, potential compromise of user accounts.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on *all* form field definitions (not just submitted data) *within the builder's code*.  Use output encoding when rendering forms.  Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the execution of injected scripts.  Regularly review and update any libraries used for form building and rendering *within Docuseal*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_endpoints.md)

*Description:*  Vulnerabilities in Docuseal's API endpoints, leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
*How Docuseal Contributes:* Docuseal may expose API endpoints for integration; the security of these endpoints is entirely dependent on Docuseal's code.
*Example:* An attacker exploits an unauthenticated API endpoint (provided by Docuseal) to create or modify documents.
*Impact:*  Data breach, unauthorized access to Docuseal functionality, potential compromise of integrated systems.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:*  Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints *within Docuseal's code*.  Conduct thorough security testing of the API, including fuzzing and penetration testing.  Implement rate limiting and input validation on API requests.
