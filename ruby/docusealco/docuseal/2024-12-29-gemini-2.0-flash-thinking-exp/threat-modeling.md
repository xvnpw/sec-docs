### High and Critical Docuseal Specific Threats

Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats that directly involve the Docuseal platform:

**Critical Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Docuseal API Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the API keys used by our application to authenticate with the Docuseal API. This could happen through insecure storage of the keys. The attacker can then impersonate our application and make arbitrary API calls to Docuseal.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to retrieve, modify, or delete documents stored within Docuseal.
        *   Ability to initiate fraudulent signing requests.
        *   Exposure of sensitive document data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal API Authentication Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store API keys using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement proper access controls for accessing API keys.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Docuseal's Document Storage Security
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within Docuseal's infrastructure or code could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to documents stored on their platform.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Large-scale data breach exposing confidential documents.
        *   Legal and regulatory repercussions due to data privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal Document Storage Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review Docuseal's security documentation and certifications.
        *   Understand Docuseal's data encryption practices.
        *   Have a data breach response plan in place.

**High Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Docuseal Webhooks leading to Data Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Our application exposes a webhook endpoint to receive notifications from Docuseal. If this endpoint is not properly secured and validated, an attacker could send forged webhook requests, tricking our application into believing false information about document signing status.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data integrity issues within our application's records.
        *   Potential for business logic flaws based on falsified webhook data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal Webhook Delivery Mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and verification mechanisms for incoming webhooks from Docuseal (e.g., using shared secrets or signature verification).
        *   Thoroughly validate the data received in webhook requests.
        *   Use HTTPS for the webhook endpoint.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on API Communication
    *   **Description:** If the communication between our application and the Docuseal API is not properly secured with HTTPS, an attacker on the network could intercept the traffic, potentially stealing API keys or sensitive document data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of API keys, leading to unauthorized access.
        *   Theft of sensitive document content during transmission.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network Communication Layer between Our Application and Docuseal API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all communication with the Docuseal API is conducted over HTTPS.

*   **Threat:** Inadequate Access Controls within Docuseal leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** If Docuseal's access control mechanisms are not granular enough or are misconfigured, users could gain access to documents they are not authorized to view or sign within the Docuseal platform.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized viewing or modification of sensitive documents within Docuseal.
        *   Compromise of confidentiality and integrity of documents.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal Access Control Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure Docuseal's access control settings.
        *   Regularly review and audit access permissions within Docuseal.
        *   Utilize Docuseal's role-based access control (RBAC) features effectively.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Docuseal's Signature Verification Process
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how Docuseal verifies digital signatures could potentially allow for forged or manipulated signatures to be considered valid.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Legal challenges to the authenticity and integrity of signed documents processed by Docuseal.
        *   Financial losses or other damages due to reliance on fraudulent signatures.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docuseal Signature Verification Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review Docuseal's documentation on their signature verification process and security measures.
        *   Understand the cryptographic algorithms and standards used by Docuseal for signing.
