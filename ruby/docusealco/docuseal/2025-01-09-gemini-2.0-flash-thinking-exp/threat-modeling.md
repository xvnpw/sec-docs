# Threat Model Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Threat: [Insecure Document Storage at Docuseal](./threats/insecure_document_storage_at_docuseal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Docuseal's storage infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities in their systems. They might use techniques like exploiting misconfigurations, software vulnerabilities, or social engineering targeting Docuseal's infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Confidential documents processed through our application are exposed, leading to data breaches, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and potential financial losses.
*   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's Document Storage Module/Infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review Docuseal's security documentation and practices regarding data storage.
    *   Inquire about Docuseal's security certifications and audit reports.
    *   If possible, explore Docuseal's self-hosted options for greater control over storage.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before sending it to Docuseal if their storage security is a concern and they offer compatible decryption mechanisms.

## Threat: [Data Breach at Docuseal](./threats/data_breach_at_docuseal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully breaches Docuseal's overall system, potentially gaining access to databases, application servers, and other critical infrastructure, leading to the exposure of all data within their environment, including our documents.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale exposure of sensitive documents, potentially affecting many users and organizations. Severe reputational damage, significant legal and financial repercussions.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire Docuseal Platform.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose reputable vendors with strong security track records and incident response plans.
    *   Stay informed about Docuseal's security updates and any reported breaches.
    *   Have a robust incident response plan in place to handle potential data breaches at third-party providers.
    *   Consider the legal and regulatory implications of storing data with a third-party service.

## Threat: [Weak Signature Verification](./threats/weak_signature_verification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in Docuseal's signature verification algorithms or implementation to forge or tamper with digital signatures without detection. This could involve bypassing cryptographic checks or exploiting logical errors within Docuseal's code.
*   **Impact:** Compromised document integrity, leading to invalid agreements, legal disputes, and potential financial losses due to reliance on forged signatures.
*   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's Signature Verification Function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Understand the cryptographic algorithms and standards used by Docuseal for signature verification.
    *   Inquire about independent security audits of Docuseal's signature verification process.
    *   If possible, implement secondary verification mechanisms on our end for critical documents.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Signing Workflow](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_signing_workflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication occurring within Docuseal's infrastructure during the signing process. This could involve compromising Docuseal's internal network or exploiting vulnerabilities in their internal communication protocols, potentially manipulating the data exchanged, including document content or signature information.
*   **Impact:** Compromised signing process, potentially leading to unauthorized signatures or modifications to documents during transit within Docuseal's systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Communication channels within Docuseal's API/Services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Docuseal's implementation of secure internal communication protocols.
    *   Inquire about Docuseal's internal network security measures.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Docuseal's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_docuseal's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Docuseal relies on third-party libraries and software. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise Docuseal's system, directly affecting our data and processes handled by Docuseal.
*   **Impact:** Potential data breaches, service disruptions, or other security compromises originating from Docuseal's infrastructure due to vulnerable components.
*   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's underlying libraries and software.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Docuseal's commitment to maintaining and updating their dependencies.
    *   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities affecting the technologies Docuseal likely uses (e.g., through security advisories).

## Threat: [Malicious Document Uploads Exploiting Docuseal](./threats/malicious_document_uploads_exploiting_docuseal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted document directly through Docuseal (if they allow direct uploads) or through our application's integration, exploiting a vulnerability in Docuseal's document processing logic (e.g., parsing, rendering). This could lead to denial of service or, in more severe cases, remote code execution within Docuseal's environment.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of Docuseal's service, potential data corruption within Docuseal, or, in the worst case, compromise of Docuseal's infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Docuseal's Document Processing Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Docuseal's input validation and sanitization measures for uploaded documents.
    *   If possible, perform additional validation on documents before sending them to Docuseal.
