# Attack Surface Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Document Upload](./attack_surfaces/malicious_document_upload.md)

*   **How Docuseal Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docuseal's core functionality involves handling user-uploaded documents. This introduces the risk of attackers uploading malicious files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the document processing logic *within Docuseal*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF that exploits a vulnerability in Docuseal's PDF parsing library, leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded files *within the Docuseal integration*. Utilize antivirus and malware scanning tools on uploaded documents *before they are processed by Docuseal*. Implement file size limits and restrict allowed file types based on application needs *and Docuseal's capabilities*. Employ sandboxing techniques for document processing *performed by Docuseal*.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **How Docuseal Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docuseal likely exposes API endpoints for integration. Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms *on these Docuseal-provided endpoints* can allow unauthorized access and manipulation of Docuseal functionalities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a Docuseal API endpoint to retrieve document details without proper authentication, allowing them to access sensitive information about documents managed by Docuseal.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive documents, manipulation of document workflows *within Docuseal*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper rotation) *as recommended or required by Docuseal*. Enforce granular authorization controls to ensure users can only access Docuseal resources they are permitted to. Regularly review and audit API access controls *for Docuseal's API*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Document Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_document_storage.md)

*   **How Docuseal Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docuseal needs to store uploaded documents. If *Docuseal's method of* storage is not properly secured, it becomes a prime target for attackers seeking sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** Documents processed by Docuseal are stored on the server's file system without encryption *by Docuseal*, allowing an attacker who gains access to the server to directly read sensitive content.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of confidential information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Configure Docuseal to encrypt documents at rest using strong encryption algorithms. Implement robust access controls on the storage location *used by Docuseal*. Regularly audit storage security configurations *related to Docuseal's data*. Consider using secure cloud storage solutions with built-in security features *integrated with Docuseal*.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook/Callback Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/webhookcallback_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **How Docuseal Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Docuseal uses webhooks or callback mechanisms to notify the application about events (e.g., document signed), these endpoints can be vulnerable if not properly secured *by the integrating application when receiving notifications from Docuseal*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker identifies the webhook endpoint configured for Docuseal notifications and sends malicious payloads, potentially triggering unintended actions within the application based on a forged Docuseal event.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, potential for remote code execution if the application doesn't properly handle webhook data *received from Docuseal*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and verification mechanisms for webhook requests *originating from Docuseal* (e.g., using shared secrets or digital signatures provided by Docuseal). Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received via webhooks *from Docuseal*. Avoid directly executing code based on webhook data without careful scrutiny.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Docuseal UI (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_docuseal_ui__if_applicable_.md)

*   **How Docuseal Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Docuseal provides a user interface component (e.g., for viewing or signing documents), vulnerabilities in *Docuseal's* UI could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a document field that is then rendered in the Docuseal interface, allowing them to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of other users *interacting with Docuseal*.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application *through the Docuseal interface*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure the version of Docuseal being used has proper input sanitization and output encoding techniques in *its* UI. If customizing the UI, implement proper sanitization. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded *within the context of Docuseal's UI*. Regularly update Docuseal and its UI dependencies.
