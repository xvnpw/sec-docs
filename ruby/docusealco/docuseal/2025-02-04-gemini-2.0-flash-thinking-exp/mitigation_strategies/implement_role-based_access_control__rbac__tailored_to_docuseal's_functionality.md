#### 4.2. Effectiveness Against Threats

*   **Unauthorized Access to Docuseal Features and Data (High Severity):** **Highly Effective.** RBAC directly addresses this threat by ensuring that users are only granted access to the features and data they are authorized to use based on their assigned roles. Granular permissions prevent lateral movement and unauthorized data access.
*   **Privilege Escalation within Docuseal (Medium Severity):** **Moderately to Highly Effective.** RBAC significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation by explicitly defining roles and limiting permissions.  It becomes much harder for a standard user to gain administrative privileges if RBAC is properly implemented and enforced. However, vulnerabilities in the RBAC implementation itself or misconfigurations could still be exploited for privilege escalation.
*   **Data Integrity Issues in Docuseal (Medium Severity):** **Moderately Effective.** RBAC helps protect data integrity by controlling who can modify or delete documents and configurations. By limiting write access to authorized roles, the risk of accidental or malicious data alteration is reduced. However, RBAC alone might not prevent all data integrity issues (e.g., application bugs).

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

*   **Unauthorized Access to Docuseal Features and Data:** **Significantly Reduces Risk.**  RBAC is a fundamental security control for mitigating unauthorized access.
*   **Privilege Escalation within Docuseal:** **Moderately Reduces Risk.** RBAC makes privilege escalation attacks significantly more difficult, but ongoing vigilance and secure implementation are necessary.
*   **Data Integrity Issues in Docuseal:** **Moderately Reduces Risk.** RBAC provides a layer of protection against unauthorized data modification, contributing to data integrity.
*   **Development Effort:** **High.** Implementing RBAC, especially in an existing application, requires substantial development effort, including code modifications, testing, and documentation.
*   **Maintenance Overhead:** **Medium.** Ongoing maintenance is required for RBAC, including role and permission reviews, updates, and user role management.
*   **Usability:** **Potentially Minimal Impact (Positive if done well).** If implemented correctly, RBAC should be transparent to authorized users and improve usability by streamlining access to relevant features. Poorly implemented RBAC can hinder usability by being overly restrictive or confusing.
*   **Security Posture:** **Significantly Improved.** RBAC is a crucial security enhancement that significantly strengthens Docuseal's overall security posture.

#### 4.4. Implementation Considerations and Challenges
