# Attack Surface Analysis for docusealco/docuseal

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Upload](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to the application.
*   **Docuseal Contribution:** Docuseal's core document upload feature for signing and management directly enables this attack vector, making it a primary concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file designed to exploit a vulnerability in Docuseal's PDF processing library, leading to Remote Code Execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Cross-Site Scripting, Data Exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement rigorous file validation (type, magic number, extension).
        *   Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially malicious content.
        *   Utilize secure and updated document parsing libraries.
        *   Enforce strict file size limits.
        *   Sandbox document processing to isolate potential exploits.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Document Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/document_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within document parsing libraries are exploited via crafted documents.
*   **Docuseal Contribution:** Docuseal relies on parsing libraries to process uploaded documents for rendering, signing, and content extraction, making it directly vulnerable to flaws in these libraries.
*   **Example:** A crafted DOCX file exploits a buffer overflow in Docuseal's DOCX parsing library, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Docuseal server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Employ well-maintained and actively patched document parsing libraries.
        *   Keep parsing libraries updated to the latest security versions.
        *   Validate and sanitize input before parsing.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerization for parsing processes.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of document processing.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Access Control on Documents](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_access_control_on_documents.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized users gain access to sensitive documents due to flawed access controls.
*   **Docuseal Contribution:** Docuseal's document management and user permission system is central to its security. Weak or flawed access control directly exposes sensitive documents.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Docuseal's permission logic allows a standard user to access and download confidential documents intended only for administrators or users in different departments.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Tampering, Unauthorized Actions, Confidentiality Violation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Thoroughly test access control mechanisms for privilege escalation.
        *   Regularly audit access control configurations and user permissions.
        *   Implement logging and monitoring of document access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Signature Forgery or Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/signature_forgery_or_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Digital signatures can be forged or manipulated, undermining document integrity and trust.
*   **Docuseal Contribution:** Docuseal's core function is digital document signing. Vulnerabilities in its signature implementation directly compromise the fundamental security promise of the application.
*   **Example:** A flaw in Docuseal's signature verification process allows an attacker to subtly alter a signed document while the signature still validates as legitimate, or to create a valid signature without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Integrity Violation, Repudiation of Signatures, Legal and Business Consequences, Financial Loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize established and secure digital signature libraries and standards.
        *   Implement strong signature verification processes.
        *   Ensure secure management of cryptographic keys and certificates (consider HSMs).
        *   Regularly audit signature implementation and cryptographic components.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Docuseal is deployed with insecure default settings, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Docuseal Contribution:** If Docuseal ships with weak default configurations (e.g., default admin credentials), it directly creates a readily exploitable entry point for attackers.
*   **Example:** Docuseal is deployed with default administrator credentials that are publicly known or easily guessable. An attacker uses these credentials to gain administrative access and compromise the entire Docuseal instance.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, System Compromise, Data Breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid shipping with default credentials.
        *   Force users to set strong, unique credentials during initial setup.
        *   Disable debug mode and unnecessary features by default in production.
        *   Provide clear and comprehensive secure configuration guidelines.
        *   Harden default configurations based on security best practices.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Immediately change all default credentials upon installation.
        *   Review and harden default configurations according to security guidelines.
        *   Disable any unnecessary features or services.
