## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Document Uploads](./mitigation_strategies/robust_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_document_uploads.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Document Uploads
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement File Type Whitelisting in Docuseal:** Configure Docuseal to strictly validate uploaded file extensions against a predefined whitelist of allowed document types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.odt`) within its upload handling logic. Reject any files with extensions not on the whitelist directly in Docuseal's backend.
    2.  **File Size Limits in Docuseal:** Configure and enforce maximum file size limits for document uploads specifically within Docuseal's settings or code to prevent denial-of-service attacks targeting Docuseal's resources.
    3.  **Content Type Inspection (Magic Number Validation) in Docuseal:** Integrate magic number validation into Docuseal's file upload processing. Use libraries within Docuseal's backend to inspect the file's "magic number" to verify the actual file type, preventing users from bypassing extension checks.
    4.  **Document Content Sanitization within Docuseal:**  Employ dedicated document parsing and sanitization libraries within Docuseal's backend to process uploaded documents. Configure these libraries within Docuseal to remove or neutralize potentially malicious elements such as embedded scripts or macros before further processing or storage by Docuseal.
    5.  **Secure Error Handling in Docuseal Uploads:** Implement secure error handling specifically in Docuseal's document upload and validation components. Avoid displaying verbose error messages to users that could reveal Docuseal's internal validation logic. Log detailed errors securely for Docuseal debugging purposes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Uploading executable files disguised as documents or files exploiting vulnerabilities in document processing libraries to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or gain unauthorized access *to Docuseal or its server*.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Document Content (Medium Severity):** Injecting malicious scripts into document content that could be executed in a user's browser when Docuseal previews or downloads the document, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement *within the Docuseal application context*.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Documents (Medium Severity):** Uploading specially crafted documents designed to consume excessive Docuseal server resources during processing, leading to service disruption *of Docuseal*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Docuseal Server and Application Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/harden_docuseal_server_and_application_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Harden Docuseal Server and Application Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Harden Docuseal Application Configuration:**  Review and harden Docuseal's application configuration settings. Disable unnecessary features or modules in Docuseal. Configure Docuseal with secure defaults and follow security best practices for application configuration.
    2.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege to Docuseal Application:** Apply the principle of least privilege to Docuseal's application configuration. Grant only necessary permissions to Docuseal application components and limit access to sensitive resources.
    3.  **Securely Manage Docuseal Application Credentials:** Securely manage credentials used by Docuseal, such as database credentials, API keys, and service account credentials. Avoid hardcoding credentials in Docuseal's code or configuration files. Use environment variables or secure configuration management solutions to manage Docuseal credentials.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities in Docuseal (Medium Severity):** Insecure Docuseal application configuration can introduce vulnerabilities such as exposed administrative interfaces, default credentials, or overly permissive access controls, which attackers can exploit.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Docuseal Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Misconfigured Docuseal application settings could potentially allow attackers to escalate their privileges within Docuseal.
    *   **Credential Exposure in Docuseal (High Severity):** If Docuseal application credentials are not securely managed, they could be exposed, leading to unauthorized access to Docuseal's backend systems or data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities in Docuseal: Moderately Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from insecure Docuseal application configuration.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Docuseal Misconfiguration: Moderately Reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks exploiting Docuseal misconfigurations.
    *   Credential Exposure in Docuseal: Significantly Reduces the risk of credential exposure within Docuseal.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Basic secure configuration practices might be followed during Docuseal deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A systematic approach to hardening Docuseal application configuration, applying the principle of least privilege to Docuseal, and securely managing Docuseal application credentials using dedicated solutions are likely missing. This should be implemented as part of Docuseal's deployment and configuration management process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Manage Docuseal Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/securely_manage_docuseal_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Manage Docuseal Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Docuseal Configuration Files:** Protect Docuseal configuration files from unauthorized access. Set appropriate file system permissions to restrict read and write access to Docuseal configuration files to only authorized users and processes.
    2.  **Avoid Storing Sensitive Information Directly in Docuseal Configuration Files:** Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys, encryption keys) directly in Docuseal configuration files.
    3.  **Use Environment Variables or Secure Configuration Management for Docuseal:** Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage sensitive configuration parameters for Docuseal instead of storing them in configuration files.
    4.  **Encrypt Docuseal Configuration Files at Rest (Optional):** Consider encrypting Docuseal configuration files at rest for an additional layer of security, especially if they contain sensitive information (though it's best to avoid storing sensitive data in config files in the first place).
    5.  **Version Control Docuseal Configuration Files:** Use version control systems to track changes to Docuseal configuration files. Review changes to configuration files for security implications before deploying them.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Docuseal Configuration Files (High Severity):** If Docuseal configuration files are not properly secured, sensitive information stored in them (e.g., credentials, keys) could be exposed to unauthorized users, leading to account compromise or data breaches.
    *   **Tampering with Docuseal Configuration (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized modification of Docuseal configuration files could lead to misconfiguration vulnerabilities, denial of service, or other security issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information in Docuseal Configuration Files: Significantly Reduces the risk of sensitive information exposure from Docuseal configuration files.
    *   Tampering with Docuseal Configuration: Moderately Reduces the risk of unauthorized configuration changes affecting Docuseal security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Basic file system permissions might be in place for Docuseal configuration files.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Strict access control to Docuseal configuration files, avoiding storage of sensitive information in config files, using environment variables or secure configuration management for Docuseal, and version controlling Docuseal configuration files are likely missing or not fully implemented. This should be implemented as part of Docuseal's deployment and configuration management practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Audits and Monitoring
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Periodic Security Audits of Docuseal:** Conduct periodic security audits specifically of Docuseal's configuration, code, and infrastructure to identify and address potential security weaknesses in Docuseal.
    2.  **Automated Security Monitoring for Docuseal:** Implement automated security monitoring for Docuseal to detect and respond to suspicious activities and security incidents in a timely manner. Use security information and event management (SIEM) systems or other monitoring tools to monitor Docuseal logs and security events.
    3.  **Security Incident Response Plan for Docuseal:** Develop and maintain a security incident response plan specifically for Docuseal. Define procedures for responding to security incidents affecting Docuseal, including incident detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
    4.  **Regular Review of Docuseal Security Posture:** Regularly review Docuseal's overall security posture, including the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies, the results of security audits and testing, and the evolving threat landscape relevant to Docuseal.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Security Weaknesses in Docuseal (Medium Severity):** Without regular security audits and monitoring, security weaknesses in Docuseal might go undetected, increasing the risk of exploitation.
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response for Docuseal (High Severity):** Lack of security monitoring can lead to delays in detecting and responding to security incidents affecting Docuseal, potentially increasing the impact of breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Undetected Security Weaknesses in Docuseal: Moderately Reduces the risk of undetected security weaknesses by proactively identifying and addressing them through audits.
    *   Delayed Incident Detection and Response for Docuseal: Significantly Reduces the impact of security incidents affecting Docuseal by enabling faster detection and response.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Basic system monitoring might be in place, but dedicated security audits and monitoring specifically for Docuseal are likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regular security audits of Docuseal, automated security monitoring for Docuseal, a dedicated security incident response plan for Docuseal, and regular review of Docuseal's security posture are likely missing. This should be implemented as a core part of Docuseal's ongoing security management.
