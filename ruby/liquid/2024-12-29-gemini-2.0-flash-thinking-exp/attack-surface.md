* **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Liquid code into templates, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid's ability to execute code within templates based on provided data makes it vulnerable if user-controlled data influences the template or its context without proper sanitization.
    * **Example:** An application renders a template using user-provided data directly: `{{ user_provided_string }}`. If `user_provided_string` is `{% assign danger = 'system' %}{{ danger._ }}` (a simplified example, actual exploits can be more complex), it could lead to code execution depending on the underlying system and Liquid's configuration.
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization and Escaping:**  Thoroughly sanitize and escape all user-provided data before incorporating it into Liquid templates.
        * **Avoid Dynamic Template Generation with User Input:**  Minimize or eliminate scenarios where user input directly dictates the structure or content of Liquid templates.
        * **Use a Secure Templating Context:**  Limit the objects and methods accessible within the Liquid template context to only what is absolutely necessary.
        * **Consider Sandboxing:**  If possible, run Liquid rendering in a sandboxed environment to restrict the impact of potential exploits.
        * **Regular Security Audits:**  Review template code and data flow for potential injection points.

* **Attack Surface:** Data Exposure through Unintended Variable Access
    * **Description:** Sensitive data is unintentionally exposed through Liquid variables within templates.
    * **How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid's variable resolution mechanism can inadvertently expose data if developers make too much information available in the template context or don't properly filter sensitive data.
    * **Example:** A developer makes a database connection object directly available in the Liquid context: `{{ db_connection.password }}`. If this template is rendered, the database password would be exposed.
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Template Context:**  Only provide the necessary data to the template context. Avoid exposing entire objects or datasets when only specific attributes are needed.
        * **Careful Data Filtering and Transformation:**  Filter and transform data before making it available in the template to remove sensitive information.
        * **Regular Review of Template Context:**  Periodically review the data being passed to Liquid templates to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed.

* **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Liquid Tags or Filters
    * **Description:** Security flaws in custom Liquid tags or filters introduced by developers can create new attack vectors.
    * **How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid's extensibility allows developers to create custom tags and filters, but vulnerabilities in their implementation can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A custom filter that executes shell commands based on its input without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can be High or Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Extensions:**  Follow secure coding principles when developing custom Liquid tags and filters.
        * **Thorough Testing and Code Review:**  Conduct rigorous testing and code reviews of custom Liquid extensions to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization within Custom Logic:**  Ensure that all inputs to custom tags and filters are properly validated and sanitized.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Custom Logic:**  Limit the permissions and capabilities of custom Liquid extensions to only what is necessary.
