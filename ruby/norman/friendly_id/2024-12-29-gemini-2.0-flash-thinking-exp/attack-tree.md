Title: High-Risk Threat Sub-Tree: Exploiting `friendly_id`

Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access to resources or manipulate data by exploiting `friendly_id`'s slug handling.

Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Exploit Slug Generation Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)
  - Description: Attackers target flaws in how slugs are generated to predict or manipulate them.
  - Critical Node: This node is critical because successful exploitation opens avenues for unauthorized access and data manipulation.
  - Attack Vector: Predictable Slug Generation
    - Goal: Access sensitive resource by guessing slug (CRITICAL NODE)
      - Description: If slugs are predictable, attackers can guess valid slugs for sensitive resources.
      - Likelihood: Medium (if simple generators are used)
      - Impact: High (access to sensitive data/functionality)
      - Effort: Low to Medium
      - Skill Level: Low
      - Detection Difficulty: Medium
      - Mitigation: Use sufficiently random slug generation strategies, add entropy.

High-Risk Path: Exploit Slug Lookup Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)
  - Description: Attackers exploit inconsistencies or inefficiencies in how the application retrieves resources based on slugs.
  - Critical Node: This node is critical because it can lead to authorization bypass or denial of service.
  - Attack Vector: Case Sensitivity Issues
    - Goal: Bypass authorization or access control (CRITICAL NODE)
      - Description: If slug lookup is case-insensitive while authorization is case-sensitive (or vice-versa), attackers can bypass access controls.
      - Likelihood: Medium
      - Impact: Medium to High (unauthorized access)
      - Effort: Low
      - Skill Level: Low
      - Detection Difficulty: Medium
      - Mitigation: Ensure consistent case sensitivity handling throughout the application.

High-Risk Path: Exploiting Custom Slug Generators (If Used) (CRITICAL NODE)
  - Description: Attackers target vulnerabilities introduced by developers implementing custom slug generation logic.
  - Critical Node: This node is critical because custom logic is often a source of security vulnerabilities.
  - Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom Logic (CRITICAL NODE)
    - Goal: Exploit flaws in the developer-defined slug generation logic (CRITICAL NODE)
      - Description: Attackers analyze custom code for weaknesses like insufficient sanitization or lack of uniqueness checks.
      - Likelihood: Medium to High (depends on developer practices)
      - Impact: Varies (can be low to high)
      - Effort: Medium
      - Skill Level: Medium
      - Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
      - Mitigation: Thoroughly review and test custom slug generation logic, apply secure coding practices.
