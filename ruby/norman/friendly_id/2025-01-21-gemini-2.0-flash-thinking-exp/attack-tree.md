## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Predictable Slug Generation] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_predictable_slug_generation___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the FriendlyId library is configured or used in a way that generates predictable slugs (e.g., based on sequential IDs, timestamps with low granularity, or easily guessable patterns), attackers can exploit this predictability to infer or directly guess valid slugs for resources.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to unauthorized access to resources that should be protected, as attackers can bypass intended access controls by directly accessing URLs or making API requests using the guessed slugs.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Utilize strong, unpredictable slug generation strategies, such as UUIDs or random string generators with sufficient entropy.
    *   Avoid using sequential or time-based patterns without significant randomization.
    *   Implement robust authorization checks that do not rely solely on the secrecy of the slug.
    *   Consider rate-limiting requests to prevent brute-force guessing attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Guess Valid Slugs) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_guess_valid_slugs___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers actively attempt to guess valid FriendlyId slugs based on observed patterns, common formats, or brute-force attempts against the slug space.
*   **Impact:** Successful guessing can grant unauthorized access to resources or reveal sensitive information associated with the guessed slugs.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Employ unpredictable slug generation.
    *   Implement strong authorization mechanisms.
    *   Monitor for unusual access patterns or high volumes of requests for non-existent slugs.
    *   Consider using CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to deter automated guessing attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Unauthorized Access to Resources) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_unauthorized_access_to_resources___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  By successfully guessing valid slugs, attackers directly access resources (web pages, API endpoints, data records) that they are not authorized to view or interact with.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized modification of resources, or disruption of application functionality.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement and enforce proper authorization checks for all resource access, regardless of how the resource is identified (e.g., by slug).
    *   Regularly review and audit authorization rules to ensure they are correctly configured.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Insecure Slug Handling] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_insecure_slug_handling___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This encompasses vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of FriendlyId slugs within the application's code. This includes scenarios where slugs are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries or when they are displayed to users without proper encoding.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, which can have severe consequences.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs, including FriendlyId slugs, before using them in any context.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities when querying the database with slug values.
    *   Encode slugs properly before displaying them in web pages to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Slug Injection/Manipulation) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_slug_injectionmanipulation___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code or manipulate the content of FriendlyId slugs, especially if the application allows user-defined slugs or modifications to existing slugs without proper validation.
*   **Impact:** Successful injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts are executed in the browsers of other users, or Server-Side Injection attacks, where malicious code is executed on the application server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize any input that influences slug generation or modification.
    *   Implement proper output encoding when displaying slugs to prevent XSS.
    *   Avoid using slug values directly in server-side code execution contexts without thorough sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_cross-site_scripting__xss____high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If malicious scripts are injected into FriendlyId slugs and these slugs are displayed on web pages without proper encoding, the scripts will be executed in the browsers of users viewing those pages.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the application.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust output encoding for all dynamic content, including FriendlyId slugs.
    *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Server-Side Injection) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_server-side_injection___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If FriendlyId slugs are used in server-side code execution contexts (e.g., in `eval()` statements or system commands) without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid using dynamic code execution functions with user-controlled input, including FriendlyId slugs.
    *   If dynamic execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for application processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Insecure Slug Lookup) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_insecure_slug_lookup___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities arise when FriendlyId slugs are directly incorporated into database queries without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries. This allows attackers to manipulate the query structure.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or ORM features with proper escaping when querying the database using FriendlyId slugs.
    *   Avoid concatenating slug values directly into SQL query strings.
    *   Implement database access controls and the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [(SQL Injection) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_sql_injection___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting insecure slug lookup, attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries through the slug parameter.
*   **Impact:**  Full database compromise, including reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data, and potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization (although this is less effective against SQL injection than parameterized queries).
    *   Regularly scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis tools.
    *   Restrict database user permissions to the minimum necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [(Unauthorized Access/Modification) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_unauthorized_accessmodification___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  If slug collisions occur due to vulnerabilities in the application's logic or FriendlyId's configuration, attackers might be able to access or modify data associated with the unintended record.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized viewing or modification of sensitive information, or disruption of application functionality.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure that the application logic strictly enforces the uniqueness of FriendlyId slugs.
    *   Thoroughly test collision handling mechanisms.
    *   Implement safeguards to prevent the creation of duplicate slugs, even in edge cases or race conditions.
    *   Use the primary key or other unique identifiers in conjunction with the slug for critical operations to avoid ambiguity.
