## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Vulnerable Code Patterns

The core vulnerability stems from applications blindly trusting user-supplied input when determining the redirection target.  Here are common vulnerable patterns:

*   **Directly Using `params[:old_slug]`:**

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    def show
      if params[:old_slug]
        redirect_to params[:old_slug] # Open redirect!
        return
      end
      @product = Product.friendly.find(params[:id])
    end
    ```

    This is the most blatant example.  The application redirects to whatever is provided in the `old_slug` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect to any URL.

*   **Insufficient Validation:**

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE (Insufficient Validation)
    def show
      if params[:old_slug]
        if params[:old_slug].start_with?('/')
          redirect_to params[:old_slug] # Still vulnerable!
          return
        end
      end
      @product = Product.friendly.find(params[:id])
    end
    ```

    While this code attempts to validate the input, it's insufficient.  An attacker could use relative paths (e.g., `/products/old-slug?old_slug=//evil.com`) or other tricks to bypass this check.  Double slashes are often interpreted as protocol-relative URLs, leading to redirection to `evil.com`.

*   **Implicit Redirection with `friendly_id` Misuse:**

    Even if the application uses `friendly_id`'s built-in redirection features, it can still be vulnerable if not used carefully.  For example, if the application doesn't properly handle exceptions or errors during the redirection process, it might expose internal information or create unexpected behavior.  While less direct, this can still be a security concern.

*   **Overriding `friendly_id`'s Redirect Logic:**

    If the application overrides `friendly_id`'s default redirection behavior with custom logic, that custom logic must be thoroughly vetted for vulnerabilities.  Any custom redirection logic is a potential point of failure.

### 4.2. `friendly_id`'s Role

`friendly_id` itself provides a mechanism for redirection, but it's the *application's responsibility* to use this mechanism securely.  `friendly_id` doesn't inherently introduce an open redirect vulnerability; the vulnerability arises from how the application *handles* the redirection process.  The gem provides tools, but it's up to the developer to use them correctly.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Phishing:**  An attacker crafts a link like `/products/old-slug?old_slug=http://evil.com/login`.  When a user clicks this link, they are redirected to a fake login page that steals their credentials.

*   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  An attacker might use an open redirect to bypass access controls.  For example, if a certain section of the site requires authentication, an attacker might find a way to redirect the user to that section *after* they've been redirected through a vulnerable endpoint, effectively bypassing the authentication check.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Less Common, but Possible):**  In some cases, an open redirect could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve XSS.  For example, if the redirected URL contains attacker-controlled JavaScript, it might be executed in the context of the original site.

*   **Open Redirect as part of a larger attack chain:** Open redirects are rarely the final goal of an attacker. They are often used as a stepping stone in a more complex attack.

### 4.4. Mitigation Techniques

*   **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**  Maintain a list of allowed redirection targets (e.g., a list of valid routes within your application).  Before redirecting, check if the target URL is in the whitelist.  This is the most robust solution.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE (Whitelist Approach)
    ALLOWED_REDIRECTS = [
      '/products',
      '/about',
      '/contact'
    ]

    def show
      if params[:old_slug]
        target = "/products/#{params[:old_slug]}" # Construct the expected target
        if ALLOWED_REDIRECTS.include?(target) || target.start_with?('/products/') # Check against whitelist and pattern
          redirect_to target
          return
        end
      end
      @product = Product.friendly.find(params[:id])
    end
    ```

*   **Strict Pattern Matching:**  If a whitelist is not feasible, use strict pattern matching to validate the target URL.  Ensure it conforms to the expected format for your application's URLs.  Use regular expressions to enforce this.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE (Strict Pattern Matching)
    def show
      if params[:old_slug]
        if params[:old_slug] =~ /\A[a-z0-9\-]+\z/ # Only allow alphanumeric and hyphens
          redirect_to "/products/#{params[:old_slug]}"
          return
        end
      end
      @product = Product.friendly.find(params[:id])
    end
    ```

*   **Use `redirect_to` with a Model or Route Helper:**  Instead of directly using `params[:old_slug]`, use Rails' built-in helpers to generate the redirection URL.  This is generally safer, as it avoids directly manipulating user-supplied input.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE (Using Route Helper)
    def show
      if params[:old_slug]
        product = Product.friendly.find(params[:old_slug]) rescue nil
        if product
          redirect_to product # Use the model to generate the URL
          return
        end
      end
      @product = Product.friendly.find(params[:id])
    end
    ```
    This approach is safer because it relies on the model and Rails' routing system to generate the URL, rather than directly using user input.  It also handles the case where the old slug doesn't correspond to a valid product.

*   **Indirect Redirection:** Use an intermediate lookup table or database to map old slugs to new URLs.  The user-provided `old_slug` would be used as a key to retrieve the *actual* redirection target from this table.  This prevents the attacker from directly controlling the target URL.

*   **Sanitize and Encode:** If you *must* use user input in the redirection URL, sanitize and encode it properly to prevent injection attacks.  However, this is generally less secure than the other methods.

*   **Use `friendly_id`'s built-in redirection safely:** If you are relying on `friendly_id`'s built-in redirection, make sure you understand how it works and that you are not introducing any additional vulnerabilities in your application logic.  Read the documentation carefully.

### 4.5. Testing Strategies

*   **Automated Security Scans:**  Use automated web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify potential open redirect vulnerabilities.

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Have a security expert manually test the application for open redirects, trying various attack vectors.

*   **Code Audits:**  Regularly review the code, specifically focusing on redirection logic, to identify potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write unit and integration tests to verify that redirection logic works as expected and doesn't allow redirection to arbitrary URLs.  These tests should include cases with malicious input.

    ```ruby
    # Example Unit Test (RSpec)
    describe "Redirection" do
      it "does not redirect to external URLs" do
        get :show, params: { old_slug: "http://evil.com" }
        expect(response).not_to redirect_to("http://evil.com")
        expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok) # Or whatever is appropriate
      end

      it "redirects to the correct product page" do
        product = FactoryBot.create(:product, slug: "old-slug")
        product.update(slug: "new-slug")
        get :show, params: { old_slug: "old-slug" }
        expect(response).to redirect_to(product_path(product))
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to provide a wide range of unexpected inputs to the `old_slug` parameter and observe the application's behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

Redirection manipulation via slug history in `friendly_id` applications is a serious vulnerability that can lead to phishing attacks and other security breaches.  By understanding the vulnerable code patterns, exploitation scenarios, and mitigation techniques outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of open redirect vulnerabilities.  The key takeaway is to **never trust user input directly when determining redirection targets**.  Always validate the target URL using a whitelist, strict pattern matching, or indirect redirection.  Regular security testing and code reviews are crucial to ensure the ongoing security of the application.
