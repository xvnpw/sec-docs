# Deep Analysis: Bypassing `friendly_id` with ActiveRecord's `find`

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the security implications of using ActiveRecord's standard `find` method (e.g., `Model.find(id)`) instead of `friendly_id`'s intended methods (e.g., `Model.friendly.find(slug)` or `Model.find_by_slug(slug)`) within an application utilizing the `friendly_id` gem.  We aim to understand the vulnerabilities introduced, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development practices and security reviews.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where a developer, either intentionally or unintentionally, uses the raw numeric primary key ID with ActiveRecord's `find` method to retrieve records in a part of the application where `friendly_id` is intended to be used for access control and URL generation.  We will consider:

*   **Affected Components:**  Any controller actions, models, or services that interact with models configured to use `friendly_id`.
*   **Excluded Components:**  Areas of the application where `friendly_id` is *not* implemented or where direct numeric ID access is explicitly intended and secured by other means (e.g., administrative interfaces with robust authentication and authorization).
*   **Attack Surface:**  Any externally accessible endpoint (e.g., web pages, API endpoints) that could potentially be manipulated to expose numeric IDs or accept numeric IDs as input.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the codebase for instances of `Model.find(id)` where `id` might be a user-supplied or externally influenced numeric ID, particularly in controllers and views.  We will use static analysis tools and manual inspection.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify potential attack vectors based on how numeric IDs might be leaked or guessed.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose concrete steps to prevent and detect this vulnerability.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Outline testing strategies to ensure the mitigations are effective.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1

**Attack Tree Path:** 3.1 Use of `find` directly (bypassing `friendly_id`) [CRITICAL]

### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

The core vulnerability lies in the fundamental difference between how ActiveRecord's `find` and `friendly_id`'s `friendly.find` operate.

*   **`Model.find(id)`:**  This method directly queries the database using the primary key (typically an auto-incrementing integer).  It makes *no* attempt to use or validate the slug.
*   **`Model.friendly.find(slug)`:** This method (or `Model.find_by_slug(slug)`) is designed to find a record based on its slug.  It handles the lookup and, importantly, *does not* directly expose the numeric ID in URLs or user-facing interfaces.

By using `Model.find(id)`, the developer bypasses the entire purpose of `friendly_id`, which is to obscure the underlying numeric IDs and prevent direct access based on them.

### 4.2. Attack Vectors

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through several attack vectors:

1.  **ID Enumeration/Guessing:**  Since primary keys are often sequential, an attacker can systematically try different numeric IDs (e.g., `/users/1`, `/users/2`, `/users/3`) to access resources they shouldn't have access to.  This is particularly effective if the application doesn't have robust authorization checks *after* the record is retrieved.

2.  **ID Leakage:**  Numeric IDs might be leaked in various ways:
    *   **Error Messages:**  Uncaught exceptions or poorly handled errors might reveal the numeric ID in the error message displayed to the user.
    *   **Debugging Information:**  Debugging information left in production code (e.g., `console.log`, `puts`, or debugging tools) could expose IDs.
    *   **Referer Headers:**  If a page with a numeric ID in the URL links to another page, the Referer header might contain the full URL, including the ID.
    *   **API Responses:**  If an API endpoint inadvertently returns the numeric ID along with other data, an attacker can harvest these IDs.
    *   **Source Code Inspection:** If Javascript code uses numeric IDs, they can be found by inspecting the source.
    *   **Hidden Form Fields:** Numeric IDs might be stored in hidden form fields, making them easily accessible to attackers.

3.  **Parameter Tampering:**  If a form or API endpoint accepts a numeric ID as a parameter (even if it's not directly used in the URL), an attacker can modify this parameter to access different records.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenario

**Scenario:**  A blog application uses `friendly_id` for its posts.  A post's URL is `/posts/my-awesome-post` (where "my-awesome-post" is the slug).  However, a developer mistakenly uses `Post.find(params[:id])` in the `show` action of the `PostsController`.

1.  **ID Leakage:** An attacker views the source code of a blog post page and notices a hidden form field for comments that includes the post's numeric ID (e.g., `<input type="hidden" name="post_id" value="123">`).

2.  **Exploitation:** The attacker then tries URLs like `/posts/122`, `/posts/124`, etc.  If the application doesn't have proper authorization checks *within* the `show` action (beyond just retrieving the record), the attacker can view other posts, potentially including drafts or private posts, simply by changing the numeric ID.

### 4.4. Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is **Very High** because:

*   **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., private posts, user information, financial records) is possible.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the numeric ID corresponds to a user or role, an attacker might be able to access administrative functionalities or impersonate other users.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.
*   **Legal Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to legal penalties and lawsuits, especially if sensitive user data is involved.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial:

1.  **Code Review and Training:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews with a specific focus on identifying and preventing the use of `Model.find(id)` where `friendly_id` should be used.
    *   **Developer Training:**  Educate developers on the proper use of `friendly_id` and the security risks of bypassing it.  Emphasize the importance of using `friendly.find` or `find_by_slug`.

2.  **Automated Code Analysis:**
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., RuboCop with custom rules, Brakeman) to automatically detect instances of `Model.find(id)` in controllers and other sensitive areas.  Configure these tools to flag such usage as a critical security issue.

3.  **Consistent Use of `friendly_id` Methods:**
    *   **Enforce `friendly.find`:**  Wherever possible, *always* use `Model.friendly.find(params[:id])` or `Model.find_by_slug(params[:id])` in controllers.  This ensures that the slug is used for lookup.
    *   **Consider Overriding `find` (with caution):**  In the model, you *could* consider overriding the default `find` method to raise an exception or redirect to an error page if a numeric ID is passed.  This is a more aggressive approach and should be carefully considered, as it might break legitimate internal uses of `find`.  A better approach is often to use a separate method for internal lookups that require numeric IDs.

    ```ruby
    # In your model (e.g., Post.rb)
    class Post < ApplicationRecord
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :title, use: :slugged

      def self.find(*args)
        if args.first.is_a?(Integer) && caller_locations(1,1)[0].label !='find_by_id' #check that it is not called by find_by_id
          raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, "Direct numeric ID lookup is not allowed. Use friendly.find instead."
        else
          super
        end
      end
      #add safe method for internal usage
      def self.find_by_id(id)
          super(id)
      end
    end
    ```

4.  **Robust Authorization:**
    *   **Implement Authorization Checks:**  Even if a record is retrieved using `friendly.find`, always implement authorization checks *after* the record is retrieved to ensure the current user has permission to access it.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.  Use a gem like Pundit or CanCanCan for this.

5.  **Prevent ID Leakage:**
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to prevent numeric IDs from being exposed in error messages.  Use custom error pages and log errors securely.
    *   **Secure API Design:**  Ensure that API responses do not include numeric IDs unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
    *   **Review Hidden Fields:**  Carefully review the use of hidden form fields and avoid storing sensitive information like numeric IDs in them.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks that could be used to steal IDs.

6. **Input Validation:**
    * Sanitize and validate all user inputs, especially parameters that might be interpreted as IDs.

### 4.6. Testing Recommendations

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your models to ensure that `friendly.find` works correctly and that direct numeric ID lookups are either prevented or handled securely.

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests for your controllers to ensure that they use `friendly.find` and that authorization checks are in place.

3.  **Security Tests (Penetration Testing):**
    *   **ID Enumeration:**  Attempt to enumerate resources by systematically trying different numeric IDs.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:**  Try modifying parameters that might contain numeric IDs to see if you can access unauthorized data.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Trigger errors to see if any sensitive information, including numeric IDs, is leaked.

4.  **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify potential security issues, including ID leakage and insecure direct object references.

## 5. Conclusion

The use of `Model.find(id)` instead of `friendly_id`'s methods represents a critical security vulnerability.  By understanding the attack vectors and implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.  Continuous monitoring, testing, and code reviews are essential to maintain a secure application.
