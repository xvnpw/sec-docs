# Deep Analysis: Slug Collision/Prediction Attack Path (friendly_id)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with slug collision and prediction attacks when using the `friendly_id` gem, and to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities within our application's implementation and propose concrete solutions to enhance security.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **`friendly_id` Gem Configuration:**  How our application configures and uses `friendly_id`, including slug generation methods, sequence separators, and any custom slug candidates.
*   **Resource Identification:**  Which models and resources within our application utilize `friendly_id` for identification.
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**  How our application's authorization logic interacts with slug-based identification.  Are we *solely* relying on the slug for authorization, or are there additional checks?
*   **Rate Limiting and Monitoring:**  Existing mechanisms to detect and prevent brute-force or enumeration attempts targeting slugs.
*   **Data Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of the data accessible via resources identified by slugs.  A collision on a user profile slug is far more critical than a collision on a blog post category slug.
* **Database uniqueness constraints:** How database is configured to handle uniqueness of slugs.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ the following methods to conduct this analysis:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the application's codebase, focusing on:
    *   Model definitions using `friendly_id`.
    *   Controller actions that retrieve resources based on slugs.
    *   Authorization logic (e.g., using gems like Pundit, CanCanCan).
    *   Routes configuration.
    *   Any custom slug generation logic.

2.  **Configuration Review:**  Analysis of `friendly_id` configuration files (e.g., initializers) and environment variables.

3.  **Penetration Testing (Simulated Attacks):**  We will simulate various attack scenarios, including:
    *   **Brute-force attempts:** Trying to guess existing slugs using common patterns and short sequences.
    *   **Incremental slug generation:**  Attempting to predict the next slug in a sequence.
    *   **Collision attempts:**  Creating new resources with slugs designed to collide with existing ones (if possible).
    *   **Timing attacks:**  Measuring response times to potentially identify subtle differences between valid and invalid slugs (though this is less likely with `friendly_id` than with custom implementations).

4.  **Database Schema Review:** Examining the database schema to confirm the presence and enforcement of unique constraints on slug columns.

5.  **Log Analysis (if available):** Reviewing application logs for any suspicious activity related to slug access, such as repeated requests with similar slugs or a high volume of 404 errors.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Slug Collision/Prediction

**4.1. Threat Model:**

*   **Attacker Goal:**  Gain unauthorized access to a resource by guessing or forcing a collision with its slug.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker may have:
    *   Knowledge of common slug patterns.
    *   The ability to create new resources (if applicable).
    *   Tools for automated brute-force attacks.
    *   Limited or no prior knowledge of existing slugs.

**4.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The `friendly_id` gem itself provides several defenses against slug collisions, but misconfiguration or improper usage can introduce vulnerabilities.  Here's a breakdown of potential issues:

*   **4.2.1. Weak Slug Generation:**
    *   **Problem:** If the application uses a very short or predictable base for slugs (e.g., just the resource ID, a short title), it becomes easier to guess.  `friendly_id`'s default behavior of truncating long strings can also lead to collisions if many resources have similar starting characters.
    *   **Example:** If slugs are generated solely from a sequential `id`, an attacker could easily enumerate resources (e.g., `/users/1`, `/users/2`, `/users/3`).  Even if the ID is converted to a string, it's still predictable.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a sufficiently long and descriptive base for the slug (e.g., a combination of title, creation date, and a random component).
        *   Utilize `friendly_id`'s `candidates` feature to provide multiple slug options, increasing the chance of finding a unique one.  For example:
            ```ruby
            friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged

            def slug_candidates
              [
                :title,
                [:title, :id], # Use title and ID if title is not unique
                [:title, :created_at_string], # Use title and formatted creation date
                [:title, SecureRandom.hex(4)] # Use title and a random hex string
              ]
            end

            def created_at_string
                created_at.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
            end
            ```
        *   Avoid using only the resource ID as the slug base.

*   **4.2.2. Insufficient Sequence Separator:**
    *   **Problem:**  `friendly_id` uses a sequence separator (default: `--`) to handle collisions.  If the separator is predictable or easily guessable, an attacker might try to create collisions by appending variations of the separator.  This is less of a concern with the default `--`, but could be an issue with custom, simpler separators.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Stick with the default `--` separator.
        *   If a custom separator is absolutely necessary, ensure it's sufficiently complex and not easily guessable (e.g., include special characters, numbers, and letters).

*   **4.2.3. Lack of Database Uniqueness Constraints:**
    *   **Problem:**  Even with `friendly_id`'s collision handling, a race condition could occur where two resources are created simultaneously with the same slug *before* the sequence separator is applied.  This is highly unlikely but possible, especially under heavy load.  Without a database-level unique constraint, this could result in duplicate slugs.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Crucially, ensure a unique index is added to the slug column in the database.** This is the *most important* defense against collisions.
            ```ruby
            # In a migration:
            add_index :your_table_name, :slug, unique: true
            ```
        *   This prevents the database from accepting duplicate slugs, even if the application logic fails.

*   **4.2.4. Over-Reliance on Slugs for Authorization:**
    *   **Problem:**  If the application *only* checks the slug to determine access to a resource, a successful collision grants full access.  This is a fundamental security flaw.
    *   **Example:**  A controller action like this is vulnerable:
        ```ruby
        def show
          @user = User.friendly.find(params[:id]) # :id is the slug
          # No further authorization checks!
        end
        ```
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Always implement proper authorization checks *after* retrieving the resource.**  Use a gem like Pundit or CanCanCan.
        *   Example (using Pundit):
            ```ruby
            def show
              @user = User.friendly.find(params[:id])
              authorize @user # Checks if the current user can view this user
            end
            ```
        *   The authorization logic should consider the current user's permissions and relationship to the resource, *not just the slug*.

*   **4.2.5. Lack of Rate Limiting and Monitoring:**
    *   **Problem:**  Without rate limiting, an attacker can make numerous requests to guess slugs rapidly.  Without monitoring, these attempts might go unnoticed.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting (e.g., using the `rack-attack` gem) to restrict the number of requests per IP address or user within a given time period.  Focus on routes that use slugs for resource retrieval.
        *   Configure logging to record failed attempts to access resources via slugs (e.g., 404 errors).
        *   Set up alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as a high volume of 404 errors or repeated requests with similar slugs.

*  **4.2.6. Using Scopes Incorrectly:**
    * **Problem:** If using `friendly_id`'s scoped slugs feature, ensure the scope is correctly implemented and enforced.  A misconfigured scope could allow collisions across different scopes.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * Carefully review the `scoped` configuration in your model.
        * Ensure that your controllers and authorization logic correctly handle the scope.  For example, if slugs are scoped to a `company_id`, make sure you're always retrieving resources within the correct company context.

**4.3. Actionable Recommendations (Prioritized):**

1.  **Database Uniqueness (Highest Priority):**  Immediately add a unique index to the slug column in the database for all models using `friendly_id`. This is non-negotiable.
2.  **Authorization Checks:**  Implement robust authorization logic (Pundit, CanCanCan) that goes beyond simply checking the slug.  Verify user permissions *after* retrieving the resource.
3.  **Strong Slug Generation:**  Use a combination of attributes and random components to generate slugs.  Avoid relying solely on short titles or IDs.  Leverage `friendly_id`'s `candidates` feature.
4.  **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on routes that use slugs to prevent brute-force attacks.
5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Configure logging and alerts to detect and respond to suspicious slug-related activity.
6.  **Review `friendly_id` Configuration:**  Ensure the sequence separator is secure (use the default `--`) and that any custom slug generation logic is robust.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Include slug collision/prediction checks as part of regular security audits and penetration testing.

**4.4. Conclusion:**

The "Slug Collision/Prediction" attack path presents a significant risk if not properly addressed. While `friendly_id` provides helpful tools, it's crucial to configure it correctly and implement robust security measures around it.  By following the recommendations outlined above, we can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack, ensuring the security and integrity of our application. The most critical steps are adding a database unique constraint and implementing proper authorization.
