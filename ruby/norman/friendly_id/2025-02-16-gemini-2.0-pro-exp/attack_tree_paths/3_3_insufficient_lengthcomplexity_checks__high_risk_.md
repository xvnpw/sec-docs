# Deep Analysis: Insufficient Length/Complexity Checks in Friendly_ID

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Insufficient Length/Complexity Checks" attack vector (3.3) within the attack tree.  We aim to understand:

*   How this vulnerability can be exploited in a real-world scenario.
*   The specific code-level weaknesses that contribute to this vulnerability.
*   The practical impact on the application's security and data integrity.
*   Effective mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this vulnerability.
*   How to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `friendly_id` gem (https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) and its usage within a Ruby on Rails application.  We will consider:

*   The default configurations of `friendly_id`.
*   Common developer mistakes that can lead to insufficient length/complexity.
*   Interactions with other application components (e.g., routing, controllers, models).
*   The impact on resources identified by `friendly_id` slugs (e.g., user profiles, articles, products).
*   This analysis *does not* cover general brute-force or dictionary attack mitigation at the network or infrastructure level (e.g., WAF rules, rate limiting at the load balancer).  It focuses on the application-level vulnerability related to `friendly_id`.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the `friendly_id` gem's source code and documentation to understand its slug generation and validation mechanisms.
2.  **Scenario Analysis:** We will construct realistic scenarios where insufficient length/complexity checks could be exploited.
3.  **Vulnerability Testing:** We will simulate attack attempts to demonstrate the vulnerability's exploitability (in a controlled testing environment, *not* production).
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques.
5.  **Detection Strategy:** We will outline methods for detecting exploitation attempts.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.3: Insufficient Length/Complexity Checks

### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

The core issue is that if a developer overrides `friendly_id`'s default behavior or fails to implement additional validation, short and/or predictable slugs can be generated.  This significantly reduces the search space for an attacker attempting to guess valid slugs.  This vulnerability directly facilitates the success of higher-level attack vectors like:

*   **1.1 Brute-Force Attacks:**  Trying all possible combinations of characters within a limited length.
*   **1.2 Dictionary Attacks:**  Using a list of common words or phrases as potential slugs.

### 4.2. Code-Level Weaknesses

Several code-level issues can contribute to this vulnerability:

1.  **Overriding Default Length:** `friendly_id` uses UUIDs by default, which provide good length and randomness.  However, a developer might choose to use a shorter, sequential ID or a custom slug generation method that produces short slugs.  Example (bad practice):

    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :username, use: :slugged

      # BAD:  Allows short usernames, leading to short slugs.
      validates :username, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }

      def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
        username_changed?
      end
    end
    ```

2.  **Insufficient `slug_candidates`:**  If using the `:slugged` module and a custom slug generation method, the `slug_candidates` method might return a limited set of predictable options.  Example (bad practice):

    ```ruby
    class Article < ApplicationRecord
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged

      def slug_candidates
        [
          title.parameterize,  # Might be short if the title is short.
          "article-#{id}"     # Predictable.
        ]
      end
    end
    ```

3.  **Lack of Uniqueness Validation (Beyond `friendly_id`):** While `friendly_id` handles uniqueness within its scope, a developer might introduce custom logic that weakens this.  For example, allowing a user to *choose* their own slug without sufficient length/complexity checks.

4.  **No Rate Limiting on Slug Generation/Update:**  Even if slugs are reasonably long, an attacker might try to create many resources with slightly different slugs to probe for valid ones.  Lack of rate limiting on actions that generate or update slugs exacerbates this.

### 4.3. Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: User Profile Enumeration**

*   **Application:** A social media platform uses `friendly_id` for user profiles (e.g., `example.com/users/john-doe`).
*   **Vulnerability:** The developer allows usernames as short as 3 characters and uses the username directly as the slug.
*   **Attack:** An attacker uses a script to try common usernames (e.g., "bob", "alice", "admin") and short combinations ("aaa", "aab", "aac").  They can quickly discover existing user profiles.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can enumerate user accounts, potentially identifying targets for further attacks (e.g., phishing, password guessing).

**Scenario 2:  Hidden Content Discovery**

*   **Application:** A blog uses `friendly_id` for articles, including draft or unpublished articles.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The developer uses a sequential ID as the basis for the slug (e.g., "article-1", "article-2").
*   **Attack:** An attacker tries sequential slugs to discover unpublished or draft content.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker gains access to confidential information or content intended for later release.

**Scenario 3:  SEO Manipulation**

*   **Application:** An e-commerce site uses `friendly_id` for product pages.
*   **Vulnerability:** The developer allows very short product names, resulting in short slugs.
*   **Attack:** A competitor creates many products with short, common keywords as slugs, hoping to "squat" on valuable URLs and disrupt the site's search engine optimization (SEO).
*   **Impact:**  The competitor gains an unfair advantage in search engine rankings.

### 4.4. Vulnerability Testing (Simulated)

We can simulate these attacks using simple scripts.  For example, in Ruby:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

# Scenario 1: User Profile Enumeration
base_url = "https://example.com/users/"
usernames = ["bob", "alice", "admin", "aaa", "aab", "aac"]

usernames.each do |username|
  uri = URI(base_url + username)
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)

  if response.code == "200"
    puts "Found user: #{username}"
  elsif response.code == "404"
    # Not found (expected)
  else
    puts "Unexpected response for #{username}: #{response.code}"
  end
end

# Scenario 2: Hidden Content Discovery (simplified)
base_url = "https://example.com/articles/article-"
(1..100).each do |id|
  uri = URI(base_url + id.to_s)
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
  # ... (same response handling as above) ...
end
```

These scripts demonstrate how easily an attacker can probe for valid slugs if the length/complexity is insufficient.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Enforce Minimum Slug Length:**  Use Rails validations to ensure a minimum length for the *source* of the slug (e.g., username, title).  This is the most crucial step.

    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      # ...
      validates :username, presence: true, length: { minimum: 8 } # Enforce minimum length
      # ...
    end
    ```

2.  **Use UUIDs (Default):**  Stick with `friendly_id`'s default UUID-based slugs unless you have a very strong reason to change it.  UUIDs provide excellent randomness and length.

3.  **Use `slug_candidates` Wisely:** If you *must* use custom slugs, provide a robust `slug_candidates` method that generates multiple, unpredictable options.  Consider incorporating a random component.

    ```ruby
    def slug_candidates
      [
        title.parameterize,
        "#{title.parameterize}-#{SecureRandom.hex(4)}", # Add randomness
        "#{title.parameterize}-#{SecureRandom.uuid}"   # Even better
      ]
    end
    ```

4.  **Add Custom Validation:**  Implement custom validation logic to reject slugs that are too simple (e.g., contain only lowercase letters, are on a dictionary list).

    ```ruby
    validate :slug_complexity

    def slug_complexity
      if slug.present? && slug.length < 8
        errors.add(:slug, "is too short")
      end
      # Add more checks (e.g., presence of numbers, special characters)
    end
    ```

5.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on actions that create or update resources with slugs.  This makes brute-force and dictionary attacks much more difficult.  Use gems like `rack-attack` for this.

6.  **Consider `history` Module:**  The `friendly_id` `history` module can help prevent slug reuse, even if a previous record is deleted.  This makes it harder for attackers to "squat" on previously used slugs.

7. **Consider `scoped` Module:** If slugs only need to be unique within a certain scope (e.g., articles within a category), use the `scoped` module. This reduces the overall attack surface.

### 4.6. Detection Strategies

1.  **Monitor for 404 Errors:**  A sudden spike in 404 errors, especially for URLs that follow a predictable pattern (e.g., sequential IDs, short strings), could indicate a brute-force or dictionary attack.

2.  **Log Slug Generation/Update Attempts:**  Log all attempts to create or update resources with slugs, including the source data (e.g., username, title) and the generated slug.  This provides an audit trail for investigation.

3.  **Analyze Logs for Patterns:**  Use log analysis tools to identify patterns in slug generation attempts.  Look for:
    *   High frequency of requests from the same IP address.
    *   Requests with sequentially incrementing values.
    *   Requests using common words or phrases.

4.  **Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Use an IDS to detect and block malicious traffic, including brute-force and dictionary attacks.

5.  **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities, including insufficient length/complexity checks.

## 5. Conclusion

Insufficient length/complexity checks for `friendly_id` slugs represent a significant security risk.  By overriding defaults or failing to implement proper validation, developers can inadvertently create an easy target for attackers.  However, by following the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of these attacks.  Combining strong validation, rate limiting, and robust detection mechanisms provides a layered defense against slug-based vulnerabilities.  Regular security audits and code reviews are essential to ensure that these defenses remain effective.
