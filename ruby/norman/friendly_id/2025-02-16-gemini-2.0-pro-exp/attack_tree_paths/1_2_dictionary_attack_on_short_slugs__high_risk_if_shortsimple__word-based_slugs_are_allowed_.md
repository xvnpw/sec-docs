# Deep Analysis: Dictionary Attack on FriendlyId Short Slugs

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the vulnerability of a Ruby on Rails application using the `friendly_id` gem to dictionary attacks targeting short, predictable slugs.  We will assess the practical exploitability, potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview provided in the initial attack tree.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to harden the application against this specific threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:**  Ruby on Rails applications utilizing the `friendly_id` gem (https://github.com/norman/friendly_id).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Dictionary attacks specifically targeting the slug generation and resolution mechanism of `friendly_id`.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors against the application (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) or other potential vulnerabilities within `friendly_id` itself (e.g., slug collision attacks, which are a separate branch of the attack tree).  We are solely focused on dictionary attacks against short/predictable slugs.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (FriendlyId & Application):**  Examine the `friendly_id` source code and the application's implementation to understand how slugs are generated, stored, and used in routing.  This includes identifying:
    *   Configuration options related to slug length, complexity, and uniqueness.
    *   How the application uses `friendly_id` (e.g., which models use it, how slugs are generated).
    *   Existing validation or sanitization logic applied to slugs.
2.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Determine the conditions under which a dictionary attack is most likely to succeed.  This involves:
    *   Analyzing the application's data model to identify resources that might use short, predictable slugs (e.g., user profiles, blog post categories, product names).
    *   Evaluating the effectiveness of default `friendly_id` settings against dictionary attacks.
    *   Identifying any custom slug generation logic that might introduce weaknesses.
3.  **Exploitability Analysis:**  Simulate a dictionary attack using readily available tools and techniques. This will involve:
    *   Creating a realistic wordlist based on the application's context (e.g., if it's a blog about cooking, the wordlist would include cooking-related terms).
    *   Developing a simple script (e.g., in Python or Ruby) to automate the attack.
    *   Measuring the success rate and speed of the attack under different configurations.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage an attacker could inflict by successfully guessing slugs. This includes:
    *   Identifying sensitive data or functionality that could be accessed via compromised slugs.
    *   Evaluating the potential for data leakage, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the vulnerability.  This will include:
    *   Specific configuration changes to `friendly_id`.
    *   Code modifications to the application (e.g., adding validation, rate limiting).
    *   Security best practices for slug generation and handling.
6.  **Detection Strategies:** Outline methods for detecting and responding to dictionary attacks in progress.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Dictionary Attack on Short Slugs

### 4.1 Code Review

**FriendlyId:**

*   **Slug Candidates:** `friendly_id` allows defining "slug candidates," which are alternative values used to generate a unique slug if the primary candidate is already taken.  This is a crucial feature for preventing collisions, but it also impacts dictionary attack resistance.
*   **Sequence Separator:**  By default, `friendly_id` appends a sequence number (e.g., `-2`, `-3`) to a slug if a collision occurs.  This is important for uniqueness but can make slugs slightly more predictable.
*   **`:slugged` option:** This is the most basic configuration, simply slugging a single attribute.  It's the most vulnerable to dictionary attacks if the underlying attribute is predictable.
*   **`:scoped` option:**  This option makes slugs unique within the scope of another model (e.g., a blog post slug is unique within its category).  This can *reduce* the attack surface if the scoping model has a limited number of instances, but it doesn't eliminate the vulnerability.
*   **`:history` option:**  This option keeps track of previous slugs, preventing them from being reused.  This is primarily for SEO and redirect purposes and doesn't directly impact dictionary attack resistance.
*   **`:finders` option:**  This option controls whether `friendly_id` overrides the default `find` method.  It's relevant to how the application interacts with slugs.
*   **`reserve_words`:** This option allows to define list of words that cannot be used as slugs.

**Application (Hypothetical Example - Blog):**

Let's assume a blog application uses `friendly_id` on the `Category` model, and the slug is generated from the `name` attribute:

```ruby
# app/models/category.rb
class Category < ApplicationRecord
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
end
```

And the application uses these categories in routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :categories, only: [:show]
```

This is a *highly vulnerable* configuration.  If the category names are common words (e.g., "News," "Reviews," "Tutorials"), a dictionary attack is almost guaranteed to succeed.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Assessment

*   **High Risk Scenario:**  The example above represents a high-risk scenario.  Short, common category names are directly translated into slugs.  An attacker can easily create a wordlist of common blog category names and attempt to access `/categories/news`, `/categories/reviews`, etc.
*   **Default Settings:**  The default `friendly_id` settings offer *minimal* protection against dictionary attacks.  The sequence separator (`--2`, `--3`) only helps with collisions, not predictability.
*   **Custom Logic:**  If the application uses custom slug generation logic (e.g., truncating names, removing certain characters), it could *increase* or *decrease* vulnerability.  For example, truncating long names to a fixed length could make them more predictable.
*   **Data Model:**  Models with attributes that are likely to be short, common words (e.g., `name`, `title`, `category`) are the most vulnerable.

### 4.3 Exploitability Analysis

**Wordlist Creation:**

A simple wordlist for the blog example could be:

```
news
reviews
tutorials
guides
tips
recipes
interviews
events
products
services
about
contact
blog
articles
posts
```

**Attack Script (Example - Python):**

```python
import requests

base_url = "https://your-blog-app.com/categories/"
wordlist = ["news", "reviews", "tutorials", ...]  # Load from file

for word in wordlist:
    url = base_url + word
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Found valid slug: {word}")
    elif response.status_code == 404:
        print(f"Slug not found: {word}")
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected status code ({response.status_code}) for: {word}")
```

This script iterates through the wordlist, making requests to the `/categories/` endpoint with each word as the slug.  A `200 OK` response indicates a successful guess.

**Success Rate:**  In the high-risk scenario, the success rate would be very high, likely approaching 100% for common category names.

**Speed:**  The attack speed depends on network latency and the application's response time.  Without rate limiting, an attacker could test hundreds or thousands of slugs per second.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

*   **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker could gain access to category pages, potentially revealing information about the blog's content, structure, or even unpublished content if the application doesn't properly handle authorization.
*   **Data Leakage:**  If category pages contain sensitive information (e.g., internal notes, draft content), this information could be leaked.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not the primary goal of a dictionary attack, a high volume of requests could potentially overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service.  This is more likely if the application doesn't have proper rate limiting.
*   **SEO Manipulation:**  In some cases, an attacker might be able to manipulate search engine rankings by discovering and exploiting hidden or unpublished content.

### 4.5 Mitigation Recommendations

1.  **Increase Slug Length and Complexity:**
    *   **Don't rely solely on short, single-word attributes.**  Combine multiple attributes or add random characters.
    *   **Example (Category Model):**
        ```ruby
        friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged

        def slug_candidates
          [
            :name,
            [:name, SecureRandom.hex(4)], # Add 4 random hex characters
            [:name, SecureRandom.hex(8)]  # Add 8 random hex characters
          ]
        end
        ```
        This uses `SecureRandom.hex` to generate random hexadecimal strings, significantly increasing the entropy of the slug.  The `slug_candidates` method provides fallback options if the initial `name` is already taken.

2.  **Use UUIDs as an Alternative:**
    *   Consider using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of slugs for resources that don't require human-readable URLs.  UUIDs are virtually guaranteed to be unique and are not susceptible to dictionary attacks.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        friendly_id :generate_uuid, use: :uuid

        def generate_uuid
          SecureRandom.uuid
        end
        ```

3.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**
    *   Use a gem like `rack-attack` to limit the number of requests to routes using `friendly_id` from a single IP address within a given time period.  This is crucial for preventing brute-force and dictionary attacks.
    *   **Example (config/initializers/rack_attack.rb):**
        ```ruby
        Rack::Attack.throttle("requests by ip", limit: 5, period: 1.minute) do |req|
          req.ip if req.path.start_with?('/categories/') # Throttle requests to /categories/
        end
        ```

4.  **Add Validation:**
    *   Implement custom validation logic to ensure that slugs meet certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, character restrictions).
    *   **Example (Category Model):**
        ```ruby
        validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5 } # Enforce minimum name length
        validate :slug_complexity

        def slug_complexity
          return unless slug.present?
          unless slug.match?(/[a-z0-9\-]+/) # Example: Only allow lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
            errors.add(:slug, "must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens")
          end
        end
        ```

5.  **Use `reserve_words`:**
    *   Use `reserve_words` option to define list of words that cannot be used as slugs.
    *   **Example (Category Model):**
        ```ruby
          friendly_id :name, use: [:slugged, :reserved]
          
          def reserved_words
            %w(admin administrator root)
          end
        ```

6.  **Avoid Direct Mapping:**
    *   Don't directly map user-provided input to slugs without sanitization or transformation.  This is especially important if users can create their own resources with slugs.

7.  **Regularly Review and Update:**
    *   Periodically review the application's slug generation logic and update it as needed to address new threats or vulnerabilities.

### 4.6 Detection Strategies

1.  **Monitor 404 Errors:**  A sudden spike in `404 Not Found` errors, particularly for requests to routes using `friendly_id`, could indicate a dictionary attack.
2.  **Log Failed Slug Lookups:**  Log attempts to access resources with invalid slugs.  This can provide valuable data for identifying attack patterns.
3.  **Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Configure an IDS to detect and alert on suspicious network activity, such as a high volume of requests to similar URLs.
4.  **Implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Use a SIEM system to collect and analyze security logs from various sources, including web servers and application logs.  This can help identify and correlate events related to dictionary attacks.
5.  **Rate Limiting Alerts:**  Configure alerts for when rate limiting is triggered.  This can indicate an ongoing attack.

## 5. Conclusion

Dictionary attacks against `friendly_id` slugs are a serious threat, especially when the application uses short, predictable slugs.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.  A combination of increasing slug complexity, rate limiting, validation, and robust detection mechanisms is essential for protecting applications that use `friendly_id`.  Regular security reviews and updates are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
