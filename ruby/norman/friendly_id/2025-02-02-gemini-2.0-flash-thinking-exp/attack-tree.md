## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Slug Retrieval/Lookup Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_slug_retrievallookup_weaknesses.md)

*   **Threat:** This node represents a critical area because vulnerabilities in how slugs are used for data retrieval can lead to severe security breaches. If slug lookups are not handled securely, attackers can manipulate them to gain unauthorized access or extract/modify data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Slug Injection Vulnerability (SQL Injection or similar)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_slug_injection_vulnerability__sql_injection_or_similar_.md)

*   **Threat:** This is a highly critical node. If the application is vulnerable to slug injection (primarily SQL Injection), attackers can execute arbitrary database commands.
*   **High-Risk Path: 2.1.1 Manipulate Slug Parameter in URL/Query**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., SQL) into the slug parameter in URLs or API requests.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 2.1.1.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks**
            *   **Threat:** By manipulating the slug parameter, attackers can bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, gaining access to restricted areas or functionalities without proper credentials.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**  Strictly use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions involving slug parameters. Implement robust authentication and authorization logic that is not solely dependent on slug validity.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 2.1.1.2 Extract Sensitive Data from Database**
            *   **Threat:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data directly from the database, leading to data breaches and confidentiality loss.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**  Parameterize all database queries. Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 2.1.1.3 Modify or Delete Data in Database**
            *   **Threat:** Attackers can use SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity loss, service disruption, and potential financial or reputational damage.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**  Enforce principle of least privilege for database access. Implement robust input validation and output encoding, although parameterized queries are the primary defense.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via Slug](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__via_slug.md)

*   **Threat:** If authorization is insufficient and relies on the mere presence of a valid slug, attackers can exploit IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **High-Risk Path: 2.2.1 Access Resources Belonging to Other Users via Slug Manipulation**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to access resources by manipulating slugs, potentially guessing or finding slugs belonging to other users.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 2.2.1.1 View Private User Data**
            *   **Threat:** Attackers can view private data of other users by accessing resources using their slugs, leading to privacy breaches and confidentiality loss.
            *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement strong authorization checks that verify if the *current user* has permission to access the *specific resource* identified by the slug. Do not rely on slug obscurity for security.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 2.2.1.2 Modify Resources of Other Users**
            *   **Threat:** Attackers can modify resources belonging to other users if actions are tied to slug lookups and authorization is weak, leading to data integrity loss and unauthorized actions.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**  Enforce authorization checks before allowing any modification actions based on slug lookups. Ensure that users can only modify resources they own or are explicitly authorized to manage.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Insecure Slug Generation Logic (Custom Implementations)](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_insecure_slug_generation_logic__custom_implementations_.md)

*   **Threat:** If developers implement custom slug generation logic that is weak or predictable, it reintroduces vulnerabilities related to predictable slugs.
*   **Critical Node: 4.1 Insecure Slug Generation Logic (Custom Implementations)**
    *   **High-Risk Path: 1.1.1.1 Access Sensitive Resources via Guessable Slugs** (Linked from original tree)
        *   **Threat:** If custom slug generators produce predictable slugs, attackers can guess valid slugs and access sensitive resources without proper authorization (if authorization relies on obscurity or is weak).
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid implementing custom slug generators unless absolutely necessary. If custom generators are required, use strong, cryptographically secure random string generation methods. Review custom code for predictability and security weaknesses. Prefer using `friendly_id`'s built-in options.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Denial of Service (DoS) related to Slug Operations](./attack_tree_paths/5__denial_of_service__dos__related_to_slug_operations.md)

*   **Threat:**  Slug operations, especially lookups, can be targeted for Denial of Service attacks if not properly protected.
*   **High-Risk Path: 5.2 Database Load via Slug Lookups**
    *   **High-Risk Path: 5.2.1 Send High Volume of Requests with Varying Slugs**
        *   **High-Risk Path: 5.2.1.1 Degrade Application Performance or Cause Outage**
            *   **Threat:** Attackers can send a high volume of requests with varying slugs to overload the database with lookup queries, leading to degraded application performance or complete service outages.
            *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement rate limiting on slug-based endpoints to prevent abuse. Utilize caching mechanisms to reduce database load for frequently accessed resources. Optimize database queries and indexing for efficient slug lookups. Monitor server and database performance for anomalies.
