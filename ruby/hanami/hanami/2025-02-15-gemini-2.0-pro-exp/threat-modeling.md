# Threat Model Analysis for hanami/hanami

## Threat: [Component Boundary Bypass](./threats/component_boundary_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Component Boundary Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a weakness in the *enforcement* of separation between Hanami slices or actions. This is a flaw *within Hanami's core architecture* that allows one component to unexpectedly influence another, bypassing intended access controls or data validation, *even if the developer followed best practices*. This is *not* about a developer making a mistake, but about a flaw in Hanami's isolation mechanisms. This could involve a bug in how Hanami manages shared state, a vulnerability in its inter-component communication, or a flaw in how it enforces interface contracts.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to data or functionality within other components, privilege escalation within the application, potential denial of service by disrupting component interactions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hanami Slices, Actions, inter-component communication mechanisms (e.g., events, if used), potentially shared repositories or entities. *Specifically, the Hanami framework code responsible for enforcing isolation.*
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Framework Updates:**  Keep Hanami updated to the latest version.  This is the *primary* mitigation, as it addresses potential flaws in the framework itself.
        *   **Security Advisories:**  Monitor for security advisories specifically related to Hanami's component isolation mechanisms.
        *   **Deep Code Review (of Hanami):**  If feasible (for open-source contributors or security researchers), conduct deep code reviews of Hanami's core code related to component isolation.
        *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If a vulnerability is found, responsibly disclose it to the Hanami maintainers.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Hanami Core Dependencies)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__hanami_core_dependencies_.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Hanami Core Dependencies)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Hanami's *core* dependencies â€“ those that are *essential* to Hanami's functionality and are directly managed by the Hanami project (e.g., a vulnerability in a `dry-rb` gem that Hanami *requires* and that is tightly coupled to Hanami's internal workings). This is distinct from vulnerabilities in *application-level* dependencies. The attacker crafts input or triggers a specific code path that leverages the *core* dependency's vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Variable, depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.  The impact is likely to be severe because it affects a core component of the framework.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Hanami component that utilizes the vulnerable *core* dependency. This could be core Hanami modules, routing components, or other fundamental parts of the framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the dependency and the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Framework Updates:** Keep Hanami updated to the latest version. Hanami releases will include updates to its core dependencies.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor for security advisories specifically related to Hanami *and its core dependencies*.
        *   **Dependency Scanning (Focused):** While general dependency scanning is important, prioritize scanning and updates for Hanami's *core* dependencies.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure via Configuration (Hanami's Loading Mechanism)](./threats/secrets_exposure_via_configuration__hanami's_loading_mechanism_.md)

*   **Threat:** Secrets Exposure via Configuration (Hanami's Loading Mechanism)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive configuration data due to a vulnerability *within Hanami's configuration loading mechanism itself*. This is *not* about a developer accidentally committing secrets, but about a flaw in how Hanami *reads, parses, or stores* configuration data. For example, a bug in Hanami's `.env` file parsing logic that could lead to unintended exposure.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, or other resources. Potentially complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hanami's configuration system (specifically, the code responsible for loading and processing configuration data from `.env` files, environment variables, or other sources).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Framework Updates:** Keep Hanami updated to the latest version to address any vulnerabilities in its configuration loading mechanism.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor for security advisories specifically related to Hanami's configuration system.
        *   **Code Review (of Hanami):** If feasible, conduct code reviews of Hanami's configuration loading code.
