Okay, let's create a design document for the Hanami web framework, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Hanami is a Ruby web framework.  It aims to provide a simpler, more maintainable, and secure alternative to larger, more monolithic frameworks like Ruby on Rails.  The business priorities and goals can be inferred as follows:

*   _Developer Productivity:_ Enable rapid development of web applications.  This is a core value proposition of web frameworks.
*   _Maintainability:_  Promote a clean, modular architecture that is easier to understand, test, and maintain over time. This reduces long-term costs and improves agility.
*   _Security:_  Provide built-in security features and encourage secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities. This protects users and the reputation of applications built with Hanami.
*   _Performance:_ Offer good performance to ensure a responsive user experience.
*   _Community Growth:_ Attract and retain a community of developers to contribute to the framework and support its ecosystem.
*   _Adoption:_ Increase adoption of the framework by businesses and individual developers.

_Most Important Business Risks:_

*   _Security Vulnerabilities:_  Vulnerabilities in the framework itself could be exploited in applications built using Hanami, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage. This is the most critical risk.
*   _Lack of Adoption:_ If the framework fails to gain sufficient traction, it may become unsustainable, leaving users without support and updates.
*   _Competition:_  The framework competes with established frameworks like Rails.  Failure to keep up with features and security best practices could lead to a loss of users.
*   _Maintainability Issues:_ If the framework's codebase becomes difficult to maintain, it could slow down development, introduce bugs, and hinder security updates.
*   _Performance Bottlenecks:_  Poor performance could lead to a negative user experience and drive users to alternative frameworks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Hanami, by design, incorporates several security-conscious features.  However, the security posture of any *application* built with Hanami depends heavily on how the developer utilizes the framework and implements additional security controls.

*   _security control:_ Secure by default configurations. Hanami emphasizes secure defaults to reduce the likelihood of common vulnerabilities. (Described in Hanami documentation and guides).
*   _security control:_ Modular design. The architecture promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to isolate and secure different parts of an application. (Described in Hanami architecture documentation).
*   _security control:_ Built-in CSRF protection. Hanami provides mechanisms to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. (Described in Hanami security guides).
*   _security control:_ Built-in XSS protection. It provides escaping mechanisms to prevent Cross-Site Scripting. (Described in Hanami security guides).
*   _security control:_ Encourages use of secure coding practices. The framework's design and documentation guide developers towards secure development patterns. (Described in Hanami guides and best practices).
*   _accepted risk:_  Reliance on third-party gems. Like all Ruby frameworks, Hanami applications rely on external gems, which may introduce vulnerabilities.  This is a common risk in the Ruby ecosystem.
*   _accepted risk:_  Developer error.  Even with secure defaults, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities through insecure coding practices or misconfiguration.
*   _accepted risk:_  Zero-day vulnerabilities.  The framework itself, or its dependencies, may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.

_Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):_

*   _security control:_ Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP). This is not explicitly built-in but highly recommended for any web application.
*   _security control:_ Regularly update dependencies.  This includes Hanami itself and all associated gems.  Automated dependency management and vulnerability scanning are crucial.
*   _security control:_ Implement robust logging and monitoring.  This is essential for detecting and responding to security incidents.
*   _security control:_ Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. This helps identify vulnerabilities that may be missed during development.
*   _security control:_ Implement input validation and sanitization beyond what's provided by default, tailored to the specific application's needs.

_Security Requirements:_

*   _Authentication:_
    *   Hanami does not provide built-in authentication. Developers must implement their own or use a third-party authentication gem (e.g., Devise, Rodauth).
    *   The chosen authentication mechanism MUST support strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   The authentication system MUST implement secure session management, including protection against session fixation and hijacking.
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) SHOULD be considered for sensitive applications.

*   _Authorization:_
    *   Hanami provides basic mechanisms for authorization (e.g., defining access control rules).
    *   The authorization system MUST enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) SHOULD be implemented as needed.

*   _Input Validation:_
    *   Hanami provides some input validation helpers.
    *   ALL user-supplied input MUST be validated on the server-side, using a whitelist approach whenever possible.
    *   Input validation rules MUST be tailored to the expected data type and format.
    *   Input validation MUST be performed before any data processing or storage.

*   _Cryptography:_
    *   Hanami does not provide extensive cryptographic functionality directly. Developers are expected to use appropriate Ruby libraries.
    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) MUST be stored securely using strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Cryptographic keys MUST be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
    *   HTTPS MUST be used for all communication, and HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) SHOULD be enabled.

2.  _Containerized Deployment (Docker):_ Packaging the application and its dependencies into a Docker container and deploying it to a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
3.  _Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):_ Deploying to a PaaS provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk) that handles the underlying infrastructure.
4.  _Serverless Deployment:_ Deploying individual functions to a serverless platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions). This is less common for full Hanami applications but could be used for specific parts.

We'll describe a *Containerized Deployment* using Docker and Kubernetes:

## BUILD

The build process for a Hanami application typically involves the following steps:

1.  _Developer writes code:_ Developers write code and commit it to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2.  _CI/CD pipeline triggered:_ A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI) is triggered by a commit or other event.
3.  _Dependencies installed:_ The pipeline installs the required dependencies (Ruby gems) using Bundler.
4.  _Tests run:_ Automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) are executed.
5.  _Code analysis:_ Static analysis tools (e.g., RuboCop, Brakeman) are run to check for code quality and security vulnerabilities.
6.  _Container built (if applicable):_ If using containerization, a Docker image is built, incorporating the application code and dependencies.
7.  _Artifacts published:_ The build artifacts (e.g., Docker image, packaged application) are published to a repository (e.g., Docker Hub, a private container registry).

```

_Security Controls in the Build Process:_

*   _security control:_ Secure build environment: The CI/CD pipeline should run in a secure environment, isolated from other systems.
*   _security control:_ Dependency management: Bundler helps manage dependencies and ensure consistent versions.
*   _security control:_ Vulnerability scanning: Tools like Bundler-audit and Brakeman can scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and the application code.
*   _security control:_ Static analysis: RuboCop enforces coding standards and can detect potential security issues. Brakeman specifically focuses on security vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails applications (and can be adapted for Hanami).
*   _security control:_ Automated security testing: Incorporate security tests into the test suite (e.g., tests for authentication, authorization, input validation).
*   _security control:_ Container security scanning (if applicable): If using Docker, scan the container image for vulnerabilities before publishing it.
*   _security control:_ Least privilege: The build process should run with the minimum necessary privileges.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   _Critical Business Processes:_
    *   User authentication and authorization.
    *   Data processing and storage.
    *   Interaction with external services (e.g., payment gateways).
    *   Serving web content to users.

*   _Data to Protect and Sensitivity:_
