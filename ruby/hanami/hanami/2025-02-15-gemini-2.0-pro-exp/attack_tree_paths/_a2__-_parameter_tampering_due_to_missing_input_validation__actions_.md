Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on parameter tampering in Hanami applications:

# Deep Analysis: Parameter Tampering in Hanami Actions (A2)

## 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability described in attack tree path A2 ("Parameter Tampering due to Missing Input Validation (Actions)") within the context of a Hanami web application.  This includes:

*   Identifying the root causes of the vulnerability.
*   Analyzing the potential impact on the application's security and data integrity.
*   Developing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.
*   Providing developers with clear examples and best practices to avoid this vulnerability.
*   Assessing the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on parameter tampering vulnerabilities that occur within Hanami *Actions*.  It covers:

*   **Input Sources:**  All sources of input parameters to Actions, including:
    *   HTTP request parameters (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
    *   Route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`).
    *   Request headers (though less common for direct manipulation, still a potential source).
    *   Request body (JSON, XML, form data).
*   **Hanami Versions:**  The analysis considers best practices applicable to recent Hanami versions (2.x and later), but also acknowledges potential differences in older versions.
*   **Validation Mechanisms:**  The analysis examines the use (and misuse) of Hanami's built-in validation features, particularly `dry-validation`, and other relevant libraries.
*   **Data Handling:**  The analysis considers how unvalidated parameters might be used within the Action and subsequently passed to other application components (e.g., repositories, services, views).
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis does *not* cover:
    *   Client-side validation *except* as a defense-in-depth measure.  Client-side validation is easily bypassed and should never be the sole line of defense.
    *   Vulnerabilities outside of Hanami Actions (e.g., direct database access, server configuration issues).
    *   Other attack vectors *except* as they relate to parameter tampering (e.g., XSS, CSRF are separate attack vectors, but parameter tampering could be *used* to facilitate them).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the vulnerability and its characteristics.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the underlying reasons why this vulnerability occurs in Hanami applications.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of exploiting this vulnerability.
4.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Provide concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Detail specific, actionable steps to prevent and mitigate the vulnerability.
6.  **Code Examples:**  Illustrate both vulnerable and secure code examples using Hanami.
7.  **Testing and Verification:**  Describe how to test for the presence of this vulnerability and verify the effectiveness of mitigations.
8.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate any remaining risks after mitigation.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path A2

### 4.1. Vulnerability Definition

Parameter tampering due to missing input validation in Hanami Actions occurs when an attacker can manipulate the data sent to a Hanami Action, and the Action does not adequately validate this data before using it.  This lack of validation allows the attacker to potentially:

*   **Bypass Security Checks:**  Alter parameters used for authorization or access control.
*   **Corrupt Data:**  Insert malicious or unexpected data that damages the integrity of the application's data.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:**  In some cases, unvalidated parameters might be used in ways that lead to code injection (though this is less common with proper framework usage).
*   **Cause Denial of Service:**  Submit excessively large or malformed data to overwhelm the application.
*   **Manipulate Business Logic:**  Change parameters that control the application's workflow or behavior.

### 4.2. Root Cause Analysis

The root causes of this vulnerability typically stem from:

*   **Missing Validation:**  The Action completely lacks any input validation logic.  Developers might assume that data is safe or rely solely on client-side validation.
*   **Incomplete Validation:**  The Action implements *some* validation, but it's insufficient.  Common mistakes include:
    *   Validating only some parameters, leaving others unchecked.
    *   Using weak validation rules (e.g., only checking for the presence of a parameter, not its type or content).
    *   Relying on blacklists instead of whitelists (allowing all input except for a few known-bad values).
    *   Failing to validate data types (e.g., accepting a string where an integer is expected).
    *   Not checking for length constraints.
    *   Not validating against expected formats (e.g., email addresses, dates).
*   **Incorrect Validation Implementation:**  The Action attempts to use validation, but the implementation is flawed.  This could involve:
    *   Misusing `dry-validation` or other validation libraries.
    *   Creating custom validation logic that contains errors.
    *   Placing validation logic in the wrong part of the application (e.g., in the view instead of the Action).
*   **Over-Reliance on Framework Defaults:**  Assuming that the framework automatically handles all validation without explicitly defining rules.
*   **Lack of Developer Awareness:**  Developers may not be fully aware of the importance of input validation or the best practices for implementing it in Hanami.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of parameter tampering can range from medium to high, depending on the specific parameter and how it's used:

*   **Medium Impact:**
    *   Minor data corruption (e.g., changing a user's display name to something inappropriate).
    *   Limited information disclosure (e.g., revealing internal IDs).
    *   Minor disruption of service (e.g., causing an error message).
*   **High Impact:**
    *   Significant data corruption or loss (e.g., deleting or modifying critical data).
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., viewing other users' private information).
    *   Account takeover (e.g., changing a user's password).
    *   Complete system compromise (in rare cases, if the unvalidated parameter is used in a way that leads to code execution).
    *   Financial loss (e.g., manipulating prices or quantities in an e-commerce application).

### 4.4. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1:  Bypassing Authorization**

Consider a Hanami Action that updates a user's profile:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Action
class Users::Update < Hanami::Action
  def handle(req, res)
    user = UserRepository.new.find(req.params[:id]) # No validation on :id
    user.update(name: req.params[:name]) # No validation on :name
    res.body = "User updated"
  end
end
```

An attacker could tamper with the `id` parameter to update *another user's* profile:

```
POST /users/update
id=123&name=Malicious+Name  # Attacker changes id to target user 123
```

**Scenario 2:  Data Corruption**

Imagine an Action that creates a new product:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Action
class Products::Create < Hanami::Action
  def handle(req, res)
    ProductRepository.new.create(
      name: req.params[:name],
      price: req.params[:price] # No validation on :price
    )
    res.body = "Product created"
  end
end
```

An attacker could submit a negative price:

```
POST /products/create
name=New+Product&price=-100
```

This could disrupt the application's pricing logic or lead to financial losses.

**Scenario 3:  SQL Injection (Indirectly)**

While Hanami's ORM (ROM) generally protects against direct SQL injection, unvalidated parameters *could* still be used in ways that lead to vulnerabilities.  For example, if a raw SQL query is constructed using an unvalidated parameter:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Action (Highly discouraged - use ROM properly!)
class Products::Search < Hanami::Action
  def handle(req, res)
    # DANGEROUS:  Never construct SQL queries like this!
    query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%#{req.params[:query]}%'"
    # ... execute the query ...
  end
end
```

An attacker could inject SQL code through the `query` parameter.  This is a *very bad* practice and highlights why using the ORM correctly is crucial.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation strategy is to implement **comprehensive input validation** in *every* Hanami Action.  Here's a breakdown of best practices:

1.  **Use `dry-validation`:**  Hanami strongly encourages the use of `dry-validation` for defining validation schemas.  This provides a robust and declarative way to specify validation rules.

2.  **Define Clear Schemas:**  Create a validation schema for each Action that defines the expected parameters, their types, formats, and constraints.

3.  **Whitelist Approach:**  Specify *allowed* values rather than trying to block *disallowed* values.  This is much more secure.

4.  **Validate All Parameters:**  Don't assume any parameter is safe.  Validate *everything* that comes from the client.

5.  **Validate at the Action Level:**  The primary validation should occur within the Hanami Action, *before* the data is used in any other part of the application.

6.  **Defense in Depth:**  Consider adding additional validation layers:
    *   **Client-side Validation:**  Provides immediate feedback to the user, but *never* rely on it for security.
    *   **Repository-Level Validation:**  Can provide an extra layer of protection, ensuring that data is valid before it reaches the database.

7.  **Sanitize After Validation:**  After validating the input, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters that might have slipped through.  This is particularly important for data that will be displayed in HTML (to prevent XSS).

8.  **Handle Validation Errors Gracefully:**  Provide clear and informative error messages to the user when validation fails.  Do *not* reveal sensitive information in error messages.

9.  **Regularly Review and Update Validation Rules:**  As the application evolves, ensure that validation rules are kept up-to-date.

### 4.6. Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code (already shown in Exploitation Scenarios)**

**Secure Code (using `dry-validation`)**

```ruby
# app/actions/users/update.rb
require 'dry-validation'

class Users::Update < Hanami::Action
  params do
    required(:id).filled(:integer, gt?: 0) # Must be a positive integer
    required(:name).filled(:string, max_size?: 255) # Must be a string, max 255 chars
  end

  def handle(req, res)
    if req.params.valid?
      user = UserRepository.new.find(req.params[:id])
      user.update(name: req.params[:name])
      res.body = "User updated"
    else
      res.status = 422 # Unprocessable Entity
      res.body = req.params.errors.to_h.to_json # Return validation errors
    end
  end
end

# app/actions/products/create.rb
class Products::Create < Hanami::Action
  params do
    required(:name).filled(:string, max_size?: 255)
    required(:price).filled(:decimal, gt?: 0) # Must be a positive decimal
  end

  def handle(req, res)
    if req.params.valid?
      ProductRepository.new.create(req.params.to_h)
      res.body = "Product created"
    else
      res.status = 422
      res.body = req.params.errors.to_h.to_json
    end
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `params` block defines a `dry-validation` schema.
*   `required(:parameter_name)` specifies that a parameter is mandatory.
*   `.filled` checks that the parameter is not empty.
*   Type constraints are used (e.g., `:integer`, `:string`, `:decimal`).
*   Additional constraints are applied (e.g., `gt?: 0` for positive numbers, `max_size?: 255` for string length).
*   The `req.params.valid?` method checks if the input passes validation.
*   If validation fails, a 422 status code is returned, along with the validation errors.

### 4.7. Testing and Verification

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your Actions that specifically test different input scenarios, including:
    *   Valid input.
    *   Missing required parameters.
    *   Invalid data types.
    *   Values outside of allowed ranges.
    *   Malformed data.
    *   Excessively long strings.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire flow of the application, including how validation errors are handled and displayed to the user.
*   **Security Scans:**  Use automated security scanning tools to identify potential parameter tampering vulnerabilities.  These tools can often detect missing or weak validation.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Have a security expert manually attempt to exploit parameter tampering vulnerabilities.  This can uncover subtle issues that automated tools might miss.
* **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to send a large number of random or semi-random inputs to the application and observe its behavior. This can help identify unexpected edge cases and vulnerabilities.

### 4.8. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with comprehensive input validation, some residual risks may remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in `dry-validation` or other libraries.  Keep your dependencies up-to-date.
*   **Complex Validation Logic:**  Extremely complex validation rules can be difficult to implement correctly and may contain subtle errors.  Keep validation logic as simple and clear as possible.
*   **Human Error:**  Developers can still make mistakes, even with the best tools and practices.  Code reviews and thorough testing are essential.
* **Logic Errors:** Validation might be correctly implemented, but the business logic itself might have flaws that can be exploited even with valid input.

To mitigate these residual risks:

*   **Stay Informed:**  Keep up-to-date with security best practices and vulnerabilities related to Hanami and its dependencies.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application and its components have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

## 5. Conclusion

Parameter tampering due to missing input validation is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences for Hanami applications. By implementing comprehensive input validation using `dry-validation`, following best practices, and conducting thorough testing, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  A defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple layers of validation and security measures, is crucial for building secure and robust Hanami applications. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to protect against evolving threats.
