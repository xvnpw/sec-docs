Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on SQL Injection vulnerabilities within a Hanami application.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [RP1] - SQL Injection due to Unsafe Query Construction (Repositories)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities arising from unsafe query construction within Hanami application repositories.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific code patterns and practices that could lead to this vulnerability.
*   Assess the effectiveness of Hanami's built-in safeguards (primarily `rom-rb`) and identify scenarios where those safeguards might be bypassed or misused.
*   Provide concrete examples of vulnerable and secure code.
*   Recommend specific, actionable steps to mitigate the risk, beyond the general mitigations already listed in the attack tree.
*   Establish a testing strategy to detect and prevent such vulnerabilities.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the repository layer of a Hanami application, specifically how data interacts with the database through `rom-rb`.  We will consider:

*   Hanami versions 2.x and later (as they represent the current and future direction of the framework).
*   Common database adapters used with `rom-rb` (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
*   Various query construction methods available within `rom-rb` (e.g., `where`, `select`, `join`, `order`, custom SQL fragments).
*   Interaction with user input from various sources (e.g., web forms, API requests, command-line interfaces).
*   The impact of Hanami's application structure (slices, actions, repositories) on vulnerability exposure.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine hypothetical and (if available) real-world Hanami repository code examples to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes reviewing the official Hanami documentation and community resources.
2.  **Static Analysis:** We will conceptually apply static analysis principles to identify potentially dangerous code patterns (e.g., string concatenation with user input in SQL contexts).
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** We will describe how dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., penetration testing with SQL injection payloads) could be used to confirm vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker scenarios and how they might attempt to exploit unsafe query construction.
5.  **Best Practices Review:** We will compare observed code patterns against established secure coding best practices for SQL and `rom-rb`.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will analyze the official `rom-rb` and Hanami documentation to understand the intended secure usage patterns and any caveats.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Understanding the Vulnerability**

SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate a database query by injecting malicious SQL code.  This is typically achieved by exploiting unsanitized user input that is directly incorporated into a SQL query string.  In the context of a Hanami repository, the vulnerability arises when developers bypass or misuse the safe query construction mechanisms provided by `rom-rb`.

**2.2.  `rom-rb`'s Built-in Protection**

`rom-rb`, the persistence layer used by Hanami, is designed to prevent SQL injection by default.  It encourages the use of:

*   **Relation Objects:**  Queries are built using relation objects and methods like `where`, `select`, `order`, etc.  These methods automatically handle parameterization and escaping, preventing direct injection.
*   **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):**  Under the hood, `rom-rb` uses prepared statements (or their equivalent) for most database interactions.  This separates the SQL code from the data, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not executable code.
*   **Type Safety:** `rom-rb` enforces type constraints, which can help prevent certain types of injection attacks.

**2.3.  Potential Vulnerability Scenarios (Bypassing `rom-rb` Safeguards)**

Despite `rom-rb`'s protections, vulnerabilities can still arise in several ways:

*   **Raw SQL Fragments with String Interpolation:**  `rom-rb` allows for the inclusion of raw SQL fragments using the `.sql` method.  If a developer uses string interpolation or concatenation *within* this raw SQL fragment to incorporate user input, they create a direct SQL injection vulnerability.

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_by_unsafe_name(name)
        users.where { sql("name = '#{name}'") }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    In above example, if `name` is controlled by user, attacker can inject SQL.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_by_name(name)
        users.where(name: name).to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    Above is secure, because `rom-rb` will handle parameterization.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE (using .sql with parameters)
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_by_complex_condition(name, age)
        users.where { sql('name = ? AND age > ?', name, age) }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    This is also secure, because parameters are passed separately.

*   **Misusing `select` with Raw SQL:**  Similar to `.sql`, using raw SQL within a `select` clause without proper parameterization can introduce vulnerabilities.

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def get_unsafe_data(column_name)
        users.select { sql("#{column_name}") }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    Attacker can control `column_name` and inject SQL.

*   **Incorrectly Handling `LIKE` Clauses:**  While `rom-rb` handles basic `LIKE` clauses safely, developers might try to construct complex `LIKE` patterns with user input, leading to vulnerabilities.

    ```ruby
    # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE (depending on how 'pattern' is constructed)
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_by_pattern(pattern)
        users.where { name.like(pattern) }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    If `pattern` is directly from user input without proper escaping for `LIKE` wildcards (`%` and `_`), it could lead to unexpected results or even denial-of-service.  It's *not* a direct SQL injection, but it's a related data validation issue.

    ```ruby
    # SECURE (escaping LIKE wildcards)
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_by_pattern(pattern)
        escaped_pattern = pattern.gsub('%', '\\%').gsub('_', '\\_')
        users.where { name.like("%#{escaped_pattern}%") }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```
    This escapes the special characters.

*   **Dynamic Table or Column Names (Rare but High Risk):**  If, for some reason, the application needs to dynamically construct table or column names based on user input, this is *extremely* dangerous and requires very careful handling.  `rom-rb` doesn't directly support this, and it should generally be avoided.  If absolutely necessary, a strict whitelist approach is essential.

    ```ruby
    # EXTREMELY VULNERABLE (DO NOT DO THIS)
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      def find_in_table(table_name)
        # This is a placeholder; rom-rb doesn't directly support this.
        # You'd need to use raw SQL, which is highly discouraged.
        # users.where { sql("SELECT * FROM #{table_name}") }.to_a
      end
    end
    ```

    ```ruby
    # SAFER (using a whitelist) - Still risky, consider alternatives
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository[:users]
      ALLOWED_TABLES = %w[users products orders].freeze

      def find_in_table(table_name)
        raise "Invalid table name" unless ALLOWED_TABLES.include?(table_name)

        # Still requires raw SQL, but the table name is now whitelisted.
        # This is a simplified example; a real implementation would be more complex.
        ROM.env.gateways[:default].run("SELECT * FROM #{table_name}")
      end
    end
    ```
    This is better, but still very risky.  The best approach is to avoid dynamic table names entirely.

*   **Bypassing Validation Layers:** Even if the repository itself uses safe query construction, if the input validation in the action or other layers is flawed, an attacker might still be able to inject malicious data that bypasses `rom-rb`'s protections.  This highlights the importance of defense in depth.

**2.4.  Impact and Likelihood Refinement**

*   **Impact:**  The impact remains Very High, as stated in the original attack tree.  Successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise.
*   **Likelihood:**  While `rom-rb` significantly reduces the likelihood, it's not zero.  The likelihood is best described as **Low to Medium**, depending on the developer's understanding of `rom-rb` and secure coding practices.  The "Low" rating in the original tree is optimistic if developers are not thoroughly trained.

**2.5.  Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Hanami and `rom-rb`)**

In addition to the general mitigations listed in the attack tree, we can add these specific recommendations:

*   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  All code that interacts with the database (especially repositories) should undergo mandatory code reviews, with a specific focus on identifying any use of raw SQL fragments and ensuring proper parameterization.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline that can detect potentially unsafe SQL query construction.  While general-purpose Ruby linters (like RuboCop) can help, tools specifically designed for security analysis (e.g., Brakeman) are more effective.
*   **`rom-rb` Security Audits:**  Periodically review the `rom-rb` configuration and usage to ensure that best practices are being followed and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced.
*   **Training:**  Provide developers with specific training on secure coding practices with `rom-rb` and SQL injection prevention.  This training should include hands-on examples and exercises.
*   **Database User Permissions:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the Hanami application has the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a vulnerability.  Use separate accounts for different operations (e.g., read-only vs. read-write).
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* data reaches the repository layer.  This should be done in the action or a dedicated validation layer.  Use Hanami's built-in validation features or a library like `dry-validation`.  Remember, validation is a *defense-in-depth* measure, not a primary defense against SQL injection.
* **Avoid `.sql` unless absolutely necessary:** Prefer using rom-rb query building methods.
* **Use parameters with `.sql`:** If you must use `.sql`, always use parameterized queries.
* **Whitelist dynamic identifiers:** If you must use dynamic table or column names, use a strict whitelist.
* **Escape LIKE wildcards:** If you use `LIKE` with user input, escape the `%` and `_` characters.

**2.6.  Testing Strategy**

A comprehensive testing strategy should include:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for repository methods that specifically test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This can be done by providing known malicious input and verifying that the generated SQL query is safe (e.g., by inspecting the SQL log or using a mocking library to intercept the query).
*   **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests should verify that the entire data flow (from action to repository to database) is secure.  These tests can use a test database and attempt to inject malicious data.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Regular penetration testing, including automated vulnerability scanning and manual testing by security experts, is crucial to identify any vulnerabilities that might have been missed by other testing methods.  Tools like SQLMap can be used to automate SQL injection testing.
*   **Static Analysis (Automated):** As mentioned above, integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. Conclusion

SQL Injection remains a serious threat, even in frameworks like Hanami that provide built-in protection.  While `rom-rb` significantly reduces the risk, developers must be vigilant and follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.  A combination of careful code review, static analysis, robust testing, and developer training is essential to mitigate this risk effectively.  The key takeaway is to *never* trust user input and to *always* use the safe query construction mechanisms provided by `rom-rb` whenever possible.  When raw SQL is unavoidable, extreme caution and rigorous parameterization are mandatory.
