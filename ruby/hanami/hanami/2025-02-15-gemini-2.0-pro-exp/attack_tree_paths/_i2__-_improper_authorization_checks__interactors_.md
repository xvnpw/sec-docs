# Deep Analysis: Improper Authorization Checks in Hanami Interactors

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify potential vulnerabilities related to improper authorization checks within Hanami interactors, understand the exploitation process, assess the associated risks, and propose concrete mitigation strategies tailored to the Hanami framework.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent unauthorized access to data and functionality.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack vector described as "[I2] - Improper Authorization Checks (Interactors)" in the provided attack tree.  The scope includes:

*   **Hanami Interactors:**  We will examine how interactors are designed and used within the Hanami framework, focusing on their role in handling user requests and business logic.
*   **Authorization Mechanisms:** We will analyze common authorization patterns and potential weaknesses within the context of Hanami interactors.  This includes role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and custom authorization logic.
*   **Hanami Application Context:**  We will consider how Hanami's architecture (e.g., actions, repositories, entities) interacts with interactors and how this interaction can impact authorization.
*   **Code Examples:** We will provide illustrative code examples (both vulnerable and secure) to demonstrate the concepts discussed.
*   **Testing Strategies:** We will outline specific testing approaches to identify and verify authorization vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors in the broader attack tree, focusing solely on the interactor-specific authorization issue.  It also assumes a basic understanding of the Hanami framework.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Conceptual Overview:**  Explain the role of interactors in Hanami and how they relate to authorization.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Detail common ways authorization checks can be flawed or bypassed within Hanami interactors.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Provide concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Code Examples (Vulnerable & Secure):**  Show code snippets illustrating both vulnerable and secure implementations of authorization within Hanami interactors.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Offer specific, actionable recommendations for preventing and mitigating these vulnerabilities, leveraging Hanami best practices and security principles.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Describe testing techniques to identify and validate authorization checks, including unit, integration, and potentially penetration testing.
7.  **Tooling and Resources:**  Suggest relevant tools and resources that can aid in implementing and maintaining secure authorization.

## 2. Deep Analysis of [I2] - Improper Authorization Checks (Interactors)

### 2.1 Conceptual Overview: Interactors and Authorization in Hanami

In Hanami, interactors (also known as "operations" or "use cases") are a crucial part of the application's architecture.  They encapsulate a single, well-defined business operation.  Interactors are typically invoked by actions (controllers) after initial request processing and validation.  They are responsible for:

*   **Orchestrating Business Logic:**  Interactors coordinate interactions between entities, repositories, and other services to fulfill a specific user request.
*   **Input Validation (Beyond Basic Type Checking):**  While actions handle basic input validation (e.g., type coercion), interactors often perform more complex validation related to business rules.
*   **Authorization (Ideally):**  *Crucially*, interactors should be the primary location for authorization checks.  They should determine *whether* the current user is permitted to perform the requested operation *before* executing any core business logic.

The relationship between actions, interactors, and authorization is critical.  An action receives a request, performs initial validation, and then calls an interactor.  The interactor *must* verify that the user is authorized to perform the action *before* proceeding.  Failing to do so creates the vulnerability we are analyzing.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis: Common Flaws

Several common flaws can lead to improper authorization checks in Hanami interactors:

1.  **Missing Authorization Checks:** The most obvious vulnerability is the complete absence of authorization checks.  The interactor simply assumes that if it's called, the user is authorized.

2.  **Incorrect User Identification:** The interactor might attempt to perform authorization checks, but it relies on an unreliable or easily manipulated source for identifying the current user (e.g., a hidden form field, an unvalidated cookie).

3.  **Insufficient Granularity:** The authorization checks might be too broad.  For example, a check might verify that the user is an "admin," but not that they have permission to access a *specific* resource within the admin scope.

4.  **Bypassing Checks with Edge Cases:**  The authorization logic might have flaws that can be exploited with specific input values or sequences of actions.  For example, integer overflows, null byte injections, or unexpected data types could bypass checks.

5.  **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues:**  The interactor might check authorization at the beginning of the operation, but the user's permissions could change *during* the operation, leading to unauthorized access.  This is less common in web applications but still possible.

6.  **Leaking Authorization Information:** The interactor might inadvertently leak information about authorization rules or internal data structures, which an attacker could use to craft bypasses.

7.  **Ignoring Repository-Level Authorization:** Even if the interactor has checks, the underlying repository might not enforce them, allowing direct data access.

### 2.3 Exploitation Scenarios

Here are a few concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities:

*   **Scenario 1: Missing Checks (Direct Object Reference):**
    *   An interactor `UpdateUserProfile` takes a `user_id` as input and updates the corresponding user's profile.
    *   There are no authorization checks.
    *   An attacker can change the `user_id` in the request to update *any* user's profile, not just their own.

*   **Scenario 2: Insufficient Granularity (Admin Bypass):**
    *   An interactor `DeleteUser` checks if the user is an "admin."
    *   An attacker who is an admin can delete *any* user, even if they shouldn't have that specific permission (e.g., deleting a super-admin).

*   **Scenario 3: Incorrect User Identification (Cookie Manipulation):**
    *   An interactor `ViewOrder` retrieves the user ID from a cookie.
    *   An attacker can modify the cookie to impersonate another user and view their orders.

### 2.4 Code Examples (Vulnerable & Secure)

**Vulnerable Example (Missing Authorization):**

```ruby
# app/interactors/update_user_profile.rb
class UpdateUserProfile
  include Hanami::Interactor

  expose :user

  def call(user_id:, params:)
    @user = UserRepository.new.find(user_id)
    return unless @user

    @user = UserRepository.new.update(user_id, params)
  end
end
```

**Vulnerable Example (Insufficient Granularity):**

```ruby
# app/interactors/delete_user.rb
class DeleteUser
  include Hanami::Interactor

  expose :result

  def call(user_id:, current_user:)
    return unless current_user.admin? # Only checks for admin role

    UserRepository.new.delete(user_id)
    @result = true
  end
end
```

**Secure Example (Using a Policy Object):**

```ruby
# app/interactors/update_user_profile.rb
class UpdateUserProfile
  include Hanami::Interactor

  expose :user

  def call(user_id:, params:, current_user:)
    @user = UserRepository.new.find(user_id)
    return unless @user

    policy = UserPolicy.new(current_user, @user)
    error!('Unauthorized') unless policy.update? # Authorization check

    @user = UserRepository.new.update(user_id, params)
  end
end

# app/policies/user_policy.rb
class UserPolicy
  attr_reader :current_user, :target_user

  def initialize(current_user, target_user)
    @current_user = current_user
    @target_user = target_user
  end

  def update?
    current_user.admin? || current_user.id == target_user.id
  end

  # ... other policy methods ...
end
```

**Secure Example (Using Pundit):**

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'pundit'

# app/interactors/delete_user.rb
class DeleteUser
  include Hanami::Interactor
  include Pundit::Authorization # Include Pundit

  expose :result

  def call(user_id:, current_user:)
    user_to_delete = UserRepository.new.find(user_id)
    return unless user_to_delete

    authorize user_to_delete, :delete? # Pundit authorization check

    UserRepository.new.delete(user_id)
    @result = true
  end
end

# app/policies/user_policy.rb
class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def delete?
    user.admin? || record.id == user.id # Example policy
  end
end
```

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Centralized Authorization Logic:** Use a dedicated authorization library like Pundit or implement a consistent policy object pattern (as shown above).  This promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and makes it easier to audit and maintain authorization rules.

2.  **Authorize *Before* Business Logic:**  Always perform authorization checks *before* any data modification or retrieval within the interactor.  This prevents unauthorized actions from even starting.

3.  **Fine-Grained Permissions:**  Define granular permissions based on specific resources and actions.  Avoid overly broad roles like "admin" without further restrictions.

4.  **Secure User Identification:**  Rely on secure mechanisms for identifying the current user, such as session management provided by the framework (e.g., `request.session` in Hanami actions) and avoid relying on user-supplied data for identification.

5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not directly authorization, thorough input validation and sanitization can prevent many bypass techniques.

6.  **Repository-Level Enforcement:**  Consider enforcing authorization rules at the repository level as well, providing a second layer of defense.  This can be done using database constraints or custom repository methods.

7.  **Logging and Auditing:**  Log all authorization attempts (both successful and failed) with sufficient context (user, resource, action) to facilitate auditing and incident response.

8.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on authorization logic to identify potential vulnerabilities.

9.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

### 2.6 Testing Recommendations

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your policy objects or authorization logic to verify that they correctly grant or deny access based on different user roles and resource attributes.

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between actions, interactors, and repositories to ensure that authorization checks are correctly enforced throughout the request lifecycle.  Create test cases that attempt to access resources without the required permissions.

3.  **Negative Test Cases:**  Specifically design test cases that attempt to bypass authorization checks using various techniques (e.g., manipulating input parameters, modifying cookies, attempting to access resources directly).

4.  **Penetration Testing (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider engaging in penetration testing to identify more complex authorization vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tests.

### 2.7 Tooling and Resources

*   **Pundit:** A popular Ruby gem for authorization.  Provides a clean and organized way to define authorization policies.
*   **CanCanCan:** Another widely used authorization library for Ruby.
*   **Hanami Security:** While Hanami doesn't have a built-in authorization component, it provides the necessary building blocks (actions, interactors, sessions) to implement secure authorization.
*   **OWASP Cheat Sheet Series:**  Provides valuable guidance on various security topics, including authorization.
*   **Brakeman:** A static analysis security scanner for Ruby on Rails applications (can be adapted for Hanami).  It can help identify potential authorization vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

Improper authorization checks within Hanami interactors represent a significant security risk. By understanding the common vulnerabilities, exploitation scenarios, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can build more secure Hanami applications.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Centralize authorization logic.**
*   **Authorize *before* performing any business logic.**
*   **Use fine-grained permissions.**
*   **Test thoroughly, including negative test cases.**
*   **Leverage existing authorization libraries and tools.**

By consistently applying these principles, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of authorization-related vulnerabilities in their Hanami applications.
