# Deep Analysis: Overly Permissive Routes in Hanami Applications

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with overly permissive routes in Hanami applications, identify specific vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We aim to provide developers with the knowledge and tools to build secure routing configurations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the routing component of Hanami applications, as defined in `config/routes.rb` and related files.  It covers:

*   **Route Definition:**  How routes are declared, including the use of wildcards, constraints, and named routes.
*   **Route Matching:** How Hanami's router matches incoming requests to defined routes.
*   **Interaction with Controllers/Actions:** How routing configuration impacts access to controller actions.
*   **Authorization Bypass:**  How overly permissive routes can lead to bypassing intended authorization mechanisms.
*   **Testing and Verification:** Methods for identifying and testing for overly permissive routes.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors unrelated to routing (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   General Hanami application security best practices outside the scope of routing.
*   Specific deployment environments or infrastructure configurations.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine example Hanami routing configurations, highlighting both secure and insecure patterns.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific scenarios where overly permissive routes can lead to security vulnerabilities.
3.  **Exploitation Demonstration:**  Provide (conceptual) examples of how an attacker might exploit overly permissive routes.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Offer concrete, actionable steps for developers to prevent and mitigate this attack surface.
5.  **Testing Strategies:**  Describe testing techniques to identify and validate route security.
6.  **Tooling Analysis:**  Leverage Hanami's built-in tools (e.g., `hanami routes`) and potentially external security tools.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Overly Permissive Routes

### 4.1.  Understanding the Risk

Hanami's routing system, while powerful and flexible, can be a source of security vulnerabilities if not configured carefully.  The core risk stems from the ability to define routes that match a broader range of requests than intended, leading to unintended exposure of actions and data.

### 4.2.  Vulnerability Scenarios

Here are several specific scenarios illustrating how overly permissive routes can create vulnerabilities:

*   **Wildcard Abuse:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```ruby
        # config/routes.rb
        get "/admin/:anything", to: "admin#show"
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** This route matches *any* path starting with `/admin/`.  An attacker could access `/admin/delete_all_users`, `/admin/view_database_credentials`, or any other potentially sensitive action that might exist within the `admin` controller, even if those actions were not intended to be directly accessible.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft URLs to access unintended actions within the `admin` controller.

*   **Insufficient Constraints:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```ruby
        # config/routes.rb
        get "/users/:id", to: "users#show"
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** While seemingly harmless, this route doesn't constrain the `:id` parameter.  An attacker could try `/users/../config/database.yml` (path traversal) or `/users/admin` (if an "admin" user exists and the `show` action doesn't properly validate the ID type).
    *   **Exploitation:** Path traversal, accessing user data by guessing IDs, or potentially accessing data associated with non-numeric IDs.

*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```ruby
        # config/routes.rb
        get "/reports/:id", to: "reports#show"
        ```
        (and the `reports#show` action doesn't check if the current user is authorized to view the report with the given ID).
    *   **Explanation:**  Even if the route itself is reasonably specific, the *action* must perform authorization checks.  Relying solely on routing for access control is a major security flaw.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Unauthorized access to reports, potentially exposing sensitive data.

*   **Unintended Route Exposure via `hanami routes`:**
    *   **Explanation:**  The `hanami routes` command displays *all* defined routes.  Developers might inadvertently expose routes they didn't intend to be public.  This is an information disclosure vulnerability that aids attackers.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Attackers can use the output of `hanami routes` to map the application's attack surface and identify potential targets.

### 4.3.  Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing overly permissive routes:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Routing):**  Define routes with the *most specific* patterns possible.  Avoid broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary.

*   **Regular Expression Constraints:**  Use regular expressions to restrict parameter values:
    ```ruby
    # config/routes.rb
    get "/users/:id", to: "users#show", constraints: { id: /\d+/ }  # Only numeric IDs
    get "/articles/:slug", to: "articles#show", constraints: { slug: /[a-z0-9\-]+/ } # Alphanumeric slugs with hyphens
    ```

*   **Named Routes and Helpers:**  Use named routes (`as: :user_profile`) and their corresponding helpers (`routes.user_profile_path(id: 1)`) to generate URLs.  This reduces the risk of typos and makes routes more maintainable.

*   **Route Review with `hanami routes`:**  Regularly review the output of `hanami routes` to ensure that only intended routes are exposed.  This should be part of the development workflow and code review process.

*   **Robust Authorization *Within* Actions:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation.  **Never** rely solely on routing for access control.  Each action should independently verify that the current user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation.  Use a dedicated authorization library (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan) or implement custom authorization logic.
    ```ruby
    # app/actions/reports/show.rb
    class Reports::Show < Hanami::Action
      def handle(req, res)
        report = ReportRepository.new.find(req.params[:id])
        halt 404 unless report # Handle not found

        # Authorization check (example - replace with your authorization logic)
        halt 403 unless current_user.can_view?(report)

        res.body = report.content
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Negative Testing:**  Test *invalid* route patterns and parameter values to ensure they are rejected.  For example:
    *   Try accessing `/admin/../../etc/passwd` (path traversal).
    *   Try accessing `/users/abc` if the `:id` parameter should be numeric.
    *   Try accessing routes with excessively long parameter values.

*   **Automated Security Scanners:** Consider using automated security scanners that can detect overly permissive routes and other common web vulnerabilities.

*   **Input Validation:** While not directly related to routing, always validate and sanitize user input *within* actions to prevent other attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) that might be triggered even with seemingly secure routes.

### 4.4.  Testing Strategies

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual actions to ensure they handle invalid route parameters and unauthorized access attempts correctly.

*   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire request/response cycle, including routing and authorization, to verify that routes are correctly configured and access control is enforced.

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Have a security expert or experienced developer manually attempt to exploit potential routing vulnerabilities.

*   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to generate a large number of requests with various route patterns and parameter values to identify unexpected behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

Overly permissive routes are a significant security risk in Hanami applications. By understanding the principles of secure routing, employing robust authorization checks within actions, and rigorously testing route configurations, developers can significantly reduce this attack surface and build more secure applications.  The key takeaway is to treat routing as a *first line of defense*, but *never* the *only* line of defense.  Authorization must always be enforced within the application logic itself.
