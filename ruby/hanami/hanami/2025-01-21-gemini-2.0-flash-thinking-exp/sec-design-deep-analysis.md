## Deep Security Analysis of Hanami Web Framework (Version 1.1)

**Objective of Deep Analysis:**

To conduct a thorough security analysis of the Hanami web framework's design, as outlined in the provided Project Design Document (Version 1.1), identifying potential security vulnerabilities and proposing specific mitigation strategies. This analysis will focus on the key components of the framework and their interactions to understand the inherent security considerations.

**Scope:**

This analysis is limited to the architectural design of the Hanami web framework as described in the provided document. It will not cover specific application implementations built using Hanami, nor will it delve into the security of the underlying Ruby language or operating system. The focus is on the security implications arising from the framework's structure and component interactions.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of:

* **Design Review:** Examining the architecture and component responsibilities to identify potential security weaknesses.
* **Threat Modeling:**  Inferring potential threats based on the component functionalities and data flow.
* **Best Practices Application:**  Evaluating the design against established security principles and recommending Hanami-specific mitigations.

**Security Implications of Key Components:**

Here's a breakdown of the security implications for each key component of the Hanami framework:

**1. Router:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The Router, being the entry point for requests, is susceptible to DoS attacks if not protected against excessive or malformed requests. An attacker could flood the application with requests, overwhelming its resources.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Overly verbose or predictable route definitions could reveal internal application structure and endpoints to attackers, aiding in reconnaissance.
    * **Route Hijacking/Spoofing:**  If route matching logic is flawed or allows for ambiguity, attackers might be able to craft requests that are incorrectly routed to unintended actions.
    * **Parameter Tampering:**  While the Router itself doesn't process parameters deeply, vulnerabilities in how it extracts and passes parameters to Controllers could be exploited if not handled carefully downstream.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Implement rate limiting at the infrastructure level (e.g., using a reverse proxy like Nginx or a dedicated rate limiting service) to protect against DoS attacks.
    * Design route patterns that are less predictable and avoid exposing internal naming conventions.
    * Leverage Hanami's routing constraints to enforce specific formats and types for route parameters, reducing the attack surface.
    * Thoroughly test route definitions to ensure they behave as expected and do not have unintended overlaps or ambiguities.

**2. Controller:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Input Validation Failures:** Controllers receive user input and are a primary point for injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) if input is not properly validated and sanitized before being used.
    * **Authorization Bypass:**  If authorization checks are not implemented correctly within Controllers or their Actions, unauthorized users might be able to access or modify resources.
    * **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** If Controllers directly use request parameters to update Model attributes without proper filtering, attackers could modify unintended fields.
    * **Logic Flaws:**  Errors in the Controller's logic can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as allowing unintended state changes or data access.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Implement robust input validation within Controller Actions using Hanami's validation features or dedicated validation libraries. Employ a "whitelist" approach, explicitly defining allowed input.
    * Enforce authorization checks within Controller Actions before performing any sensitive operations. Consider using authorization libraries like Pundit or CanCanCan integrated with Hanami.
    * Utilize Hanami's parameter filtering mechanisms (strong parameters) to explicitly define which request parameters are permitted for mass assignment, preventing unintended modifications.
    * Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for Controller Actions to identify potential logic flaws and security vulnerabilities.

**3. Action:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Input Validation Issues:** Similar to Controllers, Actions are susceptible to injection vulnerabilities if they directly handle user input without proper validation and sanitization.
    * **Authorization Failures:**  Authorization logic within Actions must be correctly implemented to prevent unauthorized access to specific functionalities.
    * **Logic Flaws:**  Bugs in the Action's business logic can lead to security issues, such as incorrect data processing or unintended side effects.
    * **Data Exposure:** Actions might inadvertently expose sensitive data if not carefully designed to return only necessary information.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Apply input validation and sanitization within Actions, even if some validation is done at the Controller level, to ensure defense in depth.
    * Implement fine-grained authorization checks within Actions to control access to specific functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
    * Thoroughly test Action logic with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious data, to identify logic flaws.
    * Carefully review the data being prepared by Actions for Views or API responses to avoid exposing sensitive information unnecessarily.

**4. Interactor (Optional):**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in the complex business logic encapsulated within Interactors can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as allowing invalid state transitions or data manipulation.
    * **Data Integrity Issues:** If Interactors do not properly enforce business rules and data constraints, it can lead to inconsistent or corrupted data.
    * **Exposure of Internal Logic:** While not directly exposed to the user, vulnerabilities in Interactors could be exploited if other components (like Actions) are compromised.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Design Interactors with security in mind, ensuring they enforce all relevant business rules and data integrity constraints.
    * Implement thorough unit and integration tests for Interactors to validate their logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * Ensure that Actions interacting with Interactors pass validated and sanitized data to prevent Interactors from processing malicious input.

**5. Model:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Data Integrity Violations:** While Models primarily focus on data structure and business logic, vulnerabilities in their validation rules or relationships could lead to data integrity issues.
    * **Indirect Injection Risks:** If Models contain methods that directly execute database queries based on external input (though this is generally discouraged in Hanami's architecture), they could be susceptible to injection attacks.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Define comprehensive validation rules within Models to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid data from being persisted.
    * Avoid implementing direct database query execution within Models. Rely on Repositories for data access, which should handle query construction securely.

**6. Repository:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **SQL Injection:** Repositories are responsible for interacting with the database. If they construct SQL queries using unsanitized input, they are highly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    * **Data Access Control Issues:**  If Repositories do not properly enforce data access controls, unauthorized parts of the application might be able to access or modify sensitive data.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * **Crucially**, use parameterized queries or the data mapper's (like `rom-rb`) query builder features exclusively to construct database queries. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
    * Implement data access controls within Repositories to ensure that only authorized components can access or modify specific data. This might involve using database-level permissions or implementing application-level authorization within the Repository methods.

**7. Entity:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Data Integrity:** While Entities are simple data objects, ensuring their integrity is important. Incorrectly populated or manipulated Entities could lead to issues in other parts of the application.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Ensure that Entities are populated with validated data from Repositories or Interactors.
    * Treat Entities as immutable or use controlled mutation patterns to prevent unintended changes.

**8. View:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Views prepare data for rendering. If data is not properly escaped before being passed to Templates, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * Ensure that Views properly escape all user-provided data or data that could potentially contain malicious scripts before passing it to Templates. Utilize the auto-escaping features provided by Hanami's default template engine (ERB) or other template engines like Haml or Slim. Be mindful of the context of the output (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) and use appropriate escaping methods.

**9. Template:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Templates are responsible for rendering the final output. If they directly output unescaped user data, they are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

* **Tailored Mitigation Strategies for Hanami:**
    * **Always** use template engines with built-in auto-escaping features enabled. This will automatically escape output based on the context, preventing XSS vulnerabilities.
    * If you need to output raw HTML in specific cases, do so with extreme caution and ensure that the data being output is absolutely trusted and does not originate from user input.

* **Thorough Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for Controllers, Actions, and Interactors to identify logic flaws and security vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies (gems) up-to-date and regularly audit them for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundle audit`.
* **Secure Session Management:** Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for sessions and implement proper session invalidation.
* **CSRF Protection:** Ensure Hanami's built-in CSRF protection is enabled and correctly implemented in forms and AJAX requests.
* **Implement Security Headers:** Configure security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Frame-Options to enhance security.
* **Secure Error Handling and Logging:** Avoid displaying sensitive information in error messages and implement secure logging practices.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Database:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions.
* **Secure Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools.

By carefully considering these security implications and implementing the tailored mitigation strategies, development teams can build more secure applications using the Hanami web framework. Continuous security review and testing throughout the development lifecycle are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
