### 4. Deep Analysis of Mass Assignment Vulnerability

**Vulnerability:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the way Hanami actions can potentially interact with incoming request parameters and update model attributes. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **HTTP Request with Unexpected Parameters:** An attacker crafts an HTTP request (e.g., POST, PUT, PATCH) containing parameters that are not intended to be directly used for updating model attributes. These parameters might have malicious values or target sensitive attributes.

2. **Hanami Action Processing:** The Hanami action receives the request and accesses the parameters, typically through the `params` object.

3. **Direct Attribute Assignment (Vulnerable Code):**  The critical point of failure occurs when the Hanami action directly uses these unfiltered parameters to update model attributes. This could happen in several ways:

    * **Direct Assignment using `update` or similar methods:**  If the action directly passes the `params` object or a subset of it to a model's `update` method without proper filtering.
    * **Implicit Assignment through Data Mapping:** While Hanami encourages the use of form objects and strong parameters, developers might inadvertently rely on Hanami's data mapping capabilities in a way that allows unintended parameters to be mapped to model attributes.
    * **Lack of Explicit Whitelisting:**  The absence of a clear definition of which parameters are allowed to update specific model attributes leaves the application vulnerable to the inclusion of malicious parameters.

4. **Model Update with Malicious Data:**  The model is updated with the attacker-supplied data. This can lead to various consequences depending on the targeted attributes and the application's logic.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood (Medium):** The likelihood is considered medium because:
    * **Developer Oversight:** Developers might, under time pressure or due to a lack of awareness, directly use request parameters for model updates, especially in simpler actions.
    * **Framework Familiarity:**  While Hanami provides tools for secure parameter handling, developers new to the framework or those not fully understanding its nuances might make mistakes.
    * **Code Complexity:** In complex applications, it can be easy to overlook instances where direct parameter assignment is occurring.
* **Impact (Moderate to Significant):** The impact can range from moderate to significant depending on the affected data and the application's functionality:
    * **Data Integrity:** Attackers can modify sensitive data, leading to inconsistencies and incorrect information within the application. For example, changing a user's email address, password, or profile information.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  If attributes related to user roles or permissions are vulnerable, attackers could elevate their privileges within the application.
    * **Data Confidentiality:** In some cases, attackers might be able to access or modify data they are not authorized to see.
    * **Business Logic Bypass:**  Attackers could manipulate data to bypass intended business logic or workflows.

**Why it's a Critical Node:**

This attack path is considered a critical node because it directly impacts the core functionality and data integrity of the application. Successful exploitation can have severe consequences, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and reputational damage.

**Technical Details within Hanami Context:**

* **`params` Object:** Hanami provides the `params` object within actions to access request parameters. Directly using this object without filtering is a common pitfall.
* **Model `update` Method:**  Hanami models often have an `update` method that accepts a hash of attributes to modify. Passing unfiltered `params` to this method is a direct route to mass assignment.
* **Form Objects and Contracts:** Hanami encourages the use of form objects and contracts to define and validate expected parameters. Failure to implement these correctly can leave the application vulnerable.
* **Data Mappers:** While Hanami's data mappers are designed to handle data persistence, they don't inherently prevent mass assignment if the action passes unfiltered data to the mapper.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

* **User Profile Update:** An attacker could add an `is_admin` parameter to a user profile update request, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if the application directly uses the `params` to update the user model.
* **Product Price Manipulation:** In an e-commerce application, an attacker might try to modify the price of a product by including a `price` parameter in an update request.
* **Account Takeover:** By manipulating parameters related to email or password reset tokens, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

The primary mitigation is to **avoid directly using request parameters to update model attributes.** Here's a breakdown of effective strategies within the Hanami context:

1. **Strong Parameter Filtering and Whitelisting:**

    * **Explicitly Define Allowed Parameters:**  Within your Hanami actions, explicitly define the parameters that are allowed for updating specific model attributes. This can be done using techniques like:
        * **Manual Filtering:**  Creating a new hash containing only the allowed parameters.
        * **Using Hanami's Form Objects/Contracts:**  This is the recommended approach. Define a form object that specifies the expected parameters and their types. Hanami will automatically filter and validate the incoming parameters based on the form definition.

    ```ruby
    # Example using a Form Object (recommended)
    module Web::Actions::Users
      class Update < Web::Action
        include Deps[form: 'forms.user.update']

        def handle(params:)
          if form.validate(params[:user]).success?
            user_params = form.output
            # Update the user with the validated and filtered parameters
            UserRepository.new.update(params[:id], user_params)
            # ... rest of the action
          else
            # Handle validation errors
          end
        end
      end
    end

    # Example Form Object (forms/user/update.rb)
    module Forms::User
      class Update < Hanami::Action::Params
        params do
          required(:name).filled(:string)
          optional(:email).filled(:string, format: /@/)
          # Do NOT include sensitive or unintended parameters here
        end
      end
    end
    ```

2. **Explicit Attribute Assignment:**

    * **Manually Assign Attributes:** Instead of directly passing the `params` object, explicitly assign each allowed attribute to the model. This provides fine-grained control and prevents unintended parameters from being used.

    ```ruby
    # Example of explicit attribute assignment (less preferred than Form Objects for complex cases)
    module Web::Actions::Users
      class Update < Web::Action
        def handle(params:)
          user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])
          if user
            allowed_params = {}
            allowed_params[:name] = params[:user][:name] if params[:user][:name]
            allowed_params[:email] = params[:user][:email] if params[:user][:email]

            UserRepository.new.update(user.id, allowed_params)
            # ... rest of the action
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

3. **Code Reviews:**

    * **Regularly Review Code:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify instances where request parameters are being directly used for model updates without proper filtering.

4. **Static Analysis Tools:**

    * **Utilize Security Linters:** Employ static analysis tools that can detect potential mass assignment vulnerabilities by identifying patterns of direct parameter usage in model updates.

5. **Principle of Least Privilege:**

    * **Grant Only Necessary Access:** Ensure that users and roles within the application have only the necessary permissions to modify data. This can limit the impact of a successful mass assignment attack.

6. **Defense in Depth:**

    * **Implement Multiple Layers of Security:** Combine parameter filtering with other security measures like input validation, authorization checks, and regular security audits.

**Conclusion:**

The Mass Assignment vulnerability poses a significant risk to Hanami applications if developers are not careful about how they handle incoming request parameters. By understanding the attack vector and implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly leveraging Hanami's form objects and explicit parameter handling, development teams can effectively prevent this type of attack. Prioritizing secure coding practices and regular security reviews is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Hanami applications.
