### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: ORM Injection via Repository Manipulation

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The core of this attack lies in the ability of an attacker to inject malicious code or data into database queries through the Hanami repository layer. This occurs when user-supplied input is directly incorporated into the query construction process without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How it Works (Technical Details):**

1. **Vulnerable Repository Implementation:**  A Hanami repository, using ROM, might construct database queries dynamically based on user input. For example, consider a repository method that filters records based on a user-provided search term:

   ```ruby
   # Potentially vulnerable example
   class UsersRepository < Hanami::Repository
     def find_by_name(name)
       users.where("name = '#{name}'").one
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Malicious Input:** An attacker could provide a malicious `name` value, such as:

   ```
   ' OR 1=1 --
   ```

3. **Injected Query:** When this input is used in the vulnerable repository method, the resulting SQL query becomes:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --' LIMIT 1
   ```

   The injected `OR 1=1` clause makes the `WHERE` condition always true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all users. The `--` comments out the rest of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

4. **Exploitation:** Depending on the context and the attacker's goal, this can lead to various forms of exploitation:

   * **Data Breach:**  Retrieving sensitive data that the attacker should not have access to.
   * **Data Manipulation:**  Injecting `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to modify or remove data. For example, an attacker could inject:

     ```sql
     '; DELETE FROM users; --
     ```

     Leading to the query:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ''; DELETE FROM users; --' LIMIT 1
     ```

     While the `SELECT` might fail, the injected `DELETE` statement could be executed depending on the database driver and configuration.
   * **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, manipulating queries related to user roles or permissions could lead to privilege escalation.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  The likelihood of this attack depends heavily on the development practices within the team. If developers are aware of ORM injection risks and consistently use secure coding practices, the likelihood is lower. However, if dynamic query construction based on user input is prevalent, the likelihood increases. We assess it as **low to medium**.
* **Impact:** The impact of a successful ORM injection can be **significant to critical**. As highlighted in the initial description, it can lead to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Exposure of sensitive user data, financial information, etc.
    * **Data Manipulation:**  Corruption or deletion of critical application data.
    * **Database Compromise:**  In severe cases, attackers could gain control over the entire database server.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from users and stakeholders.
    * **Financial Losses:**  Due to fines, legal actions, and recovery efforts.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

The primary mitigation strategies revolve around preventing the direct inclusion of user input into raw SQL queries.

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective defense. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. ROM supports parameterized queries implicitly when using its query builder.

   ```ruby
   # Secure example using parameterized queries
   class UsersRepository < Hanami::Repository
     def find_by_name(name)
       users.where(name: name).one
     end
   end
   ```

   In this example, ROM will automatically handle the parameterization of the `name` variable, preventing injection.

* **ROM's Query Builder:**  Utilize ROM's query builder methods to construct queries programmatically. This approach abstracts away the direct construction of SQL strings and encourages the use of safe methods.

   ```ruby
   # Secure example using ROM's query builder
   class UsersRepository < Hanami::Repository
     def find_by_partial_name(partial_name)
       users.where { like(:name, "%#{partial_name}%") }.to_a
     end
   end
   ```

   Even with operations like `like`, ROM handles the escaping and quoting appropriately.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against ORM injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help reduce the attack surface. However, relying solely on input validation is insufficient as new attack vectors can emerge.

* **Code Reviews:** Regular code reviews by security-aware developers can help identify potential ORM injection vulnerabilities before they reach production.

* **Static Analysis Tools:**  Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential security vulnerabilities, including ORM injection flaws.

**Specific Attack Scenarios:**

* **Filtering/Searching:** As demonstrated in the initial example, vulnerabilities often arise in features that allow users to filter or search data based on their input.
* **Sorting:** If the sorting criteria are derived from user input without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious code into the `ORDER BY` clause.
* **Dynamic Conditions:**  Any scenario where the `WHERE` clause or other parts of the SQL query are constructed dynamically based on user input is a potential risk.
* **Repository Methods Accepting Raw SQL:** If repositories expose methods that allow developers to pass raw SQL fragments, this significantly increases the risk of injection if not handled with extreme care.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured to detect and block suspicious SQL injection attempts, including those targeting ORM layers.
* **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM tools can monitor database queries for unusual patterns or malicious commands.
* **Logging:**  Comprehensive logging of database queries can help in identifying potential attacks after they occur.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Network-based IDS can detect suspicious network traffic associated with database attacks.

**Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Adopt a "Secure by Default" Mindset:**  Prioritize secure coding practices from the beginning of the development lifecycle.
* **Educate Developers:**  Ensure developers are aware of ORM injection risks and how to prevent them.
* **Enforce Code Review Processes:**  Mandatory code reviews with a security focus.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify vulnerabilities through security assessments.
* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Ensure Hanami, ROM, and database drivers are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The "ORM Injection via Repository Manipulation" attack path represents a significant security risk for Hanami applications. While the Hanami and ROM frameworks provide tools for secure database interaction (like parameterized queries and the query builder), developers must be diligent in their implementation to avoid introducing vulnerabilities. By understanding the mechanics of this attack, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and fostering a security-conscious development culture, the risk of successful exploitation can be significantly reduced. This critical node requires immediate attention and consistent adherence to secure coding practices.
