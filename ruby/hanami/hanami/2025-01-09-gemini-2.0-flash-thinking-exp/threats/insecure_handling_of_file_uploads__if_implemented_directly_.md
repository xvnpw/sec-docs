## Deep Dive Threat Analysis: Insecure Handling of File Uploads in Hanami

**Threat:** Insecure Handling of File Uploads (if implemented directly)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the potential security risks associated with manually implementing file upload functionality within a Hanami application's controller actions, without leveraging secure libraries or adhering to established best practices.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Threat:**

While Hanami itself doesn't inherently provide a built-in file upload mechanism, developers might choose to implement it directly within their controller actions. This often involves interacting with the raw request data to process uploaded files. The danger lies in the numerous potential pitfalls of this manual approach, leading to various security vulnerabilities.

**Why is manual implementation risky?**

* **Lack of Built-in Security:**  Hanami's core doesn't enforce any file upload security measures by default. Developers are solely responsible for implementing all necessary checks and sanitization.
* **Complexity and Human Error:** Securely handling file uploads is a complex task involving multiple layers of validation and security considerations. Manual implementation increases the likelihood of overlooking crucial steps or making mistakes.
* **Reinventing the Wheel:**  Well-established and vetted libraries exist specifically to handle file uploads securely. Implementing it from scratch is inefficient and potentially introduces vulnerabilities that have already been addressed by these libraries.

**2. Detailed Breakdown of Potential Vulnerabilities:**

Directly handling file uploads without proper precautions can lead to a range of vulnerabilities:

* **Unrestricted File Uploads:**
    * **Description:**  The application might not impose any restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can upload executable files (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.py`, `.sh`) which, if placed within the web server's document root or a reachable directory, can be executed, leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
    * **Hanami Specifics:** Hanami's routing mechanism could potentially expose these uploaded files if they are placed in a publicly accessible directory.
* **Filename Manipulation and Path Traversal:**
    * **Description:** The application might not properly sanitize filenames provided by the user.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can craft filenames containing special characters like `../` to navigate the file system and overwrite critical system files or place malicious files in unintended locations.
    * **Hanami Specifics:**  If the controller action directly uses the unsanitized filename to construct the file path for saving, this vulnerability is highly likely.
* **Insufficient File Type Validation:**
    * **Description:** Relying solely on file extensions for validation is insecure. Extensions can be easily manipulated.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker can rename a malicious executable file (e.g., `malware.exe`) to an allowed extension (e.g., `image.jpg`) to bypass basic checks.
    * **Hanami Specifics:**  Without implementing content-based validation, Hanami applications are susceptible to this bypass.
* **Lack of File Size Limits:**
    * **Description:** The application might not enforce limits on the size of uploaded files.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can upload extremely large files, leading to **Denial of Service (DoS)** by consuming server resources (disk space, bandwidth).
    * **Hanami Specifics:** This can impact the performance and availability of the Hanami application.
* **Insecure Storage Location:**
    * **Description:** Storing uploaded files directly within the web server's document root without proper access controls.
    * **Exploitation:**  Allows direct access to uploaded files via HTTP, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing execution of malicious files.
    * **Hanami Specifics:**  If the `public` directory or a subdirectory within it is used for storage without proper configuration, this vulnerability exists.
* **Race Conditions:**
    * **Description:**  If multiple file uploads are processed concurrently without proper synchronization, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
    * **Exploitation:**  Attackers might exploit race conditions to overwrite legitimate files with malicious ones.
    * **Hanami Specifics:**  Hanami's concurrency model needs to be considered when implementing file upload handling.
* **Exif Metadata Exploitation:**
    * **Description:**  Uploaded image files can contain metadata (EXIF) which might contain sensitive information or even malicious code in some cases.
    * **Exploitation:**  Attackers can extract sensitive data or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in EXIF parsing libraries.
    * **Hanami Specifics:**  If the application processes or displays uploaded images without stripping metadata, this risk exists.

**3. Impact Amplification in a Hanami Context:**

* **Direct Controller Exposure:** Hanami's emphasis on explicit routing means that controller actions handling file uploads are directly exposed through defined routes. A vulnerability in these actions can be easily exploited.
* **Potential Integration with Other Components:**  Uploaded files might be processed or integrated with other parts of the Hanami application (e.g., database interactions, background jobs). A successful attack could therefore have cascading effects.
* **Developer Mindset:**  While Hanami encourages best practices, the flexibility it offers might tempt developers to take shortcuts and implement file uploads manually without fully understanding the security implications.

**4. Elaborating on Mitigation Strategies (with Hanami Focus):**

* **Utilize well-vetted file upload libraries or gems:**
    * **Recommendation:** Integrate gems like `shrine`, `carrierwave`, or `refile`. These libraries provide robust features for handling file uploads securely, including validation, storage management, and processing.
    * **Hanami Integration:** These gems can be easily integrated into Hanami applications and used within controller actions or dedicated interactors.
* **Implement robust file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just extension:**
    * **Recommendation:** Use libraries that can inspect the file's binary content (magic numbers or MIME types) to accurately determine its type, regardless of the file extension.
    * **Hanami Implementation:** This validation logic can be incorporated into the controller action or within the file upload library's configuration.
* **Enforce strict file size limits:**
    * **Recommendation:** Configure maximum allowed file sizes at the application level and potentially at the web server level (e.g., Nginx, Puma).
    * **Hanami Implementation:** This can be enforced within the controller action or through the chosen file upload library's configuration.
* **Store uploaded files in secure locations with appropriate access controls, ideally outside the web server's document root:**
    * **Recommendation:** Store uploaded files in a directory inaccessible directly via HTTP. Use a unique, non-guessable naming scheme for files.
    * **Hanami Implementation:** Configure the file upload library to store files outside the `public` directory. Serve files through a dedicated controller action that performs authorization checks before serving the file.
* **Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities:**
    * **Recommendation:**  Remove or replace potentially dangerous characters from filenames. Generate unique, safe filenames on the server-side.
    * **Hanami Implementation:** Implement filename sanitization logic within the controller action or leverage the file upload library's built-in sanitization features.
* **Consider using a dedicated storage service for uploaded files:**
    * **Recommendation:** Utilize cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. These services offer robust security features, scalability, and offload storage management from the application server.
    * **Hanami Integration:** Libraries like `shrine` and `carrierwave` have direct integrations with these cloud storage providers.
* **Implement proper error handling and logging:**
    * **Recommendation:** Log all file upload attempts, including successes and failures, along with relevant details. Handle errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    * **Hanami Implementation:** Utilize Hanami's logging capabilities to record file upload events.
* **Regularly update dependencies:**
    * **Recommendation:** Keep all gems and libraries used for file upload handling up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Hanami Practice:** Regularly run `bundle update` to ensure dependencies are current.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Recommendation:** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities related to uploaded content.
    * **Hanami Implementation:**  CSP headers can be configured within the Hanami application's middleware.

**5. Testing and Verification:**

* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify the file upload validation logic and ensure that malicious files are rejected.
* **Integration Tests:** Test the entire file upload flow, including how files are stored and accessed.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the file upload implementation.

**Conclusion:**

Insecure handling of file uploads represents a critical security risk for Hanami applications if implemented directly without proper security considerations. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. Leveraging well-vetted file upload libraries and adhering to secure development practices are crucial for building robust and secure Hanami applications. It's essential to prioritize security from the initial design phase and continuously review and update file upload handling logic to address emerging threats.
