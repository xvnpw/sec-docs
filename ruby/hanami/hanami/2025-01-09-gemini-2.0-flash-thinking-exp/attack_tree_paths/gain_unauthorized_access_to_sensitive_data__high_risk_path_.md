## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (Hanami Application)

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data" within a Hanami application. We will examine each node, detailing the attack vector, potential impact, and specific considerations within the Hanami framework.

**OVERARCHING GOAL: Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK PATH]**

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Successfully navigating any of the sub-paths directly leads to a breach of confidentiality, potentially exposing sensitive user data, financial information, or proprietary business data. The impact of such a breach can be severe, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, legal repercussions, and loss of customer trust.

**PATH 1: Exploit Hanami's Action Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]**

Hanami actions are the core of the application's request handling logic. Vulnerabilities here allow attackers to bypass intended access controls and manipulate application behavior.

**NODE 1.1: Missing Authorization Checks in Actions [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** This is a fundamental flaw where actions responsible for handling sensitive data or operations lack proper checks to verify if the current user or request has the necessary permissions. This often stems from developers forgetting to implement authorization logic or making mistakes in its implementation.

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly target these unprotected actions. They might:
    * **Manipulate URL parameters:**  As highlighted in the example, attackers can change user IDs or other identifiers in the URL to access resources belonging to other users.
    * **Forge requests:**  Attackers can craft HTTP requests that mimic legitimate actions but bypass the intended user interface or workflow, directly invoking the vulnerable action.
    * **Exploit predictable resource identifiers:** If resource IDs are sequential or easily guessable, attackers can iterate through them to access unauthorized data.

* **Example (Detailed):**
    * **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical Hanami Action):**
      ```ruby
      module Web::Controllers::Users
        class Show
          include Web::Action

          params do
            required(:id).filled(:integer)
          end

          def call(params)
            @user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])
            if @user
              @status = 200
            else
              @status = 404
            end
          end
        end
      end
      ```
      In this example, there's no check to ensure the currently logged-in user is the same user whose profile is being requested. An attacker could simply change the `id` in the URL (e.g., `/users/2` when logged in as user 1) to view another user's profile.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive user information (personal details, contact information, etc.).
        * **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to perform actions they are not authorized for, such as modifying other users' data or triggering administrative functions.
        * **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to breaches of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

    * **Hanami Specific Considerations:**
        * Hanami provides mechanisms for handling parameters and routing, but the responsibility for implementing authorization logic lies with the developer within the action.
        * Consider using Hanami's built-in features or external gems for authorization, such as `pundit` or `cancancan`.
        * Implement authorization checks early in the action's `call` method.
        * Utilize the `current_user` or similar mechanism to identify the authenticated user.

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement robust authorization checks:** Verify the user's permissions before accessing or manipulating sensitive data.
        * **Utilize authorization libraries:** Integrate gems like `pundit` or `cancancan` to enforce authorization policies.
        * **Implement role-based access control (RBAC):** Define roles and assign permissions to them, then assign users to roles.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
        * **Thorough code reviews:**  Specifically look for missing or incorrect authorization checks.
        * **Automated security testing:** Use tools to identify potential authorization vulnerabilities.

**PATH 2: Exploit Hanami's Entity/Repository Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]**

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Hanami interacts with the database through its Entities and Repositories.

**NODE 2.1: Insecure Query Construction (Hanami::Model) [CRITICAL NODE]**

* **Description:** This vulnerability, commonly known as SQL Injection, occurs when user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code that can manipulate the database.

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used to construct database queries. This can happen through:
    * **Form inputs:**  Exploiting search fields, login forms, or any other input field that is used in database queries.
    * **URL parameters:**  Injecting SQL code into query parameters in the URL.
    * **HTTP headers:**  Less common, but potentially exploitable if header values are used in query construction.

* **Example (Detailed):**
    * **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical Hanami Repository):**
      ```ruby
      class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository
        def find_by_username(username)
          sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{username}'"
          adapter.connection.execute(sql).first
        end
      end
      ```
      If an attacker provides the username `'; DROP TABLE users; --`, the resulting SQL query would be:
      `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'`
      This would first select users with an empty username (likely none) and then, critically, drop the entire `users` table. The `--` comments out the rest of the query.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Breach:**  Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
        * **Data Manipulation:**  Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
        * **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass login mechanisms by injecting SQL to return valid user credentials.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can execute queries that overload the database server.

    * **Hanami Specific Considerations:**
        * Hanami::Model provides a convenient way to interact with the database, but developers must be mindful of secure query construction.
        * **Parameterized queries are the primary defense against SQL injection.** Hanami::Model supports parameterized queries through its query builder methods.

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries:**  This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code. Hanami::Model's query builder encourages this.
          ```ruby
          class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository
            def find_by_username(username)
              users.where(username: username).first
            end
          end
          ```
        * **Input validation and sanitization:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sanitize it to remove potentially malicious characters. However, this is a secondary defense and should not be relied upon as the primary protection against SQL injection.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):**  Grant database users only the necessary permissions. Avoid using database accounts with `root` or `admin` privileges for application connections.
        * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts.
        * **Regular security audits and penetration testing:**  Identify and address potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**PATH 3: Exploit Hanami's Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]**

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the Hanami application is configured and deployed.

**NODE 3.1: Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]**

* **Description:** This vulnerability arises when sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, API keys, secret keys, or other confidential information, is exposed to unauthorized individuals.

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can gain access to this data through various means:
    * **Publicly accessible configuration files:**  Files like `.env` or configuration files within the application's codebase are accidentally left accessible through the web server.
    * **Insecure server configuration:**  Incorrectly configured web servers might expose files or directories that should be protected.
    * **Version control system leaks:**  Sensitive data committed to public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or accessible through misconfigured private repositories.
    * **Compromised development or staging environments:**  Attackers gaining access to less secure environments might find sensitive configuration data.
    * **Information disclosure vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting other vulnerabilities to read configuration files.

* **Example (Detailed):**
    * **Scenario:** A developer accidentally commits a `.env` file containing database credentials to a public GitHub repository. An attacker discovers this repository and gains access to the database credentials.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Complete System Compromise:**  Database credentials allow direct access to the application's data, enabling data breaches, manipulation, and deletion.
        * **API Key Abuse:**  Exposed API keys can be used to access external services, potentially incurring costs or causing damage.
        * **Secret Key Compromise:**  Secret keys used for encryption, session management, or signing tokens, if exposed, can lead to authentication bypass, data decryption, and other severe security issues.

    * **Hanami Specific Considerations:**
        * Hanami applications often utilize `.env` files for environment-specific configurations. It's crucial to manage these files securely.
        * Be mindful of how Hanami handles configuration settings and ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed in logs or error messages.

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never commit sensitive data to version control:**  Use `.gitignore` to exclude files like `.env` and other configuration files containing secrets.
        * **Utilize environment variables:**  Store sensitive configuration data as environment variables on the server instead of directly in configuration files. Hanami can access these variables.
        * **Secure file permissions:**  Ensure that configuration files are not publicly readable on the server.
        * **Secrets management tools:**  Consider using dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive credentials.
        * **Regular security audits of server configurations:**  Ensure web servers are configured to prevent access to sensitive files.
        * **Secure development and deployment pipelines:**  Implement secure practices throughout the development lifecycle to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
        * **Regularly rotate credentials:**  Change sensitive credentials periodically to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

**Conclusion:**

The "Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data" path highlights critical vulnerabilities that can significantly impact the security of a Hanami application. By understanding the attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect sensitive data. A layered security approach, combining secure coding practices, robust authorization mechanisms, secure configuration management, and ongoing security monitoring, is essential for building resilient and secure Hanami applications.
