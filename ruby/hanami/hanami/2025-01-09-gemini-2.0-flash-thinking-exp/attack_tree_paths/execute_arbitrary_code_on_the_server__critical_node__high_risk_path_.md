## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server (Hanami Application)

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server" within the context of a Hanami application. This is a critical path representing a high-risk scenario where an attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to complete compromise.

**Overall Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]**

This represents the ultimate objective of a malicious actor targeting the Hanami application. Successful execution of arbitrary code grants the attacker complete control over the server, allowing them to:

* **Steal sensitive data:** Access databases, configuration files, user credentials, and other confidential information.
* **Modify application behavior:** Inject malicious code to alter functionality, redirect users, or perform unauthorized actions.
* **Establish persistence:** Install backdoors or create new user accounts to maintain access even after the initial vulnerability is patched.
* **Launch further attacks:** Use the compromised server as a staging ground to attack other systems within the network.
* **Cause denial of service:** Overload the server resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Path 1: Exploit Hanami's Action Vulnerabilities (leading to code execution) [HIGH RISK PATH]**

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within the Hanami application's own code, specifically within the actions that handle user requests and process data.

**Sub-Path 1.1: Command Injection via Parameter Handling [CRITICAL NODE]**

This is a particularly dangerous vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious commands into parameters that are subsequently used in system calls or to execute external processes.

**Attack Vector:**

* **Vulnerable Code Location:**  This vulnerability arises when Hanami actions directly use user-supplied input (from request parameters, headers, etc.) within functions that execute shell commands or interact with the operating system. This often occurs when developers need to interact with external utilities or perform system-level operations.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence or inadequacy of input validation and sanitization. If the application doesn't properly check and sanitize user input before using it in system commands, attackers can inject their own commands.
* **Commonly Affected Areas:**
    * **File Uploads:** Processing filenames or paths without proper validation.
    * **Image Processing:** Using external tools like `imagemagick` with unsanitized input for resizing or manipulation.
    * **System Utilities:** Calling command-line tools like `ping`, `grep`, `awk`, etc., with user-provided arguments.
    * **Database Interactions (less common in direct command injection):** While less direct, poorly constructed database queries (SQL injection) can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.

**Example:**

Consider a Hanami action that allows users to download a file based on a filename provided in a parameter:

```ruby
# Vulnerable Hanami Action
module Web::Controllers::Download
  class Index
    include Web::Action

    expose :file_path

    def call(params)
      @file_path = "public/uploads/#{params[:filename]}" # Potentially vulnerable

      # Execute a system command to serve the file (simplified for example)
      system("cat #{@file_path}")
    end
  end
end
```

An attacker could craft a request like: `/?filename=important.txt; cat /etc/passwd`

In this scenario, the `system` command would execute: `cat public/uploads/important.txt; cat /etc/passwd`. The semicolon allows the attacker to chain commands, potentially exposing sensitive system files.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid System Calls with User Input:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid directly using user-provided input in system commands whenever possible. Explore alternative approaches using Ruby's built-in libraries or safer methods.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation rules for all user input. Sanitize input by removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, backticks). Use whitelisting to allow only known safe characters or patterns.
* **Use Parameterized Commands:** When interacting with external processes, use libraries or functions that support parameterized commands, which prevent command injection by treating user input as data rather than executable code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Hanami application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the impact of a successful command injection attack.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review code for potential command injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to identify suspicious patterns.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Input Validation Failures:** Monitor logs for instances where input validation rules are triggered, indicating potential malicious attempts.
* **Unusual System Calls:** Monitor system logs for unexpected or suspicious system calls originating from the Hanami application's process.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common command injection patterns in incoming requests.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Utilize IDS to identify malicious activity on the server based on network traffic and system behavior.

**Path 2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hanami's Dependencies (Specific to Hanami's ecosystem) [HIGH RISK PATH]**

Hanami applications rely on a collection of Ruby gems (libraries) to provide various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to achieve code execution.

**Sub-Path 2.1: Vulnerabilities in Used Gems [CRITICAL NODE]**

This path highlights the risk of using third-party libraries with known security flaws.

**Attack Vector:**

* **Publicly Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Attackers often target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in popular Ruby gems. Databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Ruby Advisory Database track these vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management Issues:** Failing to keep dependencies up-to-date is a major risk factor. Older versions of gems are more likely to have known vulnerabilities.
* **Transitive Dependencies:** Vulnerabilities can exist not only in the direct dependencies of the Hanami application but also in the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies).
* **Exploitation Methods:** The specific exploitation method depends on the vulnerability in the gem. Common examples include:
    * **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting flaws in how gems handle the deserialization of data (e.g., YAML, JSON), allowing attackers to inject malicious objects that execute code upon deserialization.
    * **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (in database adapter gems):** While less direct for code execution, these can be chained with other vulnerabilities.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities:** Some gem vulnerabilities directly allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted input.

**Example:**

Consider a Hanami application using an older version of the `json` gem with a known deserialization vulnerability. An attacker could send a specially crafted JSON payload to the application that, when parsed by the vulnerable gem, executes arbitrary Ruby code on the server.

```ruby
# Vulnerable JSON gem example (conceptual)
require 'json'

# Potentially vulnerable code in a Hanami action
def call(params)
  user_data = JSON.parse(params[:data]) # If 'data' contains malicious JSON
  # ... process user_data ...
end
```

The malicious JSON payload could contain instructions to execute system commands when deserialized.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Use a Gemfile.lock:** Ensure that your `Gemfile.lock` is committed to version control to maintain consistent dependency versions across environments.
    * **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Use tools like `bundle update` (with caution and testing) or `bundle outdated` to identify and update vulnerable gems.
    * **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate tools like `bundle audit`, `Dependabot`, or Snyk into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
* **Security Audits of Dependencies:**  Review the security advisories and changelogs of the gems your application uses.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If a gem has a history of security vulnerabilities, consider switching to a more secure alternative if one exists.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Client-Side Dependencies:** While less relevant for server-side code execution, using SRI for client-side JavaScript libraries can prevent attackers from injecting malicious code through compromised CDNs.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Regularly run dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Monitor logs for indicators of compromise related to known gem vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** RASP solutions can detect and prevent exploitation attempts targeting known vulnerabilities in dependencies at runtime.

**Conclusion:**

The "Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server" attack path represents a critical threat to any Hanami application. Both exploiting Hanami's own code (through command injection) and leveraging vulnerabilities in its dependencies pose significant risks.

**Key Takeaways for the Development Team:**

* **Security is a Continuous Process:**  Security should be integrated into every stage of the development lifecycle, from design and coding to deployment and maintenance.
* **Prioritize Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
* **Minimize System Calls with User Input:**  Avoid directly using user input in system commands whenever possible.
