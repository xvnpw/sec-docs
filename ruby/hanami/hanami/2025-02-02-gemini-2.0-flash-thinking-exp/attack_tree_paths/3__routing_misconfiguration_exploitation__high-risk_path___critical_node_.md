## Deep Analysis: Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation - Attack Tree Path

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation" attack tree path, specifically focusing on "Route Parameter Manipulation" and its potential vulnerabilities within a Hanami application context. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the risks and implement appropriate security measures.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation" attack path, specifically focusing on "Route Parameter Manipulation" leading to vulnerabilities like Path Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) within a Hanami application.  The goal is to:

* **Understand the attack vector:** Detail how attackers can exploit route parameter manipulation in Hanami applications.
* **Identify potential vulnerabilities:** Pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that can arise from this attack vector, focusing on Path Traversal, LFI, and RFI.
* **Assess the impact:** Evaluate the potential consequences of successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
* **Recommend mitigation strategies:** Provide actionable and Hanami-specific recommendations to prevent and mitigate these risks.
* **Justify risk level:** Explain why this attack path is classified as "HIGH-RISK" and the node as "CRITICAL".

### 2. Scope

This analysis is strictly scoped to the following attack tree path:

**3. Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Route Parameter Manipulation (e.g., path traversal if routes handle file paths directly) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Vulnerabilities:** Path Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

We will focus on how these vulnerabilities can manifest in a Hanami application due to insecure routing configurations and how to prevent them.  This analysis will not cover other types of routing misconfigurations or other branches of the attack tree.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ the following methodology:

1. **Vulnerability Definition:** Clearly define Path Traversal, LFI, and RFI vulnerabilities in the context of web applications.
2. **Hanami Routing Context:** Explain how Hanami routing works and how route parameters are handled within the framework.
3. **Attack Vector Explanation:** Detail how an attacker can manipulate route parameters to exploit the identified vulnerabilities in a Hanami application.
4. **Impact Assessment:** Analyze the potential impact of successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5. **Hanami Specific Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide concrete and actionable mitigation strategies tailored to Hanami applications, leveraging Hanami's features and best practices.
6. **Risk Justification:** Explain the rationale behind classifying this attack path as "HIGH-RISK" and the node as "CRITICAL".

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 3. Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This node highlights the critical risk associated with misconfigured routing in Hanami applications.  Incorrect or insecure routing configurations can directly expose internal application logic and resources to unauthorized access and manipulation.  This is considered a **CRITICAL NODE** because routing is a fundamental aspect of any web application, and vulnerabilities here can have widespread and severe consequences. The "HIGH-RISK PATH" designation emphasizes the potential for significant damage if this area is not properly secured.

#### * **Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This sub-node focuses on the exploitation of vulnerabilities specifically arising from routing configurations.  Attackers actively seek out weaknesses in how routes are defined and processed to bypass intended access controls or gain unauthorized functionality. This is a **HIGH-RISK PATH** because successful exploitation often leads to direct access to sensitive data or application functionalities.

####     * **Route Parameter Manipulation (e.g., path traversal if routes handle file paths directly) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This is the core focus of our deep analysis.  **Route Parameter Manipulation** occurs when an attacker modifies parameters within the URL path to achieve unintended actions. The example provided, "path traversal if routes handle file paths directly," is a classic and potent example. This path is marked as **HIGH-RISK** because it directly targets a common and often overlooked vulnerability in web applications, and successful exploitation can be relatively straightforward for attackers.

#####         * **Vulnerabilities:** Path Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

Let's delve into each of these vulnerabilities within the Hanami context:

######             * **Path Traversal:**

**Definition:** Path Traversal (also known as Directory Traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's root directory. This occurs when user-supplied input, intended to specify a file path, is not properly validated and sanitized. Attackers can inject special characters like `../` (dot-dot-slash) to navigate up the directory tree and access sensitive files.

**Hanami Context:** In a Hanami application, if a route is designed to handle file paths directly as parameters, and these parameters are used to construct file system paths without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to Path Traversal.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION):**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (VULNERABLE EXAMPLE)
get '/files/:filepath', to: 'files#show'

# app/controllers/files/show.rb (VULNERABLE EXAMPLE)
module Web
  module Controllers
    module Files
      class Show
        include Web::Action

        def call(params)
          filepath = params[:filepath] # User-supplied input directly used
          full_path = File.join('./public/uploads', filepath) # Potentially vulnerable path construction

          if File.exist?(full_path)
            send_file(full_path)
          else
            halt 404, 'File not found'
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Attack Example:** An attacker could request `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application is vulnerable, it might attempt to access and serve the `/etc/passwd` file, which is outside the intended `./public/uploads` directory.

**Impact:**
* **Information Disclosure (High):** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, application source code, database credentials, and user data.
* **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Medium to High - Context Dependent):** In some scenarios, if attackers can upload files or manipulate other system components through path traversal, it could potentially lead to RCE.

######             * **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**

**Definition:** LFI is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include (execute) arbitrary local files on the server. This typically occurs when an application dynamically includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. While conceptually similar to Path Traversal, LFI often involves the *execution* of included files, which can have more severe consequences.

**Hanami Context:**  If a Hanami application uses route parameters to determine which local file to include or process (e.g., for templating or configuration loading), and this parameter is not properly validated, it can be vulnerable to LFI.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION):**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (VULNERABLE EXAMPLE)
get '/templates/:template_name', to: 'templates#show'

# app/controllers/templates/show.rb (VULNERABLE EXAMPLE)
module Web
  module Controllers
    module Templates
      class Show
        include Web::Action

        def call(params)
          template_name = params[:template_name] # User-supplied input
          template_path = File.join('./app/views/templates', "#{template_name}.erb") # Constructing path

          if File.exist?(template_path)
            render template_path # Potentially vulnerable file inclusion
          else
            halt 404, 'Template not found'
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Attack Example:** An attacker could request `/templates/../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application is vulnerable, it might attempt to include and potentially execute the contents of `/etc/passwd` as a template (though execution depends on the context and file type). More realistically, they might include application files to understand logic or find vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
* **Information Disclosure (High):** Attackers can read sensitive files, including application code, configuration, and potentially data.
* **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) (High):** If the included files are interpreted as code (e.g., PHP, ERB templates with embedded code), attackers can inject malicious code and achieve RCE.

######             * **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (Less Common in Hanami Context but Conceptually Related):**

**Definition:** RFI is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include (execute) arbitrary *remote* files on the server. This is similar to LFI but involves including files from external sources, often controlled by the attacker. RFI is generally less common in modern frameworks and configurations due to security awareness and server-side protections.

**Hanami Context:** RFI is less directly applicable to typical Hanami routing scenarios. Hanami, being a Ruby framework, doesn't inherently have built-in functions that directly facilitate RFI in the same way some scripting languages with `include`/`require` functions might when used with user-supplied URLs. However, if a Hanami application were to *intentionally* implement functionality that fetches and executes code from remote URLs based on route parameters (which is highly discouraged and insecure), it could be vulnerable to RFI.

**Example (Highly Unlikely and Insecure Hanami Scenario - DO NOT IMPLEMENT):**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AND UNLIKELY EXAMPLE)
get '/remote_script/:url', to: 'remote_script#execute'

# app/controllers/remote_script/execute.rb (EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AND UNLIKELY EXAMPLE)
module Web
  module Controllers
    module RemoteScript
      class Execute
        include Web::Action

        def call(params)
          remote_url = params[:url] # User-supplied URL
          # ... INSECURELY fetching and executing code from remote_url ...
          # This is a highly contrived and dangerous example.
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Impact (If RFI were possible):**
* **Remote Code Execution (CRITICAL):** RFI directly leads to RCE, as attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by providing malicious URLs.
* **Complete System Compromise (CRITICAL):** RCE often allows attackers to gain full control of the compromised server.

#####         * **Impact Summary (for Path Traversal, LFI, RFI in this context):**

The impact of successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities through route parameter manipulation ranges from **Medium to High**, primarily focusing on **Information Disclosure** and the potential for **Remote Code Execution** in specific scenarios (especially with LFI and theoretically RFI, though RFI is less likely in a standard Hanami setup).  Information disclosure alone can be highly damaging, leading to further attacks and compromise.

### 5. Hanami Specific Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risks of Route Parameter Manipulation leading to Path Traversal, LFI, and RFI in Hanami applications, implement the following strategies:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strict Parameter Validation:**  Validate all route parameters rigorously. Define expected formats, character sets, and lengths. Use Hanami's parameter validation features within actions to enforce these rules.
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** If parameters are expected to represent filenames or paths, whitelist only allowed characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores) and reject any special characters like `../`, `./`, `:`, etc.
    * **Sanitize Input:**  Even with validation, sanitize input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters. For path-related parameters, consider using functions that normalize paths and remove directory traversal sequences.

2. **Avoid Direct File Path Manipulation in Routes:**
    * **Abstraction Layer:**  Do not directly use user-supplied route parameters to construct file paths for direct file system access. Instead, use an abstraction layer. For example, use a database or a predefined mapping to associate user-provided identifiers with actual file paths.
    * **Indirect File Access:** If file access is necessary, use secure file handling methods.  Instead of directly constructing paths from user input, use indexes, IDs, or predefined keys to retrieve file paths from a secure configuration or database.

3. **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * **Restrict Access to Public Directories:** Ensure that only truly public files are placed in the `public/` directory. Sensitive files should be stored outside the web server's document root.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Hanami application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the impact if a vulnerability is exploited.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on routing configurations and file handling logic.

4. **Hanami Framework Features:**
    * **Hanami::Action Parameter Validation:** Leverage Hanami's built-in parameter validation within actions to enforce data type and format constraints on route parameters.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow general secure coding practices for Ruby and Hanami development.

**Example of Mitigation (Secure Code - Recommended Approach):**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (SECURE EXAMPLE)
get '/files/:filename', to: 'files#show'

# app/controllers/files/show.rb (SECURE EXAMPLE)
module Web
  module Controllers
    module Files
      class Show
        include Web::Action
        params do
          required(:filename).filled(:str, format: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/) # Whitelist allowed characters
        end

        def call(params)
          filename = params[:filename]
          safe_filename = sanitize_filename(filename) # Further sanitization (optional but good practice)
          full_path = File.join('./public/uploads', safe_filename) # Construct path with sanitized filename

          if File.exist?(full_path)
            send_file(full_path)
          else
            halt 404, 'File not found'
          end
        rescue Hanami::Action::InvalidParamsError => e
          halt 400, 'Invalid filename parameter' # Handle invalid input
        end

        private

        def sanitize_filename(filename)
          # Example sanitization - more robust sanitization might be needed
          filename.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]/, '') # Remove any characters not in whitelist
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Explanation of Mitigation Example:**

* **Parameter Validation:**  The `params do ... end` block in the action enforces that the `filename` parameter is required, filled, a string, and matches a regular expression that only allows alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. This prevents path traversal characters like `../`.
* **Filename Sanitization:** The `sanitize_filename` method (optional but recommended) further cleans the filename by removing any characters that are not explicitly whitelisted.
* **Error Handling:**  The `rescue Hanami::Action::InvalidParamsError` block handles cases where the parameter validation fails, returning a 400 Bad Request error.

### 6. Risk Justification

This attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK** and the node as **CRITICAL** for the following reasons:

* **Ease of Exploitation:** Path Traversal and LFI vulnerabilities are often relatively easy to exploit, requiring minimal technical skill. Attackers can often use readily available tools or manual manipulation of URLs.
* **Common Occurrence:** Routing misconfigurations and insufficient input validation are common vulnerabilities in web applications, making this attack path highly relevant.
* **Significant Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to significant information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data, application source code, and even system credentials. In LFI scenarios, RCE is a serious possibility, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Fundamental Application Component:** Routing is a core component of any web application. Vulnerabilities in routing configurations can affect a wide range of functionalities and expose critical parts of the application.

**Conclusion:**

Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation, particularly through Route Parameter Manipulation leading to Path Traversal and LFI, represents a significant security risk for Hanami applications. By understanding these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly strengthen the security posture of their application and protect against these common and potentially damaging attacks.  Prioritizing secure routing practices and robust input validation is crucial for building secure Hanami applications.
