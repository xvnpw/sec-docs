### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 8. Insecure Authentication and Authorization Implementation (Hanami Security) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This root node signifies a fundamental security flaw: **the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms are not implemented securely.** This is a critical issue because these mechanisms are the gatekeepers to application resources and data. Weaknesses here can lead to widespread compromise.

**Risk Level:** HIGH-RISK
**Criticality:** CRITICAL

#### * Attack Vectors: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This node represents the general approach an attacker would take: **targeting and exploiting any weaknesses present in the application's authentication and authorization logic.** This is a broad attack vector encompassing various specific vulnerabilities.

**Risk Level:** HIGH-RISK

##### * Broken Authentication Mechanisms (e.g., weak password policies, session fixation, insecure token handling - less Hanami specific but common) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This sub-node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from **flawed implementation of authentication processes.**  While some examples are noted as "less Hanami specific," they are still highly relevant to any web application, including those built with Hanami.

**Risk Level:** HIGH-RISK

###### **- Broken Authentication Mechanisms: Weak Password Policies**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Weak Password Policies**. Developers fail to enforce strong password policies, allowing users to choose easily guessable passwords. This makes brute-force and dictionary attacks significantly more effective.
*   **Hanami Context:** Hanami itself doesn't enforce password policies. This is the responsibility of the developer when implementing user registration and password management. If developers don't implement checks for password complexity, minimum length, and prevent common passwords, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example (Conceptual Hanami Code - Registration Action):**

    ```ruby
    # app/actions/users/create.rb
    module Web::Actions::Users
      class Create < Web::Action
        params do
          required(:email).filled(:str)
          required(:password).filled(:str) # No password strength validation here!
        end

        def handle(params, **)
          if params.valid?
            # ... create user with params[:password] ...
          else
            # ... handle errors ...
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    In this example, the code accepts any string as a password without validation.

*   **Vulnerabilities:** Broken Authentication, Account Takeover.
*   **Impact:** HIGH - Successful exploitation leads to easy account compromise, potentially affecting a large number of users.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong password complexity requirements:** Enforce minimum password length, require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Libraries like `bcrypt` (commonly used for password hashing in Ruby) can be combined with validation logic in Hanami actions or repositories to enforce these policies.
    *   **Password Strength Meters:** Integrate password strength meters in the user interface to guide users towards choosing stronger passwords.
    *   **Regular Password Audits (Internal):** Periodically audit user passwords (if stored in a reversible format - which is strongly discouraged) or use password cracking tools against password hashes in a controlled environment to identify weak passwords.
    *   **Educate Users:**  Provide clear guidelines and tips to users on creating strong passwords.

###### **- Broken Authentication Mechanisms: Session Fixation**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Session Fixation**. An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they authenticate.
*   **Hanami Context:** Hanami applications, by default, use Rack sessions. If session management is not handled carefully, session fixation vulnerabilities can arise.  This is less about Hanami-specific code and more about general web application security principles.
*   **Example (Conceptual Attack Scenario):**
    1.  Attacker obtains a valid session ID (e.g., by visiting the application and getting a cookie).
    2.  Attacker crafts a malicious link or uses other methods to force a victim user to use this specific session ID when logging in.
    3.  User logs in successfully using the attacker-controlled session ID.
    4.  Attacker, knowing the session ID, can now access the application as the authenticated user.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Session Hijacking, Account Takeover.
*   **Impact:** HIGH - Allows attackers to directly hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regenerate Session ID on Login:**  Crucially, **always regenerate the session ID after successful authentication.** This ensures that even if an attacker has a session ID before login, it becomes invalid after the user authenticates. Hanami applications using Rack sessions can achieve this by calling `session.regenerate` within the authentication action.
    *   **Use Secure Session Cookies:** Ensure session cookies are set with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. `HttpOnly` prevents client-side JavaScript access, and `Secure` ensures cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS. Hanami's Rack session configuration should be reviewed to ensure these flags are enabled.
    *   **Implement Session Timeout:**  Set reasonable session timeouts to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.

###### **- Broken Authentication Mechanisms: Insecure Token Handling**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Insecure Token Handling**. If the application uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, API keys), vulnerabilities can arise from insecure storage, transmission, or validation of these tokens. This includes:
    *   **Storing tokens insecurely:**  Storing tokens in local storage, cookies without `HttpOnly` flag, or in easily accessible locations.
    *   **Transmitting tokens over insecure channels (HTTP):**  Exposing tokens to interception during transmission.
    *   **Weak token generation or validation:** Using weak algorithms for signing tokens or not properly validating token signatures.
*   **Hanami Context:** If a Hanami application implements API endpoints or uses token-based authentication for any part of its functionality (e.g., single-page applications, mobile apps), insecure token handling can be a significant risk.
*   **Example (Conceptual Hanami API Action - Insecure Token Storage):**

    ```ruby
    # app/actions/api/auth/login.rb
    module Web::Actions::Api::Auth
      class Login < Web::Action
        # ... authentication logic ...
        def handle(*, response)
          # ... generate token ...
          token = generate_jwt_token(user)
          response.headers['Authorization'] = "Bearer #{token}" # Send token in header
          # Insecurely storing token in local storage (client-side JS would do this)
          # localStorage.setItem('authToken', token); // Vulnerable!
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    Storing the token in `localStorage` makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

*   **Vulnerabilities:** Broken Authentication, Account Takeover, Session Hijacking (in token-based systems).
*   **Impact:** HIGH - Compromised tokens can grant attackers persistent unauthorized access.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Token Storage:**  Store tokens securely. For web applications, using `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies for session tokens is generally recommended. For API tokens, consider using short-lived tokens and refresh tokens, and store refresh tokens securely (e.g., in server-side session storage or encrypted database). Avoid storing sensitive tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` in browsers due to XSS risks.
    *   **HTTPS Only:**  Always transmit tokens over HTTPS to prevent interception.
    *   **Strong Token Generation and Validation:** Use strong cryptographic algorithms for token signing (e.g., HMAC-SHA256 for JWT). Properly validate token signatures and expiration times on the server-side. Use established libraries for token generation and validation to avoid implementing cryptography from scratch.
    *   **Token Rotation and Expiration:** Implement token rotation and short expiration times to limit the lifespan of compromised tokens.

##### * Authorization Bypass (e.g., improper role checks, missing authorization checks in actions or slices) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This sub-node focuses on vulnerabilities related to **flawed or missing authorization logic.**  Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within the application.

**Risk Level:** HIGH-RISK (can be MEDIUM to HIGH depending on the sensitivity of the bypassed functionality)

###### **- Authorization Bypass: Improper Role Checks**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Improper Role Checks**.  Authorization logic incorrectly checks user roles or permissions, leading to unintended access. This can occur due to:
    *   **Logic errors in role comparison:**  Using incorrect operators (e.g., `OR` instead of `AND`, `>` instead of `>=`) or flawed conditional statements.
    *   **Incorrect role assignment:**  Assigning users to the wrong roles in the database or user management system.
    *   **Hardcoded roles or permissions:**  Embedding role checks directly in code without a flexible and maintainable authorization system.
*   **Hanami Context:** In Hanami, authorization checks are typically implemented within actions or slices before performing sensitive operations. Improper role checks in these locations can lead to authorization bypass.
*   **Example (Conceptual Hanami Action - Improper Role Check):**

    ```ruby
    # app/actions/admin/dashboard/index.rb
    module Web::Actions::Admin::Dashboard
      class Index < Web::Action
        before :authenticate! # Assume this authenticates the user

        def handle(*, response)
          user = current_user # Assume current_user is available after authentication

          # Improper role check - using OR instead of AND (example error)
          unless user.role == 'admin' || user.role == 'editor' # Intended to be AND for admin access only
            response.status = 403
            response.body = 'Unauthorized'
            return
          end

          # ... render admin dashboard ...
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    In this flawed example, the intention might have been to allow only 'admin' users, but using `OR` incorrectly allows both 'admin' and 'editor' roles to access the admin dashboard.

*   **Vulnerabilities:** Authorization Bypass, Privilege Escalation (if lower-privileged users gain access to higher-privileged functionalities).
*   **Impact:** MEDIUM to HIGH - Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities. Privilege escalation can lead to significant damage.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly Review Authorization Logic:**  Carefully review and test all authorization checks in actions and slices. Pay close attention to conditional statements and role comparisons.
    *   **Use a Robust Authorization Library/Pattern:** Consider using an authorization library or implementing a well-defined authorization pattern (e.g., Role-Based Access Control - RBAC, Attribute-Based Access Control - ABAC) to structure and manage permissions effectively. Libraries like `pundit` or `cancancan` (though more common in Rails, concepts are transferable) can help organize authorization logic.
    *   **Centralized Authorization Logic:**  Avoid scattering authorization checks throughout the codebase. Centralize authorization logic in dedicated modules or services to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests for Authorization:**  Write comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically for authorization logic to ensure that permissions are enforced correctly for different user roles and scenarios.

###### **- Authorization Bypass: Missing Authorization Checks in Actions or Slices**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Missing Authorization Checks**. Developers fail to implement authorization checks in actions or slices that handle sensitive data or functionalities. This means that even if authentication is in place, any authenticated user might be able to access resources or perform actions they should not be allowed to.
*   **Hanami Context:**  This is a common oversight. Developers might focus on authentication but forget to implement proper authorization checks in every action or slice that requires them.
*   **Example (Conceptual Hanami Action - Missing Authorization Check):**

    ```ruby
    # app/actions/admin/users/delete.rb
    module Web::Actions::Admin::Users
      class Delete < Web::Action
        before :authenticate! # User is authenticated, but no authorization check!

        params do
          required(:id).filled(:int)
        end

        def handle(params, **)
          if params.valid?
            user_id_to_delete = params[:id]
            # ... delete user with ID user_id_to_delete ... # Sensitive operation!
            response.body = "User #{user_id_to_delete} deleted."
          else
            # ... handle errors ...
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    In this example, while the `authenticate!` before-action ensures the user is logged in, there's no check to verify if the logged-in user is actually authorized to delete users (e.g., if they are an admin). Any authenticated user could potentially delete users.

*   **Vulnerabilities:** Authorization Bypass, Privilege Escalation.
*   **Impact:** MEDIUM to HIGH - Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or execution of privileged operations.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Default Deny Approach:**  Adopt a "default deny" approach to authorization.  Assume that access is denied unless explicitly granted.
    *   **Code Reviews Focused on Authorization:**  Conduct code reviews specifically focused on identifying missing authorization checks in actions and slices, especially those handling sensitive operations (data modification, deletion, access to sensitive information).
    *   **Security Checklists:**  Use security checklists during development to ensure that authorization checks are considered for every relevant action and slice.
    *   **Automated Security Scans:**  Utilize static analysis security scanning tools that can help identify potential missing authorization checks (though these tools may not catch all cases, they can be a valuable layer of defense).

### 5. Conclusion and Best Practices

The attack path **"Insecure Authentication and Authorization Implementation"** represents a critical security risk for Hanami applications.  Weaknesses in these fundamental security mechanisms can have severe consequences, ranging from unauthorized data access to complete account takeover and privilege escalation.
