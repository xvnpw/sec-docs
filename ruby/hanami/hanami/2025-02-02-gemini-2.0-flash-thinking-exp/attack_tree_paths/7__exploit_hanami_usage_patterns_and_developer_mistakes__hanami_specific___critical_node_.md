### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. Insecure Action Logic (Hanami Actions) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

Hanami Actions are the core components responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. They reside within the `actions/` directory of a Hanami application and are analogous to controllers in other MVC frameworks.  Actions are Ruby classes that inherit from `Hanami::Action` and are responsible for:

* **Receiving and processing user input (parameters).**
* **Interacting with the application's domain logic (repositories, entities, services).**
* **Preparing and rendering responses (views, serializers).**

Due to their central role in handling user requests and data, actions are a prime target for attackers.  Developer mistakes in action logic, particularly related to input handling and authorization, can introduce significant vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Exploit Action Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This node highlights the exploitation of inherent flaws within the action logic itself.  This is not about framework vulnerabilities, but rather vulnerabilities introduced by developers during the implementation of action logic.  The following sub-paths detail the most critical flaws:

##### 4.2.1. Inadequate Input Validation in Actions (leading to injection attacks, data corruption, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Description:**

This vulnerability arises when developers fail to properly validate and sanitize user inputs received by Hanami Actions.  Hanami provides mechanisms for parameter handling, but it is the developer's responsibility to implement robust validation logic *within* the action to ensure that the data received is safe and conforms to expected formats and constraints.

**Attack Vector Explanation:**

Attackers can manipulate user inputs (e.g., query parameters, request body, headers) to inject malicious code or data into the application.  Without proper validation, this malicious input can be processed by the application, leading to various injection vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities:**

* **SQL Injection:** If user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization (e.g., using parameterized queries or an ORM like Hanami::Model with its built-in protection), attackers can inject malicious SQL code to:
    * **Bypass authentication and authorization.**
    * **Extract sensitive data from the database.**
    * **Modify or delete data.**
    * **Potentially gain control over the database server.**

    **Example (Conceptual - Vulnerable Code):**

    ```ruby
    # actions/books/index.rb
    module Actions::Books
      class Index < Hanami::Action
        def handle(req, res)
          query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%#{req.params[:search]}%'" # VULNERABLE!
          books = BookRepository.raw(query) # Assuming raw SQL execution
          res.body = books.to_json
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like `/?search=%27%20OR%201=1--` to potentially bypass the intended search logic and retrieve all books.

* **Command Injection:** If user input is used to construct system commands executed by the application (e.g., using `Kernel.system`, `exec`, backticks), attackers can inject malicious commands to:
    * **Execute arbitrary code on the server.**
    * **Read or write files.**
    * **Compromise the server.**

    **Example (Conceptual - Vulnerable Code):**

    ```ruby
    # actions/reports/generate.rb
    module Actions::Reports
      class Generate < Hanami::Action
        def handle(req, res)
          filename = req.params[:filename] # Potentially unsafe filename
          command = "generate_report.sh #{filename}" # VULNERABLE!
          system(command)
          res.body = "Report generated."
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like `/?filename=report.txt; rm -rf /` to potentially execute a dangerous command on the server.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If user input is displayed on web pages without proper encoding, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to:
    * **Session hijacking.**
    * **Defacement of the website.**
    * **Redirection to malicious sites.**
    * **Stealing user credentials.**

    **Example (Conceptual - Vulnerable Code):**

    ```ruby
    # actions/posts/show.rb
    module Actions::Posts
      class Show < Hanami::Action
        def handle(req, res)
          post = PostRepository.find(req.params[:id])
          res.body = "<h1>#{post.title}</h1><p>#{post.content}</p>" # VULNERABLE if post.title or post.content contains unescaped HTML
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    If `post.title` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will be executed in the user's browser.

* **Path Traversal:** If user input is used to construct file paths without proper validation, attackers can manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to:
    * **Reading sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, source code).**
    * **Writing or modifying files in unauthorized locations.**

    **Example (Conceptual - Vulnerable Code):**

    ```ruby
    # actions/files/download.rb
    module Actions::Files
      class Download < Hanami::Action
        def handle(req, res)
          filepath = "uploads/#{req.params[:file]}" # VULNERABLE!
          res.send_file(filepath)
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like `/?file=../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to download the `/etc/passwd` file.

* **Other Injection Vulnerabilities:**  This category encompasses other types of injection attacks that can arise from inadequate input validation, such as:
    * **LDAP Injection**
    * **XML Injection**
    * **Template Injection**
    * **Email Header Injection**

**Impact:**

The impact of inadequate input validation can range from **Medium to Critical**, depending on the type of injection and the sensitivity of the affected data and systems.  Successful exploitation can lead to:

* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive user data, application data, or internal system information.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain full control.
* **Data Corruption:** Modification or deletion of critical application data, leading to service disruption or data integrity issues.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause application crashes or resource exhaustion.

**Hanami Specific Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strong Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation within Hanami Actions. Use techniques like:
    * **Type checking:** Ensure parameters are of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, email).
    * **Format validation:** Validate parameters against specific formats (e.g., regular expressions for email, phone numbers).
    * **Whitelist validation:** Only allow known and safe values for parameters.
    * **Range validation:** Ensure numerical parameters are within acceptable ranges.
    * **Length validation:** Limit the length of string parameters.
* **Parameter Mapping and Type Coercion:** Hanami's parameter handling provides type coercion. Leverage this to ensure parameters are treated as the expected types.
* **Parameterized Queries/ORM:**  When interacting with databases, **always** use parameterized queries or Hanami::Model's ORM, which automatically handles escaping and prevents SQL injection. Avoid raw SQL queries with string interpolation of user input.
* **Output Encoding:** When displaying user-generated content on web pages, **always** encode output appropriately to prevent XSS. Use Hanami's view helpers or templating engine features to escape HTML entities.
* **Secure File Handling:** When dealing with file paths based on user input, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal. Use whitelisting of allowed file names or paths and avoid directly concatenating user input into file paths.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address input validation vulnerabilities proactively.

##### 4.2.2. Authorization Bypass in Actions (allowing unauthorized access to functionality) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Description:**

Authorization bypass vulnerabilities occur when developers fail to implement proper authorization checks within Hanami Actions. This means that the application does not correctly verify if the user making a request has the necessary permissions to access the requested functionality or data.

**Attack Vector Explanation:**

Attackers can exploit missing or flawed authorization checks to gain access to functionalities or data that they should not be able to access. This can involve:

* **Directly accessing actions:**  Bypassing intended access controls by directly sending requests to actions without proper authentication or authorization.
* **Manipulating request parameters:**  Modifying request parameters to trick the application into granting unauthorized access.
* **Exploiting logical flaws in authorization logic:**  Finding weaknesses in the implemented authorization logic that allow for bypass.

**Vulnerabilities:**

* **Authorization Bypass:**  Attackers can successfully access functionalities or data without proper authorization. This can manifest in various forms:
    * **Missing Authorization Checks:** Actions that should be protected are accessible to anyone without any authentication or authorization.
    * **Flawed Authorization Logic:**  Authorization checks are present but are implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to circumvent them.
    * **Inconsistent Authorization:** Authorization is applied inconsistently across different parts of the application, leaving some actions unprotected.

* **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, authorization bypass can lead to privilege escalation, where an attacker with low-level privileges can gain access to functionalities or data intended for users with higher privileges (e.g., administrators).

**Impact:**

The impact of authorization bypass vulnerabilities is typically **Medium to High**.  Successful exploitation can lead to:

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can access confidential user data, business data, or internal system information.
* **Unauthorized Modification of Data:** Attackers can modify or delete data that they should not have access to, potentially leading to data corruption or service disruption.
* **Unauthorized Functionality Execution:** Attackers can execute administrative functions or other restricted functionalities, potentially compromising the application or underlying systems.
* **Account Takeover:** In severe cases, authorization bypass can be combined with other vulnerabilities to facilitate account takeover.

**Hanami Specific Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Authorization Logic in Actions:**  Explicitly implement authorization checks within Hanami Actions to verify user permissions before granting access to functionalities or data.
* **Authentication Middleware:** Use Hanami middleware to handle authentication and establish user identity before requests reach actions. This ensures that actions can rely on a properly authenticated user context.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Implement RBAC or ABAC mechanisms to manage user permissions and define access policies. Libraries like `rolify` or custom solutions can be integrated with Hanami.
* **Authorization Libraries/Gems:** Consider using authorization gems or libraries specifically designed for Ruby and Hanami to simplify and standardize authorization logic (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan).
* **Consistent Authorization Strategy:**  Develop and enforce a consistent authorization strategy across the entire application. Ensure that all actions that require authorization are properly protected.
* **Thorough Testing of Authorization Logic:**  Thoroughly test authorization logic to ensure that it functions as intended and that there are no bypass vulnerabilities. Include unit tests and integration tests that specifically cover authorization scenarios.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address authorization bypass vulnerabilities proactively.

### 5. Summary and Recommendations

The "Insecure Action Logic" path within the attack tree highlights critical vulnerabilities stemming from developer mistakes in handling user input and implementing authorization within Hanami Actions.  **Inadequate Input Validation** and **Authorization Bypass** are high-risk paths that can lead to severe security consequences, including data breaches, remote code execution, and unauthorized access.

**Recommendations for Hanami Developers:**
