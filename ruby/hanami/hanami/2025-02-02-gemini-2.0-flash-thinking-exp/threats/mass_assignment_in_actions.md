### 4. Deep Analysis of Mass Assignment in Actions

#### 4.1. Understanding Mass Assignment

Mass assignment is a vulnerability that arises when an application automatically binds user-provided input (typically from HTTP request parameters) directly to internal data structures, such as database model attributes, without proper filtering or validation.  In essence, it allows an attacker to potentially modify any attribute of a model by simply including the attribute name and desired value in the request parameters.

This becomes a security risk when models contain attributes that should **not** be directly modifiable by users, such as:

*   **Administrative flags:** `is_admin`, `role`.
*   **Internal state indicators:** `is_verified`, `status`.
*   **Audit fields:** `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`.
*   **Sensitive data fields:**  Potentially fields that should only be modified through specific business logic.

#### 4.2. Mass Assignment in Hanami Context

In Hanami applications, the risk of mass assignment is present within the interaction of Actions, Parameters, Entities, and Repositories:

*   **Actions:** Hanami Actions are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. They receive user input through the `params` object.
*   **Parameters:** Hanami's `params` object provides a structured and validated way to access request parameters. However, if actions directly use these parameters to update Entities without filtering, they become vulnerable.
*   **Entities:** Hanami Entities represent data objects and are often mapped to database tables. They contain attributes that represent the data fields.
*   **Repositories:** Hanami Repositories are responsible for data persistence and retrieval. They often interact with Entities to update or create records in the database.

**Vulnerable Scenario:**

Consider a simplified Hanami application with a `User` entity and a `Users::Update` action.

**Entity (`lib/my_app/entities/user.rb`):**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Entities
    class User < Hanami::Entity
      attributes :id, :name, :email, :password_digest, :is_admin, :created_at, :updated_at
    end
  end
end
```

**Repository (`lib/my_app/repositories/user_repository.rb`):**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Repositories
    class UserRepository < Hanami::Repository
    end
  end
end
```

**Vulnerable Action (`app/actions/users/update.rb`):**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Actions
    module Users
      class Update < Actions::Base
        include Deps[repo: 'repositories.user']

        def handle(req, res)
          user_id = req.params[:id]
          user_data = req.params.to_h # Potentially dangerous!

          user = repo.find(user_id)
          if user
            updated_user = user.merge(user_data) # Mass assignment vulnerability!
            repo.update(user.id, updated_user)
            res.status = 200
            res.body = { message: "User updated successfully" }.to_json
          else
            res.status = 404
            res.body = { error: "User not found" }.to_json
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker identifies the vulnerability:** The attacker analyzes the application and notices that the `Users::Update` action directly merges request parameters into the `User` entity without filtering.
2.  **Crafting a malicious request:** The attacker crafts a `PATCH` request to `/users/{user_id}` with the following parameters:

    ```
    PATCH /users/1 HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "name": "Victim User",
      "email": "victim@example.com",
      "is_admin": true  <-- Malicious parameter!
    }
    ```

3.  **Exploitation:** The vulnerable `Update` action receives this request. The `req.params.to_h` converts the request parameters into a hash. This hash, including the malicious `"is_admin": true` parameter, is then merged into the existing `User` entity using `user.merge(user_data)`.
4.  **Impact:** The `repo.update` method persists the modified `User` entity to the database.  The attacker has successfully elevated their privileges by setting `is_admin` to `true`, even though they were not authorized to do so.

#### 4.3. Impact of Mass Assignment

Successful mass assignment attacks can have significant security and business impacts:

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify sensitive data fields, leading to data corruption, inaccurate information, and potential financial or reputational damage. In our example, user details are manipulated.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying attributes like `is_admin` or `role`, attackers can gain unauthorized administrative privileges, allowing them to access restricted functionalities, data, and potentially compromise the entire system.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can alter data in ways not intended by the application logic, potentially bypassing business rules and constraints. For example, changing order statuses, pricing, or inventory levels.
*   **Business Logic Bypass:** Mass assignment can be used to circumvent intended workflows or business processes. For instance, an attacker might be able to directly set a payment status to "paid" without going through the actual payment gateway.

#### 4.4. Hanami Components Affected in Detail

*   **Actions:** Actions are the entry points for user requests and are responsible for processing input. Vulnerable actions directly process and use unfiltered `params` to update entities.
*   **Parameters:** While Hanami's `params` object provides validation capabilities, it doesn't inherently prevent mass assignment if actions are not configured to explicitly filter and permit parameters.
*   **Entities:** Entities are the data models that are vulnerable to mass assignment if actions directly update them with unfiltered user input. Entities themselves don't inherently prevent mass assignment; the protection must be implemented in the actions or repositories.
*   **Repositories:** Repositories are responsible for persisting data. If actions pass them entities that have been modified through mass assignment, the repositories will persist the compromised data to the database.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

To effectively mitigate mass assignment vulnerabilities in Hanami applications, implement the following strategies:

#### 5.1. Strong Parameter Filtering and Whitelisting in Actions

**Core Principle:**  Explicitly define and permit only the parameters that are intended to be updated by users for each action. Discard any other parameters present in the request.

**Hanami Implementation using `params` API:**

Instead of directly using `req.params.to_h` or similar, leverage Hanami's `params` API to define allowed parameters.

**Example (Secure `Users::Update` Action):**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Actions
    module Users
      class Update < Actions::Base
        include Deps[repo: 'repositories.user']

        params do
          required(:id).filled(:integer) # Ensure ID is present and valid
          optional(:name).filled(:string)
          optional(:email).filled(:email)
          # is_admin parameter is intentionally NOT permitted!
        end

        def handle(req, res)
          if req.params.valid?
            user_id = req.params[:id]
            permitted_user_data = req.params.to_h.slice(:name, :email) # Whitelist parameters

            user = repo.find(user_id)
            if user
              updated_user = user.merge(permitted_user_data)
              repo.update(user.id, updated_user)
              res.status = 200
              res.body = { message: "User updated successfully" }.to_json
            else
              res.status = 404
              res.body = { error: "User not found" }.to_json
            end
          else
            res.status = 422 # Unprocessable Entity for validation errors
            res.body = { errors: req.params.errors.to_h }.to_json
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`params do ... end` block:** Defines the expected parameters for the action.
*   **`required(:id).filled(:integer)`:**  Ensures the `id` parameter is present and is an integer.
*   **`optional(:name).filled(:string)` and `optional(:email).filled(:email)`:**  Allows `name` and `email` parameters, validating them as string and email respectively.
*   **`is_admin` is intentionally omitted:** This prevents attackers from sending the `is_admin` parameter and having it processed.
*   **`req.params.to_h.slice(:name, :email)`:**  Explicitly whitelists and extracts only the permitted parameters (`name`, `email`) from the validated parameters hash.  This ensures that even if other parameters are present in the request, they are ignored.
*   **`req.params.valid?` and `req.params.errors`:**  Handles parameter validation and returns appropriate error responses if validation fails.

#### 5.2. Define Specific Permitted Parameters for Each Action

**Best Practice:**  Each action should have its own `params` block that precisely defines the parameters it expects and allows. Avoid reusing parameter definitions across actions unless they truly share the exact same input requirements. This principle of least privilege helps minimize the attack surface.

**Example:**

*   `Users::Create` action might permit `name`, `email`, and `password`.
*   `Users::Update` action (as shown above) might permit `name` and `email`.
*   `Users::ChangePassword` action might permit `current_password` and `new_password`.

Each action has a specific purpose and should only accept the parameters necessary for that purpose.

#### 5.3. Avoid Directly Assigning Request Parameters to Model Attributes Without Validation and Filtering

**Anti-Pattern:** Directly merging or assigning `req.params` to entities without filtering is a major vulnerability.

**Correct Approach:** Always filter and whitelist parameters *before* merging them into entities or using them to update records.

**Example (Incorrect - Avoid This):**

```ruby
# ... (Vulnerable code - DO NOT USE) ...
updated_user = user.merge(req.params.to_h) # Direct merge of unfiltered params - BAD!
# ...
```

**Example (Correct - Use This):**

```ruby
# ... (Secure code - USE THIS) ...
permitted_user_data = req.params.to_h.slice(:name, :email) # Whitelist parameters
updated_user = user.merge(permitted_user_data) # Merge only permitted params - GOOD!
# ...
```

#### 5.4. Utilize Hanami's Parameter Validation Features

**Benefit:** Hanami's `params` API provides built-in validation rules (e.g., `required`, `optional`, `filled`, `string`, `integer`, `email`, custom validators). Use these features to enforce data integrity and type constraints. Validation helps ensure that even permitted parameters conform to expected formats and rules, further reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or exploitation.

**Example (Validation Rules):**

```ruby
params do
  required(:name).filled(:string)
  required(:email).filled(:email)
  optional(:age).maybe(:integer, gt: 0) # Optional, integer, greater than 0
end
```

**Benefits of Validation:**

*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures data conforms to expected types and formats.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides structured error messages for invalid input, improving user experience and debugging.
*   **Security:**  Reduces the likelihood of unexpected input causing application errors or vulnerabilities.

#### 5.5. Consider Using Form Objects or Input Objects

For more complex actions or when dealing with nested parameters, consider using Form Objects or Input Objects to encapsulate parameter handling, validation, and data transformation logic. This can improve code organization and maintainability while enforcing security best practices.

**Example (Conceptual Form Object):**

```ruby
# lib/my_app/forms/user_update_form.rb
module MyApp
  module Forms
    class UserUpdateForm < Hanami::Action::Params
      params do
        required(:id).filled(:integer)
        optional(:name).filled(:string)
        optional(:email).filled(:email)
      end
    end
  end
end

# app/actions/users/update.rb
module MyApp
  module Actions
    module Users
      class Update < Actions::Base
        include Deps[repo: 'repositories.user']

        def handle(req, res)
          form = Forms::UserUpdateForm.new(req.params)

          if form.valid?
            user_id = form[:id]
            permitted_user_data = form.to_h.slice(:name, :email) # Still whitelist!

            # ... rest of the action logic ...
          else
            res.status = 422
            res.body = { errors: form.errors.to_h }.to_json
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### 6. Conclusion

Mass assignment in actions is a serious threat that can lead to significant security vulnerabilities in Hanami applications. By directly assigning unfiltered request parameters to entities, developers inadvertently expose sensitive attributes to unauthorized modification.

To effectively mitigate this threat, it is crucial to adopt a **defense-in-depth approach** focused on **strong parameter filtering and whitelisting** within Hanami Actions.  Leveraging Hanami's `params` API to define permitted parameters, validate input, and explicitly whitelist allowed attributes before updating entities is paramount.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and adhering to secure coding practices, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of mass assignment vulnerabilities and build more secure and robust Hanami applications. Regular security reviews and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
