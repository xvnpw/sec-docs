### 4. Deep Analysis of Insecure Route Definitions

#### 4.1 Threat Elaboration

The "Insecure Route Definitions" threat arises when the routing configuration of a Hanami application is not designed with security in mind. This can manifest in several ways:

*   **Overly Permissive Routes:** Defining routes that are too broad or use overly generic patterns (e.g., wildcards) can unintentionally expose more endpoints than intended. This can lead to attackers accessing functionalities or resources that should be restricted.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:**  Routes that handle sensitive operations or access protected resources must be protected by authorization checks. If routes are defined without proper authorization middleware or interceptors, attackers can bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Exposure of Administrative Endpoints:**  Administrative or privileged functionalities should be strictly controlled and accessible only to authorized users. Insecure route definitions can inadvertently expose these endpoints to unauthorized users, potentially leading to privilege escalation and system compromise.
*   **Predictable or Guessable Routes:**  While not always directly related to the *definition* itself, predictable route structures can make it easier for attackers to discover and target sensitive endpoints. This is exacerbated when combined with other insecure route practices.
*   **Default Routes and Configurations:**  Relying on default route configurations without careful review and customization can sometimes lead to unintended exposure of functionalities.

#### 4.2 Hanami Context and Examples

Hanami's routing DSL is powerful and flexible, but this flexibility can also be a source of vulnerabilities if not used carefully. Let's examine how insecure route definitions can occur in Hanami:

**Example 1: Overly Broad Wildcard Route**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show'
get '/users/*', to: 'users#catch_all' # Insecure - catches too much!
```

In this example, the route `/users/*` is overly broad. While it might be intended to handle sub-paths under `/users`, it could unintentionally catch requests to administrative endpoints if they are mistakenly placed under the `/users` path or if the `catch_all` action is not properly secured.

**Example 2: Missing Authorization for Admin Route**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
get '/admin/dashboard', to: 'admin#dashboard' # Potentially insecure - missing authorization
```

This route for an admin dashboard is defined without any explicit authorization. If there's no middleware or interceptor to check if the user is an administrator before accessing this route, any authenticated user (or even unauthenticated users if authentication is not enforced) could potentially access the admin dashboard.

**Example 3:  Unconstrained Route Parameters**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
get '/documents/:id', to: 'documents#show' # Insecure if 'id' is not validated and authorized
```

While seemingly standard, this route becomes insecure if the `documents#show` action does not properly validate and authorize access based on the `:id` parameter.  For instance, if the application doesn't check if the current user is authorized to view the document with the given `id`, an attacker could potentially access documents they shouldn't.

**Example 4: Exposing Internal Functionality through Routes**

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
post '/debug/run_command', to: 'debug#run_command' # Highly insecure - debug endpoint in production
```

This example demonstrates a critical vulnerability. Exposing debug or internal functionalities through routes, especially in production environments, is extremely dangerous. An attacker could exploit this route to execute arbitrary commands or gain access to sensitive internal application state.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors and Scenarios

An attacker can exploit insecure route definitions through various attack vectors:

*   **URL Fuzzing and Path Traversal:** Attackers can use automated tools to fuzz URLs and probe for accessible endpoints, including those unintentionally exposed by overly broad routes. They might try path traversal techniques (e.g., `../admin/dashboard`) to bypass intended route structures.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:**  If route parameters are not properly validated and authorized, attackers can manipulate them to access resources or functionalities they shouldn't. For example, changing the `:id` in `/documents/:id` to access different documents.
*   **Endpoint Guessing:**  If route structures are predictable or based on common patterns, attackers can guess endpoint names (e.g., `/admin`, `/api/v1/users`, `/debug`) and attempt to access them.
*   **Exploiting Default Routes:**  Attackers might target default routes or configurations that are often overlooked during development and deployment, hoping to find vulnerabilities in these less scrutinized areas.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  By accessing administrative or privileged routes that are not properly secured, attackers can escalate their privileges within the application, gaining control over sensitive data and functionalities.

**Attack Scenario Example:**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker starts by exploring the application, perhaps using a web crawler or manually browsing. They might notice a predictable route structure like `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/products`, etc.
2.  **Endpoint Guessing:** Based on this pattern, they guess the existence of an administrative API endpoint, perhaps `/api/v1/admin/users`.
3.  **Access Attempt:** The attacker attempts to access `/api/v1/admin/users` without proper authentication or authorization credentials.
4.  **Vulnerability Exploitation:** If the route `/api/v1/admin/users` is defined without adequate authorization middleware in the Hanami application, the attacker might successfully access it, gaining unauthorized access to administrative user management functionalities.
5.  **Impact:** The attacker can now potentially create, modify, or delete user accounts, escalate privileges, or perform other administrative actions, leading to significant security breaches.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of insecure route definitions can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Unauthorized Access to Features:** Attackers can gain access to application features and functionalities that are intended for specific user roles or administrative purposes.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data, including user information, application configuration, or internal system details, can be exposed through improperly secured routes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Exposure of administrative routes can lead to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to gain control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Compromise:**  Attackers might be able to modify or delete data through insecure routes, compromising data integrity and application functionality.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, insecure routes could be exploited to trigger resource-intensive operations or expose vulnerabilities that can be used for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Security breaches resulting from insecure route definitions can severely damage the application's and organization's reputation, leading to loss of user trust and business impact.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, insecure route definitions could lead to violations of data privacy and security compliance requirements.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Hanami Specific)

To mitigate the "Insecure Route Definitions" threat in a Hanami application, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege in Route Definitions:**
    *   **Define Specific Routes:** Avoid overly broad wildcard routes. Define routes as specifically as possible, matching only the intended URL patterns.
    *   **Use Route Constraints:** Leverage Hanami's route constraints to further restrict route matching based on parameter types, formats, or other criteria.
    *   **Example (Improved Wildcard):** Instead of `/users/*`, if you need to handle sub-paths under users, define specific routes for each intended sub-path:

        ```ruby
        get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show'
        get '/users/:id/posts', to: 'users#posts'
        get '/users/:id/profile', to: 'users#profile'
        # Avoid catch-all unless absolutely necessary and heavily secured
        ```

*   **Restrict Route Access with Authorization:**
    *   **Implement Authorization Middleware/Interceptors:** Use Hanami middleware or interceptors to enforce authorization checks before actions are executed.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to define user roles and permissions, and use these roles in authorization checks within middleware or interceptors.
    *   **Example (Middleware for Admin Route):**

        ```ruby
        # app/middleware/admin_authorization.rb
        module Middleware
          class AdminAuthorization
            def call(env)
              # ... (Authentication logic to get current user) ...
              user = # ... get current user from session or token ...

              if user && user.admin?
                @app.call(env) # Proceed to the action
              else
                [403, {}, ['Forbidden']] # Return 403 Forbidden if not admin
              end
            end
          end
        end

        # config/routes.rb
        get '/admin/dashboard', to: 'admin#dashboard', middleware: :admin_authorization
        ```

    *   **Action-Level Authorization:**  Perform authorization checks within actions themselves for finer-grained control, especially when authorization logic is complex or context-dependent.

*   **Regular Route Definition Review:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Include route definitions in code reviews to ensure they align with security requirements and follow best practices.
    *   **Automated Route Analysis:**  Consider using static analysis tools or linters to automatically scan route definitions for potential security issues (e.g., overly broad routes, missing authorization).
    *   **Periodic Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the application, including a review of route definitions, to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

*   **Avoid Overly Broad Route Patterns:**
    *   **Be Specific with Parameters:**  Use specific parameter names and constraints instead of relying on generic wildcards whenever possible.
    *   **Avoid Catch-All Routes:**  Minimize the use of catch-all routes (`*`) unless absolutely necessary and ensure they are rigorously secured and handle only intended scenarios.
    *   **Example (Improved Parameter Specificity):** Instead of `/items/:id`, if you expect only numeric IDs, use a constraint:

        ```ruby
        get '/items/:id', to: 'items#show', constraints: { id: /\d+/ }
        ```

*   **Secure Default Routes and Configurations:**
    *   **Review Default Routes:**  Carefully review Hanami's default route configurations and ensure they are appropriate for your application's security requirements.
    *   **Customize and Harden:**  Customize default routes and configurations to minimize exposure and enforce security best practices.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable or remove any default routes or features that are not required for your application and could potentially introduce security risks.

*   **Secure Debug and Development Routes:**
    *   **Disable in Production:**  Ensure that debug routes and development-specific functionalities are completely disabled or removed in production environments.
    *   **Restrict Access in Development/Staging:**  If debug routes are necessary in development or staging environments, restrict access to authorized developers only, using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Example (Conditional Debug Route):**

        ```ruby
        # config/routes.rb
        if Hanami.env?(:development) || Hanami.env?(:staging)
          post '/debug/run_command', to: 'debug#run_command' # Only in dev/staging
        end
        ```
