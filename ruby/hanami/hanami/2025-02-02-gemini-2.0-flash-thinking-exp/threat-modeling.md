# Threat Model Analysis for hanami/hanami

## Threat: [Slice Boundary Leakage](./threats/slice_boundary_leakage.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in inter-slice communication to bypass slice boundaries. They could gain unauthorized access to data or functionalities in other slices by manipulating dependencies, exploiting shared resources, or leveraging insecure communication channels.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to functionalities in other slices, privilege escalation, potential compromise of the entire application if isolation is severely broken.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Slices, Inter-Slice Communication Mechanisms, Dependency Injection.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly define and enforce slice boundaries.
*   Implement well-defined and secure interfaces for inter-slice communication.
*   Regularly review and audit slice configurations and dependencies.
*   Utilize Hanami's dependency injection to manage dependencies explicitly.
*   Employ access control mechanisms to restrict inter-slice communication where necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Slice Communication](./threats/insecure_inter-slice_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept or manipulate communication between slices if insecure methods are used. This could involve eavesdropping on unencrypted communication, injecting malicious data into shared channels, or exploiting vulnerabilities arising from shared mutable state.

**Impact:** Data corruption, injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if data is used in database queries), unauthorized actions in other slices, potential for denial of service if communication channels are disrupted.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Slices, Inter-Slice Communication Mechanisms, potentially Actions and Repositories if data is processed insecurely after inter-slice transfer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Favor immutable data passing between slices.
*   Validate and sanitize all data exchanged between slices.
*   Use explicit and secure communication patterns (e.g., message queues with encryption, well-defined APIs with authentication).
*   Avoid relying on global or shared mutable state across slices.
*   Implement input validation and output encoding at slice boundaries.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment in Actions](./threats/mass_assignment_in_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters to modify model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible. By crafting malicious requests with unexpected parameters, they could bypass intended access controls and alter sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation (e.g., changing user roles), unauthorized data modification, potential for business logic bypass.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Actions, Parameters, Entities, Repositories.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use strong parameter filtering and whitelisting in actions.
*   Define specific permitted parameters for each action using Hanami's parameter API.
*   Avoid directly assigning request parameters to model attributes without validation and filtering.
*   Utilize Hanami's parameter validation features to enforce data integrity and type constraints.

## Threat: [Insecure Action Logic due to Framework Misunderstanding](./threats/insecure_action_logic_due_to_framework_misunderstanding.md)

**Description:** Developers unfamiliar with Hanami's action lifecycle might implement insecure logic within actions. This could include improper handling of authentication or authorization checks, incorrect session management, or vulnerabilities arising from misunderstanding the intended flow of request processing. An attacker could exploit these flaws to bypass security measures or trigger unintended behavior.

**Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization failures, insecure data handling, potential for various application-specific vulnerabilities depending on the flawed logic.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Actions, Application Controller, Authentication/Authorization mechanisms (if implemented within actions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Provide thorough training for developers on Hanami's action layer and security best practices.
*   Establish clear coding standards and guidelines for action development, emphasizing security considerations.
*   Conduct regular code reviews focusing on action logic and security implications.
*   Utilize Hanami's built-in features and recommended patterns for authentication and authorization.
*   Implement unit and integration tests to verify the security of action logic.

## Threat: [Template Injection via View Helpers or Partials](./threats/template_injection_via_view_helpers_or_partials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into templates if view helpers or partials improperly handle user-provided data. By crafting input that is not correctly escaped or sanitized, they could execute arbitrary code on the server (Server-Side Template Injection - SSTI) or inject client-side scripts (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), information disclosure, session hijacking, defacement, potentially full server compromise in case of SSTI.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Views, View Helpers, Partials, Template Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape user-provided data in views and view helpers by default.
*   Carefully review and sanitize any dynamic content used in view logic.
*   Avoid constructing view logic based on unvalidated user input.
*   Utilize Hanami's view rendering mechanisms and ensure proper escaping is enabled by default.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

## Threat: [Insecure Route Definitions](./threats/insecure_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive or poorly designed route definitions to access unintended functionalities or resources. This could involve accessing administrative endpoints, bypassing authorization checks due to broad route patterns, or exploiting routes that are not properly restricted based on user roles.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, information disclosure, potential for abuse of unintended endpoints, privilege escalation if administrative routes are exposed.

**Hanami Component Affected:** Routing, Application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define routes with the principle of least privilege, only exposing necessary endpoints.
*   Restrict route access based on necessary permissions and roles using Hanami's routing features or middleware.
*   Regularly review route definitions to ensure they align with security requirements and minimize exposure.
*   Avoid using overly broad route patterns that might unintentionally match sensitive endpoints.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies Introduced by Hanami or its Ecosystem](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_introduced_by_hanami_or_its_ecosystem.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Hanami or within the Hanami ecosystem. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can provide attack vectors that can be leveraged to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies, leading to various security breaches depending on the vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches).

**Hanami Component Affected:** Dependency Management, Gemfile, potentially all components that rely on vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update Hanami and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Stay informed about security advisories related to Hanami and its ecosystem.
*   Follow Hanami's recommendations for dependency management and security updates.
*   Implement a process for promptly patching or mitigating identified dependency vulnerabilities.
