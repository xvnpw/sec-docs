## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Hanami Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_hanami_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal and represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means full or significant control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Hanami Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_hanami_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents attacks targeting inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Hanami framework itself.
* **Attack Vectors:**

        * **Identify and Exploit Unpatched Hanami Version [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Develop/Utilize Exploit for Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in specific Hanami versions that are not patched. This often involves finding public exploits or developing custom ones.
            * **Vulnerabilities:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS).
            * **Impact:** Critical - Full application compromise, data breach, service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Routing Misconfiguration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__routing_misconfiguration_exploitation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure routing configurations within the Hanami application.

        * **Route Parameter Manipulation (e.g., path traversal if routes handle file paths directly) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers manipulate route parameters to access unauthorized resources or functionalities. Path traversal is a prime example where manipulating file paths in routes can lead to reading arbitrary files on the server.
            * **Vulnerabilities:** Path Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (less common in Hanami context but conceptually related).
            * **Impact:** Medium to High - Information disclosure, potential for RCE in specific scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. View/Template Engine Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__viewtemplate_engine_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights vulnerabilities related to the template engine used by Hanami to render views.

        * **Inject Malicious Code into Template Input (if user input is directly rendered without sanitization) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious code into user inputs that are then directly rendered by the template engine without proper sanitization. This leads to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
            * **Vulnerabilities:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
            * **Impact:** High to Critical - XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        * **Leverage Template Engine Features for Server-Side Execution (e.g., RCE via template engine specific syntax) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit inherent features of the template engine itself to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a more advanced form of SSTI.
            * **Vulnerabilities:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

Debug mode enabled in production can reveal sensitive information and weak secret keys can be easily compromised.
            * **Vulnerabilities:** Information Disclosure, Weak Security Posture, Easier Exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** Medium to High - Information disclosure, increased attack surface, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
