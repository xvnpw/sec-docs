### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Parameter Handling in Routes (Injection Vulnerabilities)

#### 4.1 Detailed Description of the Attack Surface

The attack surface of "Parameter Handling in Routes (Injection Vulnerabilities)" in Hanami applications stems from the framework's design philosophy of providing flexibility and leaving input validation largely to the developer. While this approach empowers developers with control, it also places a significant responsibility on them to implement robust security measures.

Hanami's routing system elegantly maps HTTP requests to specific actions based on defined routes. These routes often include dynamic segments denoted by placeholders (e.g., `{id}`, `{slug}`). When a request matches a route, Hanami extracts the values from these segments and makes them available as parameters within the corresponding action.

The vulnerability arises when developers directly use these extracted route parameters in sensitive operations *without proper validation or sanitization*.  These sensitive operations commonly include:

*   **Database Queries:** Constructing SQL or NoSQL queries to retrieve, update, or delete data based on route parameters.
*   **System Commands:** Executing operating system commands, potentially using route parameters as part of the command string.
*   **File System Operations:** Accessing or manipulating files based on paths constructed using route parameters.
*   **External API Calls:** Including route parameters in requests to external APIs.

If malicious users can manipulate these route parameters to inject malicious payloads, they can potentially bypass intended application logic and execute unintended actions.

#### 4.2 Hanami's Contribution to the Attack Surface

Hanami's design choices directly contribute to this attack surface in the following ways:

*   **No Automatic Input Validation at Routing Level:** Hanami does not enforce any automatic input validation or sanitization on route parameters at the framework level. This is a deliberate design decision to maintain flexibility and avoid imposing unnecessary constraints on developers.
*   **Developer Responsibility:**  The responsibility for input validation and secure parameter handling is explicitly placed on the developer within the Hanami actions. This means that if developers are unaware of the risks or fail to implement proper validation, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   **Direct Parameter Access:** Hanami provides easy access to route parameters within actions through the `params` object. This ease of access, while convenient, can also lead to developers directly using parameters without sufficient security considerations.
*   **Focus on Convention over Configuration (with Security Implications):** While Hanami emphasizes convention, security in parameter handling is not a built-in convention. Developers must actively implement security measures.

This is not to say Hanami is inherently insecure. Rather, it highlights that Hanami's design requires developers to be security-conscious and proactively implement necessary safeguards.

#### 4.3 Examples of Injection Vulnerabilities

Beyond the SQL Injection example provided, other injection types are relevant to this attack surface in Hanami applications:

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Example:** Route `/articles/{id}`. Action code:
        ```ruby
        module Web::Controllers::Articles
          class Show
            include Web::Action

            def call(params)
              article = ArticleRepository.new.find_by_id(params[:id]) # Vulnerable!
              if article
                @article = article
              else
                halt 404
              end
            end
          end
        end
        ```
        If `params[:id]` is not properly sanitized and directly used in `find_by_id` (especially if using raw SQL or an ORM that doesn't automatically parameterize), it's vulnerable to SQL injection.  A malicious request like `/articles/1 OR 1=1 --` could bypass intended filtering.

*   **Command Injection (OS Command Injection):**
    *   **Example:** Route `/download/{filename}`. Action code (highly discouraged, but illustrative):
        ```ruby
        module Web::Controllers::Downloads
          class Show
            include Web::Action

            def call(params)
              filename = params[:filename]
              command = "cat files/#{filename}" # Vulnerable!
              output = `#{command}`
              # ... handle output and send file ...
            end
          end
        end
        ```
        A malicious request like `/download/important_file.txt; ls -al` could execute arbitrary commands on the server.

*   **NoSQL Injection (if using NoSQL database):**
    *   If a Hanami application uses a NoSQL database like MongoDB and route parameters are used to construct queries, NoSQL injection is possible. The specific syntax and exploitation methods depend on the NoSQL database being used.

*   **Path Traversal (Local File Inclusion - LFI):**
    *   **Example:** Route `/view_template/{template_name}`. Action code (again, discouraged for direct user input):
        ```ruby
        module Web::Controllers::Templates
          class Show
            include Web::Action

            def call(params)
              template_path = "templates/#{params[:template_name]}.html.erb" # Potentially vulnerable
              if File.exist?(template_path)
                # ... render template ...
              else
                halt 404
              end
            end
          end
        end
        ```
        A malicious request like `/view_template/../../../../etc/passwd` could potentially access sensitive files outside the intended `templates` directory.

#### 4.4 Impact of Injection Vulnerabilities

The impact of successful injection attacks stemming from route parameter handling can be severe and include:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or file system. This can include user credentials, personal information, financial data, and confidential business information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption, loss of data integrity, and disruption of application functionality.
*   **Account Takeover:** Injections can be used to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing attackers to take over user accounts or administrative accounts.
*   **Code Execution:** Command injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This can be used to install malware, create backdoors, or launch further attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injections can be used to overload the database or server, causing the application to become unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Security breaches and data leaks can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Data breaches can lead to legal liabilities, fines, and regulatory penalties, especially in industries subject to data privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices for Hanami Applications

To effectively mitigate injection vulnerabilities arising from route parameter handling in Hanami applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

*   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, formats, and value ranges for each route parameter. Validate against these whitelists. For example, if an `id` should be an integer, ensure it is indeed an integer and within an acceptable range.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or encode special characters in route parameters before using them in sensitive operations. For example, when constructing SQL queries manually (though parameterized queries are preferred), properly escape single quotes, double quotes, and other special characters.
    *   **Hanami Validations:** Utilize Hanami's validation features within actions or dedicated validation classes to enforce input constraints. While not directly at the routing level, this provides a structured way to validate parameters within the action logic.

    ```ruby
    module Web::Controllers::Users
      class Show
        include Web::Action

        params do
          required(:id).filled(:integer) # Validate id as integer
        end

        def call(params)
          if params.valid?
            user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])
            # ... proceed with user logic ...
          else
            halt 422, params.errors.to_json # Handle validation errors
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
    *   **Hanami::Model's Query Builder:**  Utilize Hanami::Model's query builder, which automatically parameterizes queries, effectively preventing SQL injection. This is the **strongly recommended** approach for database interactions.

    ```ruby
    UserRepository.new.find_by_id(params[:id]) # Hanami::Model uses parameterized queries
    ```

    *   **Raw SQL with Parameterization (if necessary):** If you must use raw SQL queries, ensure you use the database adapter's parameterization features (e.g., prepared statements in PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). Avoid string interpolation to construct SQL queries with user-provided parameters.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:**
    *   Grant database users used by the Hanami application only the minimum necessary permissions required for their operations. Avoid using database users with `root` or `admin` privileges. This limits the potential damage if SQL injection occurs.

*   **Output Encoding (Context-Specific Output Encoding):**
    *   While primarily for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention, proper output encoding is also a general security best practice. Ensure that data retrieved from the database or other sources and displayed in views is properly encoded based on the output context (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML views, URL encoding for URLs). Hanami Views and template engines like ERB often provide automatic encoding, but developers should be aware of context-specific encoding needs.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including injection flaws related to route parameter handling.

*   **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**
    *   Educate developers about common injection vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of input validation and parameterized queries.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Hanami application. A WAF can help detect and block common injection attempts by analyzing HTTP requests and responses.

#### 4.6 Detection and Prevention

*   **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools to automatically scan Hanami application code for potential injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify patterns of unsafe parameter usage.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks on a running Hanami application and identify vulnerabilities, including injection flaws.
*   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct manual code reviews, specifically focusing on actions that handle route parameters and interact with databases, operating systems, or file systems.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual database queries or command execution attempts, which could indicate injection attacks.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Parameter Handling in Routes presents a significant attack surface in Hanami applications due to the framework's design choice to delegate input validation to developers. While this provides flexibility, it necessitates a strong security focus during development.

**Recommendations for Development Teams:**

1.  **Prioritize Input Validation:** Make input validation a core part of the development process for all Hanami actions that handle route parameters. Implement robust validation rules and error handling.
2.  **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  Adopt Hanami::Model's query builder or parameterized queries for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string interpolation with route parameters.
3.  **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure database users with minimal necessary permissions.
4.  **Conduct Regular Security Assessments:** Integrate security audits, penetration testing, and code reviews into the development lifecycle to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
5.  **Educate Developers on Secure Coding:** Provide security awareness training to developers, emphasizing injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices in Hanami.
