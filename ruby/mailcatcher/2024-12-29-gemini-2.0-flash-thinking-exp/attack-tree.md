## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Goal:** Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Data or Functionality by Exploiting Mailcatcher.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application via Mailcatcher **(Critical Node)**
    *   Exploit Mailcatcher's Web Interface **(Critical Node)**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) **(Critical Node)**
            *   Inject Malicious Script via Email Content **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   Insecure Authentication/Authorization **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            *   Exploit Default Credentials (if any) **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   Information Disclosure via Web Interface **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            *   Access Sensitive Data in Email Headers/Body **(High-Risk Path)**
    *   Access Captured Emails Directly (Bypassing Web Interface) **(Critical Node)**
        *   Access Underlying Data Store **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            *   Exploit Weak File Permissions **(High-Risk Path)**
    *   Exploit Interaction Between Application and Mailcatcher **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
        *   Application Misinterprets Captured Email Data **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            *   Inject Malicious Data via Email Subject/Body **(High-Risk Path)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Mailcatcher's Web Interface (Critical Node):**
    *   This is a critical entry point as it's the primary way users interact with Mailcatcher. Vulnerabilities here can grant attackers significant control or access to information.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Critical Node):**
    *   If Mailcatcher's web interface doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data (like email content), attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users viewing the interface.

*   **Inject Malicious Script via Email Content (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Insight: Mailcatcher displays email content. If it doesn't sanitize HTML/JS properly, an attacker can send a crafted email that, when viewed in Mailcatcher, executes malicious scripts in the browser of someone accessing the Mailcatcher interface.

*   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   Weak or missing authentication and authorization controls allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to Mailcatcher's features and data.

*   **Exploit Default Credentials (if any) (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Insight: If Mailcatcher ships with default credentials that are not changed, attackers can gain immediate access.

*   **Information Disclosure via Web Interface (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to view sensitive information directly through the web interface, even without full authentication bypass.

*   **Access Sensitive Data in Email Headers/Body (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Insight: Mailcatcher displays email content, which might contain sensitive information intended for the application (e.g., API keys, temporary passwords, internal IDs). An attacker gaining access to Mailcatcher can view this data.

*   **Access Captured Emails Directly (Bypassing Web Interface) (Critical Node):**
    *   Circumventing the intended web interface to access the underlying storage mechanism of the captured emails.

*   **Access Underlying Data Store (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   Directly accessing the files or database where Mailcatcher stores emails, bypassing the application logic.

*   **Exploit Weak File Permissions (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Insight: If Mailcatcher stores emails in files with overly permissive permissions, an attacker with access to the server could directly read the email contents.

*   **Exploit Interaction Between Application and Mailcatcher (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   Exploiting the way the target application interacts with the data stored in Mailcatcher.

*   **Application Misinterprets Captured Email Data (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   Vulnerabilities arising from the application's failure to properly validate or sanitize data retrieved from Mailcatcher.

*   **Inject Malicious Data via Email Subject/Body (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Insight: If the application parses email content from Mailcatcher without proper validation, an attacker could send a crafted email that, when processed by the application, leads to unintended consequences (e.g., bypassing authentication, injecting data into the application).
