The Draper system is architected around the following core components:

*   **User:** The individual or system interacting with Draper through the command-line interface to generate configuration files.
*   **Draper CLI:** The primary entry point for users, responsible for accepting commands and orchestrating the configuration generation process.
*   **Command Parser:**  This component is responsible for interpreting user commands, extracting arguments, and validating the syntax.
*   **Configuration Loader:**  Loads and validates various configuration files required by Draper, including the project configuration and variable definitions.
*   **Template Engine:**  Processes template files, identifying placeholders and substituting them with corresponding variable values.
*   **Plugin Manager:**  A central component that manages the discovery, loading, and execution of both Format and Source plugins.
*   **Format Plugin (e.g., YAML, JSON):**  Specialized plugins responsible for rendering the final configuration data into a specific file format.
*   **Generated Configuration File:** The resulting output file containing the application configuration, formatted according to the selected plugin.
*   **Source Plugin (e.g., Env Vars, File):** Plugins that provide mechanisms for loading variable data from external sources.

### 3.2. Component-Level Architecture

#### 3.2.1. Draper CLI

*   **Purpose:** To provide the main interface through which users interact with the Draper application.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receiving and interpreting commands entered by the user.
    *   Performing initial validation of user-provided input.
    *   Delegating specific tasks to the appropriate core logic components.
    *   Presenting feedback and output to the user.
    *   Handling command-line arguments and options.
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   `cli.py`:  Contains the main entry point for the CLI application and defines the command structure.
    *   `commands/`:  A directory containing modules that implement specific Draper commands (e.g., `generate`, `validate`, `list-plugins`).
    *   `utils/`:  Utility functions for common tasks like output formatting and error handling.

#### 3.2.2. Core Logic

*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate the core business logic and workflows for configuration generation.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Managing the loading and processing of all configuration data.
    *   Orchestrating the interaction between the Template Engine and Plugin Manager.
    *   Handling variable resolution and precedence.
    *   Implementing error handling and reporting for core operations.
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   `config/`:  Handles loading and validation of Draper project configuration files.
    *   `templating.py`:  Implements the logic for loading and processing template files, including variable substitution.
    *   `variables.py`:  Manages the loading, merging, and resolution of variables from different sources.
    *   `plugins/manager.py`:  The Plugin Manager, responsible for discovering, loading, and managing available plugins.

#### 3.2.3. Plugin Architecture

*   **Purpose:** To provide a flexible and extensible mechanism for supporting diverse configuration file formats and variable sources.

    *   Allowing users to extend Draper's capabilities without modifying the core codebase.
    *   Providing a mechanism for discovering and loading available plugins.
*   **Plugin Types:**
    *   **Format Plugins:**  Responsible for converting the processed configuration data into a specific output format (e.g., YAML, JSON, INI, XML). These plugins must implement a `render(data)` method.
    *   **Source Plugins:** Responsible for loading variable data from external sources (e.g., environment variables, files, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). These plugins must implement a `load()` method that returns a dictionary of variables.
*   **Plugin Interface:**
    *   Format plugins are expected to implement a `render(data: dict) -> str` method.
    *   Source plugins are expected to implement a `load() -> dict` method.
    *   Plugins should be self-contained and easily distributable.

#### 3.2.4. Configuration Files

*   **Draper Project Configuration (`draper.yaml` or `.draper.yaml`):** Defines the settings and structure for a specific Draper project.
    *   Specifies the location of template files and variable directories.
    *   Defines default variable values.
    *   Configures which plugins to use and their specific settings.
    *   May define environment-specific configurations.
*   **Template Files (`*.tpl` or similar):** Contain the structure of the target configuration file, using a templating language (e.g., Jinja2) to define placeholders for variables.
    *   Templates can include logic for conditional rendering and loops.
*   **Variable Files (`*.yaml`, `*.json`, etc.):** Contain definitions for variables that will be substituted into the templates.
    *   Support for various file formats is provided through Source Plugins.

The process of generating a configuration file involves the following steps:

*   The user initiates the process by issuing a command to the Draper CLI.
*   The Command Parser interprets the command and extracts relevant parameters.
*   The Draper project configuration is loaded, defining the project's settings.
*   The Plugin Manager loads the configured Source Plugins.
*   Source Plugins are invoked to load variables from their respective sources (e.g., environment variables, files).
*   Variable files specified in the project configuration are loaded.
*   The Variable Manager merges variables from all sources, handling precedence rules.
*   The specified template file is loaded into the Template Engine.
*   The Plugin Manager selects the appropriate Format Plugin based on the desired output format.
*   The Template Engine processes the template, substituting variables from the Variable Manager.
*   The processed configuration data is passed to the selected Format Plugin.
*   The Format Plugin renders the final configuration file in the specified format.

## 5. Key Technologies

*   **Core Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
*   **Templating Engine:** Jinja2 (for template processing and variable substitution)
*   **CLI Framework:** Click (for building user-friendly command-line interfaces)
*   **Plugin Management:** Python's `setuptools` entry points for dynamic plugin discovery and loading.
*   **Configuration File Parsing:**
    *   PyYAML for parsing YAML configuration files.
    *   json standard library for parsing JSON configuration files.
    *   Potentially `configparser` for INI files if supported.
*   **Testing Framework:** pytest (for unit and integration testing).
*   **Logging:** Python's `logging` module for application logging.

## 6. Deployment

Draper is designed to be deployed as a command-line tool, typically installed on developer workstations or within CI/CD pipelines.

*   **Installation:** Users can install Draper using `pip`: `pip install draper-cli`.
*   **Distribution:**  Packaged and distributed via Python Package Index (PyPI).
*   **Execution:** Users execute Draper commands directly from their terminal using the `draper` command.
*   **Dependencies:**  Installation will automatically handle dependencies specified in the `setup.py` file.

## 7. Security Considerations

This section outlines key security considerations for the Draper project. This information will be further elaborated upon during the dedicated threat modeling process.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   The Draper CLI must rigorously validate all user inputs, including command arguments and configuration file paths, to prevent command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Variable data loaded from external sources should be sanitized to prevent unexpected behavior during template rendering.
*   **Template Security:**
    *   The templating engine (Jinja2) should be used in a way that prevents the execution of arbitrary code within templates. Avoid using features that allow for direct code execution.
    *   Consider implementing a "safe" or "sandboxed" environment for template rendering.
*   **Secret Management:**
    *   Directly embedding secrets (API keys, passwords) within templates or configuration files is strongly discouraged.
    *   Draper should provide mechanisms or guidance for integrating with secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables with restricted access).
    *   Source Plugins for secret management should be designed with security best practices in mind.
*   **Plugin Security:**
    *   Plugins represent a potential attack surface. A mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of plugins should be considered (e.g., signing).
    *   Plugins should operate with the least privileges necessary.
    *   Consider sandboxing plugins to limit their access to system resources.
    *   Clearly document the security responsibilities of plugin developers.
*   **File System Access Control:**
    *   Draper requires read access to template and configuration files and write access to the output directory. Permissions should be configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Care should be taken to prevent Draper from writing to arbitrary file system locations.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   All project dependencies should be regularly reviewed and updated to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Error Handling and Information Disclosure:**
    *   Error messages should be informative but should not reveal sensitive information about the system's internal workings or configuration.
    *   Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
*   **Secure Defaults:**
    *   Draper should be configured with secure defaults. For example, features that could introduce security risks should be disabled by default.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  Explore the feasibility of developing a GUI for users who prefer a visual interface for managing configurations.
*   **Centralized Configuration Management Integration:** Investigate options for integrating Draper with centralized configuration management systems like Consul or etcd.
*   **Version Control System Integration:**  Provide built-in support for integrating with version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes to templates and configurations.
*   **Advanced Templating Features:**  Consider adding more advanced templating features, such as custom filters and functions, while maintaining security.
*   **Configuration Validation and Testing:** Implement features for validating generated configurations against predefined schemas or running tests against them.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Plugin Management:**  For larger deployments, consider implementing RBAC for managing and deploying plugins.

This improved design document provides a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the Draper project's architecture and functionality. It serves as a solid foundation for conducting thorough threat modeling and ensuring the security of the system.
