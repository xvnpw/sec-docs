*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Model Attributes via Decorator
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a poorly written or overly permissive decorator to access and expose sensitive attributes of the underlying model that should not be visible in the view context. This occurs because decorators in Draper have direct access to the attributes of the decorated object.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information about users, business data, or system internals could be disclosed, leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Draper Component:** Decorator class, specifically the methods within the decorator that access model attributes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing decorators, ensuring they only access the model attributes necessary for their specific presentation logic.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews of decorator implementations to identify potential over-exposure of sensitive data.
        *   Consider using whitelisting approaches to explicitly define which model attributes a decorator can access, rather than relying on implicit access to all attributes.
        *   Implement robust testing to verify that decorators do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.

*   **Threat:** Logic Errors in Decorator Methods Leading to Security Flaws
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities or bugs within the logic of decorator methods could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate data, bypass authorization checks, or cause other security issues. This is because Draper allows developers to embed custom logic within decorators that directly influences the presentation and potentially the interpretation of data.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for financial loss, unauthorized access, or manipulation of application data.
    *   **Affected Draper Component:** Decorator class, specifically the implementation of the methods within the decorator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices when developing decorator methods, including input validation and output encoding where necessary.
        *   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for decorator methods to identify and prevent logic errors.
        *   Conduct code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities in decorator logic.
