* **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into templates, which is then executed on the server during the site generation process.
    * **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's core functionality relies on templating engines (like ERB or Haml) to dynamically generate HTML. If user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is directly embedded into these templates without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for SSTI vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A poorly written helper function might take user input and directly embed it into an ERB template like `<%= params[:name] %>`. If `params[:name]` contains malicious code like `<% system('rm -rf /') %>`, Middleman's template rendering engine will execute this code during the build.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization/Escaping:** Always sanitize or escape user-provided data before embedding it in templates. Utilize the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms provided by Middleman's rendering process.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid granting excessive permissions to the Middleman build process to limit the impact of potential code execution.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review templates and helper functions for potential vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on how data is passed to Middleman's template rendering.

* **Helper Function Abuse**
    * **Description:** Malicious use of custom helper functions to execute unintended actions or access sensitive information.
    * **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's architecture encourages the use of helper functions to extend functionality within the site generation process. If these helpers, which are Ruby code executed by Middleman, are not carefully written and validated, they can introduce vulnerabilities directly within the Middleman application.
    * **Example:** A helper function in a Middleman project designed to read files might not properly validate the file path, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server during the Middleman build process.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary file access, or even code execution if the helper interacts with the system in a dangerous way during Middleman's build execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all inputs to helper functions used within the Middleman project.
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles when writing helper functions in Middleman, avoiding potentially dangerous operations like direct system calls based on user input.
        * **Regular Code Reviews:** Review helper function code within the Middleman project for potential security flaws.

* **Build Process Compromise**
    * **Description:** Attackers compromise the build process itself to inject malicious content into the generated website.
    * **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's build process involves executing Ruby code and potentially external scripts defined within the Middleman project. If the development environment or build pipeline used to generate the Middleman site is compromised, attackers can inject malicious code during this phase, directly affecting the output generated by Middleman.
    * **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the CI/CD pipeline used to build the Middleman site could modify the build script to inject malicious JavaScript into the generated HTML files that Middleman produces.
    * **Impact:** Injection of malicious code into the final website generated by Middleman, potentially leading to XSS, malware distribution, or other attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Development Environment:** Implement strong security measures for the development environment used for Middleman projects, including access controls and regular security updates.
        * **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Secure the CI/CD pipeline used to build Middleman sites with strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.
        * **Code Signing:** Consider signing generated assets from the Middleman build process to ensure their integrity.
