**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Middleman Application:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has gained unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying infrastructure by exploiting weaknesses specific to Middleman.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality:** This node is critical because it represents a broad category of attacks targeting the fundamental workings of Middleman. Successful exploitation here can lead to various high-impact outcomes through different sub-paths.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality -> Extension Vulnerabilities:** Middleman's extension system, while powerful, introduces a significant attack surface. Vulnerabilities in extensions can grant attackers substantial control over the application's behavior and data. This node is critical due to the potential for widespread impact depending on the compromised extension.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman's Dependencies:** Middleman relies on Ruby gems, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a common attack vector. This node is critical because exploiting these vulnerabilities can provide attackers with significant access and control, often with readily available exploits.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Inject malicious code into template data (e.g., YAML, JSON) used by templates:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into data sources (like YAML or JSON files) that are used by Middleman's templating engine. When these templates are rendered, the injected code is executed on the server during the build process.
    * **Potential Impact:** Code execution on the server, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or the ability to inject further malicious content into the generated website.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality -> Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Access sensitive information stored in `config.rb` (API keys, secrets):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the `config.rb` file, which may contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets stored in plaintext.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches through compromised credentials, and potential further compromise of related systems.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality -> Extension Vulnerabilities -> Utilize vulnerabilities in installed Middleman extensions:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the code of installed Middleman extensions.
    * **Potential Impact:** The impact varies widely depending on the functionality of the vulnerable extension. It could range from cross-site scripting (XSS) to remote code execution, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core Functionality -> Data Source Vulnerabilities -> Inject malicious code through external data sources (e.g., YAML, JSON files) used by Middleman:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to SSTI, attackers inject malicious code directly into external data files that Middleman processes during the build.
    * **Potential Impact:** Code execution during the build process, potentially leading to the injection of malicious content into the generated website or compromise of the build environment.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Middleman's Dependencies -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Ruby Gems -> Leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in gems used by Middleman:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in the Ruby gems that Middleman depends on. These vulnerabilities can often be exploited with readily available tools and techniques.
    * **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the compromised gem. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution or data breaches.

* **Exploit Misconfigurations Specific to Middleman -> Exposing Sensitive Information in Generated Files -> Accidentally include sensitive data in the generated static files:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers inadvertently include sensitive information (like API keys, credentials, or internal data) within the static files generated by Middleman. This information then becomes publicly accessible on the deployed website.
    * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems or services, and potential reputational damage.
