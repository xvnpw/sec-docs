## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Middleman [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_middleman__critical_node_.md)

*   **Compromise Application via Middleman [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_process__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Build Process [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Compromising the build process is a critical vulnerability as it allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into the application's core, affecting all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Gem Dependencies
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution on build server, potential data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Utilizing existing exploits, automated tools)
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring dependency updates and build logs)
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** Middleman relies on RubyGems. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to execute arbitrary code during the build process or in the generated application (if the vulnerability persists in the output).
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker identifies a vulnerable version of a Gem used by the Middleman project (e.g., a Markdown parser with a known remote code execution vulnerability). By crafting malicious content that triggers this vulnerability during the build, they can execute arbitrary commands on the build server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or modifying the generated output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_configuration_or_data_files__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Configuration or Data Files
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution on build server)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of templating engine and Middleman internals)
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (May not leave obvious traces in the final output)
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** If configuration files or data files allow for dynamic template rendering based on untrusted data, attackers can inject malicious code that executes on the server during the build process.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains access to a data file used by Middleman (e.g., a YAML file) and injects malicious template code. When Middleman processes this file, the injected code is executed on the server, potentially allowing the attacker to read files, execute commands, or compromise the build environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious File Processing (e.g., through vulnerable image processors or other assets) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_file_processing__e_g___through_vulnerable_image_processors_or_ef10ada5.md)

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious File Processing (e.g., through vulnerable image processors or other assets) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious File Processing (e.g., through vulnerable image processors or other assets)
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution on build server)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding and exploiting specific library vulnerabilities)
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring build process and file system changes)
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** Vulnerabilities in libraries used by Middleman to process files (e.g., image processing libraries) could be exploited to execute arbitrary code during the build.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library used by Middleman. During the build process, when Middleman attempts to process this image, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Build Script Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/build_script_manipulation__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Build Script Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modify `config.rb` or other build scripts to inject malicious code
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Full control over the build process and output)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires compromising developer accounts or systems)
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Can be disguised as legitimate changes)
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** Attackers who gain access to the development environment or version control system can modify the `config.rb` file or other build scripts to inject malicious code that executes during the build process.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine or gains access to the Git repository. They modify the `config.rb` file to include a malicious script that downloads and executes a backdoor on the build server during the deployment process.
