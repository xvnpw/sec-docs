# Threat Model Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Helpers](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_helpers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom Middleman helpers or through insecure use of templating language features (like ERB or Haml) to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server during the build process. This could involve manipulating data passed to helpers or crafting specific input that bypasses sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Successful SSTI allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server. This could lead to complete system compromise, access to sensitive environment variables, or the ability to modify the generated website content.
    *   **Affected Component:** Middleman Helpers, Templating Engine (ERB, Haml), Middleman::Core (during build process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided data or external data used within helpers.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution features within helpers if possible.
        *   Keep templating engine dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Implement strict input validation for data used in templates.
        *   Regularly review custom helpers for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Middleman Extension](./threats/malicious_middleman_extension.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker convinces a developer to install a malicious Middleman extension (gem) or exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate extension. The malicious extension could contain code that executes during the build process, modifies the generated output, or steals sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  A malicious extension can have a wide range of impacts, including injecting malicious code into the website, stealing API keys or other secrets, or compromising the build environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Middleman Extension API, Gemfile, Middleman::Core (during extension loading and execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully review the code of any extension before installing it.
        *   Use a dependency management tool (like Bundler) to track and manage gem dependencies.
        *   Regularly update gem dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Be cautious about installing extensions with excessive permissions or that perform unusual actions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_middleman_core.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities could exist in the core Middleman framework itself. These vulnerabilities could be exploited if the Middleman version is not kept up-to-date.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution during the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Middleman Core codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Middleman gem updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Middleman.
        *   Regularly review the Middleman changelog for security fixes.
