# Attack Surface Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious code can be injected into templates (e.g., `.erb`, `.haml`) that is then executed on the server during the build process.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman relies on templating engines to generate static content. If user-controlled data or data from untrusted sources is incorporated into templates without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A poorly implemented helper function takes user input and directly renders it within an ERB template without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject Ruby code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before incorporating it into templates.
        *   Avoid directly rendering raw user input in templates.
        *   Utilize the built-in escaping mechanisms provided by the templating engine.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom helper functions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Malicious or Vulnerable Helpers and Extensions](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_malicious_or_vulnerable_helpers_and_extensions.md)

*   **Description:**  Middleman's extensibility through helpers and extensions allows for the execution of arbitrary Ruby code. Vulnerabilities in these components or the inclusion of malicious ones can be exploited.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's architecture encourages the use of helpers and extensions to enhance functionality, increasing the potential attack surface if these components are not secure.
    *   **Example:** A third-party Middleman extension has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution, or a developer includes a malicious extension that compromises the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party helpers and extensions before using them.
        *   Keep all helpers and extensions up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement code reviews for custom helpers and extensions to identify potential security flaws.
        *   Restrict the permissions and capabilities of helpers and extensions where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities during the Build Process](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities_during_the_build_process.md)

*   **Description:**  If Middleman's configuration or custom scripts execute external commands based on user input or data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's build process might involve executing external tools or scripts, especially when using certain extensions or custom configurations.
    *   **Example:** A Middleman script uses user-provided data to construct a shell command for image processing without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the build server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user input or data from untrusted sources whenever possible.
        *   If external commands are necessary, use parameterized commands or secure libraries to prevent injection.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any input used in constructing external commands.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for the build process.
