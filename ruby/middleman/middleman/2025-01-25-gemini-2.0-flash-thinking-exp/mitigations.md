# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install a vulnerability scanning tool:** Add `bundler-audit` gem to your `Gemfile` as a development dependency: `gem 'bundler-audit', require: false, group: :development`.
    2.  **Run the scan regularly:** Integrate `bundler-audit` into your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline. Run `bundle audit` command before each commit and during CI builds.
    3.  **Review and remediate vulnerabilities:**  `bundler-audit` will report any vulnerabilities found in your gems. Review each reported vulnerability, assess its relevance to your application, and update the vulnerable gem to a patched version using `bundle update <vulnerable_gem>`. If no patch is available, consider alternative gems or mitigation measures suggested by security advisories.
    4.  **Automate vulnerability checks:** Configure your CI/CD system to automatically fail builds if `bundler-audit` detects high or critical severity vulnerabilities.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Dependency Exploitation (High Severity):**  Vulnerable RubyGems used by Middleman can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised or malicious RubyGems can be introduced into your project through dependency chains, leading to various security breaches within the Middleman application.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Vulnerable RubyGems might inadvertently expose sensitive information or configuration details of the Middleman application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Dependency Exploitation:** Significant risk reduction. Proactively identifies and addresses known vulnerabilities in RubyGems before they can be exploited in the Middleman application.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Moderate risk reduction. Helps detect known vulnerabilities in RubyGems dependencies, but doesn't prevent all supply chain risks (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities in gems).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderate risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of information disclosure through vulnerable RubyGems used by Middleman.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   `bundler-audit` gem is included in `Gemfile` (development group).
        *   Manual `bundle audit` is run occasionally by developers before major releases.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated `bundle audit` in CI/CD pipeline is not configured.
        *   Automated build failure on high/critical vulnerability detection is not implemented.
        *   Regular scheduled `bundle audit` runs are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management with Environment Variables](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_with_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify sensitive configuration in `config.rb`:**  Determine configuration settings within your Middleman `config.rb` file that are sensitive (API keys, database credentials if used dynamically, secret keys, etc.).
    2.  **Replace hardcoded values in `config.rb` with environment variables:**  In `config.rb`, replace hardcoded sensitive values with calls to `ENV['VARIABLE_NAME']`. For example, instead of `api_key = "your_secret_key"`, use `api_key = ENV['API_KEY']`. This makes Middleman read configuration from environment variables.
    3.  **Set environment variables outside of the Middleman codebase:** Configure environment variables in your deployment environment (e.g., server configuration, container orchestration, CI/CD secrets management).  **Do not** commit sensitive values directly into your `config.rb` or version control.
    4.  **Use `.env` files for local development (with caution):** For local development with Middleman, you can use a `.env` file (added to `.gitignore`) to set environment variables. However, ensure `.env` files are never deployed to production. Use environment-specific configuration methods in production.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in Middleman's `config.rb` risks accidental commit to version control, making them accessible to anyone with repository access.
        *   **Configuration Drift between Environments (Medium Severity):** Hardcoded configurations in `config.rb` can lead to inconsistencies between development, staging, and production environments for your Middleman site, potentially causing unexpected behavior and security issues.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Code Access (Medium Severity):** If an attacker gains access to the Middleman codebase (e.g., through a compromised server), hardcoded secrets in `config.rb` are immediately exposed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** Significant risk reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of secrets within the Middleman project's codebase.
        *   **Configuration Drift between Environments:** Moderate risk reduction. Promotes consistent configuration across environments for the Middleman application by centralizing configuration management.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Code Access:** Moderate risk reduction. Secrets are not directly accessible within the Middleman codebase itself, requiring additional steps for an attacker to retrieve them from the environment where Middleman is running.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   Some API keys for external services used by Middleman are loaded from environment variables in production.
        *   Database credentials (if dynamic features are used with Middleman) in production are managed through environment variables.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Secret keys used for signing or encryption within the Middleman application (if any) are still hardcoded in `config.rb`.
        *   Development environment still relies on hardcoded values in `config.rb` in some areas instead of `.env` files (properly ignored by `.gitignore`).
        *   No consistent strategy for managing all sensitive configuration across all environments for the Middleman project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_auditing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Research plugin reputation before adding to Middleman project:** Before using a new Middleman plugin, research its source, maintainer, community activity, and any known security issues. Check the plugin's RubyGems page and GitHub repository (if available) for recent commits, open issues, and security-related discussions.
    2.  **Review plugin code (if possible) for Middleman plugins:** If the Middleman plugin is open-source, review its code for potential vulnerabilities or malicious code. Pay attention to how it interacts with Middleman's core, handles user input (if any), interacts with external services, and manages sensitive data within the Middleman context.
    3.  **Test plugin in a non-production Middleman environment:** Before deploying a new plugin to production for your Middleman site, thoroughly test it in a staging or development Middleman environment to ensure it functions as expected and doesn't introduce any unexpected security issues or conflicts within the Middleman application.
    4.  **Monitor plugin updates and vulnerabilities for Middleman plugins:** Subscribe to the plugin's release notes or watch its repository for updates and security advisories relevant to your Middleman project. Promptly update Middleman plugins when security patches are released.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Plugin Injection (High Severity):** A compromised or malicious Middleman plugin can introduce backdoors, steal data generated by Middleman, or perform other malicious actions within your Middleman application's build or runtime (if dynamic features are used).
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Middleman plugins, like RubyGems, can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit within the context of your Middleman application.
        *   **Plugin Compatibility Issues (Low Severity - Security Impact):** Incompatible or poorly written Middleman plugins can introduce unexpected behavior or instability in your Middleman site generation process, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or denial of service during site build or runtime (if dynamic features are used).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Plugin Injection:** Significant risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of introducing malicious code through Middleman plugins by careful vetting.
        *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Moderate risk reduction. Helps identify and avoid using Middleman plugins with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin Compatibility Issues:** Minor risk reduction (indirect security impact). Improves Middleman application stability and reduces the chance of unexpected security-related issues caused by plugin conflicts during site generation.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   Developers generally choose Middleman plugins from reputable sources and check for basic functionality.
        *   Plugin updates for Middleman are performed periodically, but not always immediately upon release.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal plugin vetting process for Middleman plugins is not defined or consistently followed.
        *   Code review of Middleman plugins is not regularly performed.
        *   Automated plugin vulnerability scanning specifically for Middleman plugins is not implemented (beyond general gem dependency scanning).
        *   No systematic monitoring of Middleman plugin updates and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Code and Deployment Security for Middleman Projects](./mitigation_strategies/source_code_and_deployment_security_for_middleman_projects.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure `.gitignore` configuration for Middleman projects:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file in your Middleman project properly excludes sensitive files and directories from being committed to version control, such as `.env` files, API keys, any local data files containing secrets, and development-specific Middleman configuration files that should not be in production.
    2.  **Implement secure deployment processes for Middleman sites:**  Automate your deployment process for Middleman generated sites to minimize manual steps and potential errors. Ensure your deployment pipeline does not expose sensitive files like the `.git` directory, Middleman development configuration, or source code to the production environment. Only deploy the generated static site output (`build` directory by default).
    3.  **Remove unnecessary files from Middleman production builds:**  Optimize your Middleman build process to only include necessary files for the production site in the `build` output. Remove development-related Middleman files, configuration files (like `config.rb` itself if it contains sensitive info not managed by env vars), and any other files that are not required for the live static site to reduce potential information leakage from the deployed Middleman site.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control (High Severity):**  Accidentally committing sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, configuration with secrets) from your Middleman project to version control.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Deployment (Medium Severity):**  Deploying unnecessary files from your Middleman project (e.g., `.git`, source code, development configurations) to the production environment, potentially exposing sensitive information or development details.
        *   **Attack Surface Expansion (Low Severity):**  Including unnecessary files in the production build of your Middleman site increases the potential attack surface, even for a static site, by providing more files for attackers to potentially analyze or exploit.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** Significant risk reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of secrets related to your Middleman project in the codebase.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Deployment:** Moderate risk reduction. Reduces the risk of information leakage from the deployed Middleman site by minimizing the files deployed.
        *   **Attack Surface Expansion:** Minor risk reduction. Slightly reduces the attack surface of the deployed Middleman site by removing unnecessary files.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   `.gitignore` generally excludes common files like `.env` and `node_modules` (if used with Middleman).
        *   Deployment process generally only deploys the `build` directory.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `.gitignore` might not be comprehensive enough to exclude all potential sensitive files specific to the Middleman project.
        *   Deployment process might not be fully automated and might still involve manual steps that could lead to accidental inclusion of unnecessary files.
        *   Build process optimization to strictly minimize files in the `build` output might not be fully implemented.
