# Deep Analysis: Build-Time Template Injection (Server-Side) in Middleman

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the "Build-Time Template Injection (Server-Side)" attack surface within a Middleman application.  The goal is to understand the specific mechanisms by which this vulnerability can manifest, identify potential attack vectors, and provide concrete recommendations for prevention and mitigation.  We will focus on how Middleman's architecture and build process contribute to this risk.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on server-side template injection vulnerabilities that occur *during the Middleman build process*.  This includes:

*   **Custom Build Scripts:**  Ruby scripts or extensions that are part of the Middleman build pipeline (e.g., scripts invoked by `config.rb`, custom helpers, or external scripts executed during the build).
*   **Middleman Extensions:**  Third-party or custom-built Middleman extensions that interact with the templating engine during the build.
*   **Data Sources:**  External data sources (files, databases, APIs) that are read and used within templates *during the build*.  This excludes data used dynamically at runtime after deployment.
*   **Templating Engines:**  The templating engines used by Middleman during the build, primarily ERB, but also potentially others like Haml or Slim if configured.
* **Middleman Configuration:** The `config.rb` file and any other configuration files that might influence how data is processed during the build.

This analysis *excludes* client-side template injection and runtime server-side template injection (which would be a separate attack surface).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Middleman project's `config.rb`, custom helper files, and any custom build scripts or extensions for patterns that indicate the use of external data within templates during the build.  Look for instances where data is read from files, databases, or other external sources and incorporated into templates without proper sanitization or escaping.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identify any Middleman extensions or external libraries used in the build process that might introduce template injection vulnerabilities.  Review their documentation and source code (if available) for known vulnerabilities or insecure practices.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Based on the code review and dependency analysis, identify specific scenarios where an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into templates during the build.  This includes identifying the input sources (e.g., specific files, database fields) and the vulnerable code paths.
4.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Develop hypothetical exploit scenarios to demonstrate the potential impact of the vulnerability.  This will help to illustrate the severity of the risk and the need for mitigation.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**  Based on the findings, refine and prioritize the mitigation strategies, providing specific examples and code snippets where applicable.
6. **Documentation:** Document all findings, attack vectors, exploit scenarios, and mitigation recommendations in a clear and concise manner.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Middleman's Build Process and Templating

Middleman's core functionality revolves around transforming source files (Markdown, HTML, templates) into a static website.  This transformation happens during the *build process*, which is initiated by the `middleman build` command.  The build process heavily relies on templating engines, primarily ERB, to render dynamic content.

The `config.rb` file is central to configuring the build process.  It can contain Ruby code that executes during the build, including custom helpers, data loading, and manipulation of the build pipeline.  This is a key area where vulnerabilities can be introduced.

### 4.2. Potential Attack Vectors

Several scenarios can lead to build-time template injection:

*   **Unsafe Data Loading in `config.rb`:**

    ```ruby
    # config.rb (VULNERABLE)
    data.user_content = File.read("user_provided.txt")
    ```

    If `user_provided.txt` contains ERB code (e.g., `<%= system('ls -la') %>`), and this `data.user_content` is later used *unsafely* within a template, it will execute the injected code during the build.  The attacker controls the contents of `user_provided.txt`.

*   **Custom Helpers with Unsafe Input:**

    ```ruby
    # helpers/custom_helpers.rb (VULNERABLE)
    module CustomHelpers
      def render_user_data(filename)
        content = File.read(filename)
        # Directly embedding potentially unsafe content into the template
        "<div>#{content}</div>"
      end
    end
    ```

    If a template uses this helper with a user-controlled filename (even indirectly), an attacker could create a file with malicious ERB code.

*   **Third-Party Extensions:**  A Middleman extension might have a vulnerability that allows for template injection during the build.  This is less direct but still a significant risk.  For example, an extension that processes data from an external source and uses it in a template without proper escaping.

*   **Data Files with Embedded ERB:** If Middleman is configured to treat data files (e.g., YAML, JSON) as templates, and these files contain user-supplied data, an attacker could inject ERB code into the data file itself.

    ```yaml
    # data/user_data.yml (VULNERABLE)
    message: "Hello, <%= system('whoami') %>"
    ```
    If `user_data.yml` is used in a template, the `whoami` command will be executed.

### 4.3. Exploit Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Compromising the Build Server:** An attacker uploads a file named `user_provided.txt` containing `<%= system('rm -rf /') %>`.  The vulnerable `config.rb` code (shown above) reads this file, and the injected code executes during the build, potentially wiping the build server.

*   **Scenario 2: Data Exfiltration:** An attacker uploads a file containing `<%= File.read('/etc/passwd') %>`.  The build process executes this code, and the contents of `/etc/passwd` are embedded into the generated static site, potentially exposing sensitive information.

*   **Scenario 3: Installing a Backdoor:** An attacker injects code that downloads and executes a malicious script, establishing a persistent backdoor on the build server.  This could be done by injecting code that uses `curl` or `wget` to fetch the script and then executes it using `system` or backticks.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

*   **1. Avoid User Input in Templates (Build-Time):** This is the most effective mitigation.  Restructure the application logic to avoid using user-supplied data directly within templates during the build process.  If data needs to be displayed, pre-process and sanitize it *before* it reaches the templating stage.  Generate static data files that contain only the necessary, sanitized information.

*   **2. Strict Input Validation:** If user input *must* be used, implement rigorous validation.  This goes beyond simple type checking.  Consider:

    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters or patterns and reject any input that doesn't conform.  This is generally preferred over blacklisting.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use carefully crafted regular expressions to validate the format and content of the input.  Be extremely cautious with regular expressions, as poorly designed ones can be bypassed or lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities (ReDoS).
    *   **Length Limits:** Impose reasonable length limits on input to prevent excessively long strings that could cause performance issues or buffer overflows.
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that the input conforms to the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).

*   **3. Proper Escaping (Templating Engine Specific):** Use the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms.  For ERB, this is primarily the `h` method (or `<%=h ... %>`):

    ```ruby
    # config.rb (SAFE)
    data.user_content = File.read("user_provided.txt")

    # In the template:
    <%=h data.user_content %>
    ```

    This will HTML-escape the content, preventing it from being interpreted as ERB code.  If using other templating engines (Haml, Slim), use their respective escaping mechanisms.  Understand the context of escaping (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) and use the appropriate method.

*   **4. Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Middleman build process with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Do *not* run the build as root or with an account that has excessive permissions.  Create a dedicated user account with limited access to only the directories and resources required for the build.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully exploit a template injection vulnerability.

*   **5. Sandboxing (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider running the build process within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container, a virtual machine, or a chroot jail).  This isolates the build process from the rest of the system, further limiting the impact of a successful attack.

*   **6. Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Middleman project, including code reviews, dependency analysis, and penetration testing.  This helps to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

*   **7. Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Middleman, its extensions, and any other dependencies to the latest versions.  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in newer releases.

* **8. Content Security Policy (CSP) - Limited Applicability:** While CSP is primarily a browser-based security mechanism, it *can* offer some limited protection in this context. If the build process generates HTML that includes inline scripts or styles based on user input, a strict CSP could prevent the execution of injected code *if* the generated HTML is later viewed in a browser. However, this is a secondary defense and does *not* prevent the server-side code execution during the build. It's crucial to understand that CSP primarily mitigates client-side risks, not the server-side build-time injection itself.

## 5. Conclusion

Build-time template injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to complete compromise of the build server.  Middleman's reliance on templating engines during the build process makes it susceptible to this attack if user-supplied data is not handled carefully.  By following the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability and ensure the security of their Middleman applications.  The most important principle is to avoid using user input directly in templates during the build process whenever possible. If it's unavoidable, rigorous input validation, proper escaping, and the principle of least privilege are essential.
