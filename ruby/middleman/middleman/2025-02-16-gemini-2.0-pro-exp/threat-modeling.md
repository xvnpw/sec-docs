# Threat Model Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Threat: [Build Script Manipulation (`config.rb` or Rake tasks)](./threats/build_script_manipulation___config_rb__or_rake_tasks_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the source code repository or the build server and modifies the `config.rb` file or any custom Rake tasks used in the Middleman build process. The attacker inserts malicious code that will be executed during the next build, leveraging Middleman's build process directly.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection:** The attacker can inject arbitrary code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) into the generated static site, which will be executed in the browsers of site visitors.
        *   **Build Process Hijacking:** The attacker can completely alter the build process to produce a compromised site, redirect users, or exfiltrate data, all through manipulating Middleman's configuration and build scripts.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker could modify the build scripts to send sensitive data processed by Middleman to a remote server.
    *   **Affected Middleman Component:** `config.rb`, any custom Rake tasks defined in `Rakefile` or included files, any scripts executed during the Middleman build via its configuration. This directly impacts Middleman's core build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls on the source code repository and the build server. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Require code reviews for *any* changes to build scripts (`config.rb`, Rake tasks).
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of build scripts *before* Middleman executes them.
        *   **CI/CD Security:** Use a secure CI/CD pipeline with automated security checks and limited access, specifically monitoring for changes to Middleman's configuration.
        *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit build scripts for unauthorized changes, focusing on `config.rb` and related files.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage During Build (via Middleman Configuration)](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_during_build__via_middleman_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** The Middleman build process, as configured in `config.rb` or through Middleman helpers, uses sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.). This data is accidentally exposed through:
        *   Hardcoding in `config.rb` or other source files processed by Middleman.
        *   Accidental inclusion in the generated static files due to misconfiguration of Middleman's `ignore` or similar settings.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access other services or data associated with those credentials. This is a direct consequence of how Middleman is configured and used.
    *   **Affected Middleman Component:** `config.rb`, any code that interacts with external APIs or services during the Middleman build *as configured through Middleman*, Middleman's `ignore` and related file handling configurations, the generated output directory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables, *never* hardcode them in `config.rb` or files processed by Middleman.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate it with the Middleman build process.
        *   **Configuration Exclusion:** Ensure that sensitive files and directories are *explicitly* excluded from the generated output using Middleman's `ignore` configuration option and related settings.  Thoroughly test these exclusions.
        *   **Secure Helpers:** Utilize any Middleman helpers or extensions specifically designed for secure handling of secrets, and ensure they are used correctly.

## Threat: [Insecure `config.rb` Settings (Direct Middleman Misconfiguration)](./threats/insecure__config_rb__settings__direct_middleman_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** The `config.rb` file, which controls Middleman's core behavior, contains insecure settings.  This includes enabling features that expose internal data or using weak default configurations that are specific to Middleman's functionality. Examples include accidentally exposing source files or enabling features that could lead to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of internal files, directory structures, or potentially sensitive information about the project *due to Middleman's configuration*.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Enabling unnecessary Middleman features can increase the attack surface.
    *   **Affected Middleman Component:** `config.rb`, Middleman's core configuration system and the features it controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review the `config.rb` file and understand the security implications of *each* setting, referencing Middleman's official documentation.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Middleman features that are not absolutely required for the site's functionality.
        *   **Best Practices:** Follow Middleman's security best practices documentation meticulously.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** If available, use a linter or configuration validator specifically designed for Middleman's `config.rb` to catch potential misconfigurations.
