# Attack Surface Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Build-Time)](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_vulnerabilities__build-time_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities in Ruby gems (dependencies) used by Middleman during the build process.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman *directly* relies on a set of Ruby gems for its core functionality. The selection and management of these dependencies are inherent to Middleman's operation and build process.
*   **Example:** An outdated version of the `nokogiri` gem (used for HTML parsing) with a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is present in the project's `Gemfile.lock`. An attacker could exploit this during the build process, potentially compromising the build server.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the build server, potential injection of malicious code into the generated static site, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Use `bundle update` frequently to keep gems up-to-date.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ tools like `bundler-audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Gemfile.lock:** Use and maintain a `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent and reproducible builds, but remember to update it regularly.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Consider pinning critical dependencies to known-secure versions (with careful consideration of compatibility).
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** For high-security projects, manually audit the source code of critical dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Extension-Related Vulnerabilities (Build-Time)](./attack_surfaces/2__extension-related_vulnerabilities__build-time_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in custom or third-party Middleman extensions that can be exploited during the build process.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman's extension system *directly* allows developers to add custom functionality, which inherently introduces a risk if those extensions are not secure. The execution of these extensions is a core part of Middleman's build process.
*   **Example:** A poorly written extension that processes user-supplied data (e.g., from a form submission during a custom build script) without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to command injection.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the build server, potential injection of malicious code, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Extension Vetting:** Thoroughly review the code of any third-party extensions before use.
    *   **Prefer Reputable Extensions:** Choose well-maintained and widely-used extensions from trusted sources.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep extensions updated to their latest versions.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** If writing custom extensions, follow secure coding principles and conduct thorough security testing.
    *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate any data processed by extensions, especially if it originates from external sources.

## Attack Surface: [3. Secret Exposure in Configuration (Build-Time)](./attack_surfaces/3__secret_exposure_in_configuration__build-time_.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of sensitive information (API keys, deployment credentials) stored directly in Middleman's configuration files (e.g., `config.rb`).
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman *directly* uses configuration files (primarily `config.rb`) to manage build settings. While the vulnerability is due to developer action, it occurs within a file *directly* managed and used by Middleman.
*   **Example:** An AWS access key ID and secret access key are hardcoded in `config.rb`, and the file is accidentally committed to a public Git repository.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cloud resources, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Store Secrets in Code:** Absolutely avoid storing secrets directly in `config.rb` or any other version-controlled file.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables (e.g., `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']`) to manage sensitive configuration.
    *   **Secrets Management Solutions:** Employ dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
    *   **.gitignore:** Ensure that sensitive files and directories (e.g., `.env`, files containing secrets) are explicitly excluded from version control using a `.gitignore` file.
    *   **Regular Repository Audits:** Periodically review the repository's history to ensure no secrets have been accidentally committed.

## Attack Surface: [4. Build-Time Template Injection (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/4__build-time_template_injection__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerability where user-supplied data is unsafely used within templates *during the build process*, leading to server-side template injection (SSTI).
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman *directly* uses templating engines (like ERB) during its build process.  If a custom build script or extension improperly handles external data within these templates, this vulnerability can arise *directly* within Middleman's operation.
*   **Example:** A custom build script takes user input from a file and directly inserts it into an ERB template without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary Ruby code.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the build server, potential code execution, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User Input in Templates (Build-Time):** Minimize or eliminate the use of user-supplied data directly within templates during the build.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** If external data *must* be used, rigorously validate and sanitize it before incorporating it into templates.
    *   **Proper Escaping:** Use the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., ERB's `h` method for HTML escaping) to prevent code injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run build processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
