# Deep Analysis: Insecure `config.rb` Settings in Middleman

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to identify specific, actionable vulnerabilities stemming from insecure configurations within Middleman's `config.rb` file, and to provide concrete remediation steps beyond the general mitigation strategies already outlined in the threat model.  We aim to move from a high-level understanding of the threat to a detailed examination of potential attack vectors and their corresponding defenses.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `config.rb` file and the settings it controls *within the context of a Middleman static site generator*.  It does *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in third-party Middleman extensions (these would be separate threats).
*   General web application security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) that are not directly caused by Middleman's configuration.  While `config.rb` *can* influence these, they are broader topics.
*   Server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., in Apache, Nginx) that are unrelated to Middleman's configuration.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Ruby environment itself.

The scope is limited to misconfigurations *specific to Middleman's features and how they are enabled/disabled via `config.rb`*.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Configuration Parameter Enumeration:**  Identify key configuration parameters in `config.rb` that, if misconfigured, could lead to security vulnerabilities.  This will involve consulting the official Middleman documentation and community resources.
2.  **Vulnerability Scenario Analysis:** For each identified parameter, construct realistic scenarios where an insecure setting could be exploited.
3.  **Exploitation Demonstration (Conceptual):**  Describe, conceptually, how an attacker might exploit the vulnerability.  We will not perform actual exploitation on a live system.
4.  **Remediation Recommendation:** Provide specific, actionable steps to remediate each identified vulnerability, going beyond the general mitigations in the threat model.
5.  **Automated Detection (where possible):** Suggest methods for automatically detecting insecure configurations, such as through linters or custom scripts.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Key Configuration Parameters and Potential Vulnerabilities

Based on Middleman's documentation and common usage patterns, the following `config.rb` settings are particularly relevant to security:

*   **`http_prefix` / `asset_host`:**  Incorrectly configuring these can lead to mixed content issues or expose the site to attacks if assets are served from an untrusted source.  This is especially important when using a CDN.
*   **`directory_indexes`:**  While seemingly benign, disabling directory indexes (`set :directory_indexes, false`) can sometimes *hide* the presence of sensitive files that would otherwise be listed.  The better approach is to *not have sensitive files in the build directory at all*.
*   **`build_dir`:**  The location where Middleman outputs the static site.  It's crucial that this directory is *not* within the source directory and that it's properly protected by server-side configurations (e.g., `.htaccess` or Nginx configuration).  An insecure `build_dir` could expose source files if the web server isn't configured to prevent access to them.
*   **`source`:** Defines the source directory.  Accidentally exposing files outside of what's intended to be built can lead to information disclosure.
*   **`ignore`:**  Used to exclude files and directories from the build process.  Failure to properly ignore sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, configuration backups) can lead to their inclusion in the static output.
*   **`activate` (for extensions):**  Activating unnecessary or poorly-vetted extensions can introduce vulnerabilities.  Each extension should be carefully reviewed for security implications.
* **Custom Helpers:** If custom helpers are defined in `config.rb` or included files, they should be reviewed for potential vulnerabilities like XSS or file inclusion issues.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Scenarios and Exploitation

Let's examine some specific scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Source File Exposure via `build_dir` Misconfiguration**

*   **Vulnerable Configuration:**  `set :build_dir, "source/public"` (placing the build directory *inside* the source directory).  The web server is configured to serve files from the `source` directory.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially access source files (e.g., `source/config.rb`, `source/data/*.yml`) directly through the web server, bypassing Middleman's intended build process.  This could expose sensitive data or reveal internal logic.
*   **Remediation:**  Set `build_dir` to a directory *outside* the source directory (e.g., `set :build_dir, "build"`).  Ensure the web server is configured to serve only from the `build` directory.

**Scenario 2: Sensitive Data Exposure via `ignore` Misconfiguration**

*   **Vulnerable Configuration:**  A `.env` file containing API keys or database credentials is *not* listed in the `ignore` configuration.
*   **Exploitation:** Middleman includes the `.env` file in the build output.  An attacker can access the file directly (e.g., `example.com/.env`) and obtain sensitive credentials.
*   **Remediation:**  Explicitly ignore the `.env` file (and any other sensitive files) in `config.rb`: `ignore '.env'`.  Consider using a more secure method for managing secrets, such as environment variables set at the server level.

**Scenario 3: Mixed Content via `http_prefix` Misconfiguration**

*   **Vulnerable Configuration:**  The site is served over HTTPS, but `http_prefix` is set to `http://example.com`.
*   **Exploitation:**  Browsers will flag the site as having mixed content, potentially blocking assets and degrading the user experience.  This can also create opportunities for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Remediation:**  Ensure `http_prefix` is either not set (Middleman will usually auto-detect) or explicitly set to the correct HTTPS URL: `set :http_prefix, "https://example.com"`.  If using a CDN, configure `asset_host` appropriately.

**Scenario 4: Information Disclosure via Directory Indexes (Indirect)**

* **Vulnerable Configuration:** `set :directory_indexes, false` *and* sensitive files exist within a build directory, but are not linked from anywhere.
* **Exploitation:** While directory indexes are disabled, an attacker who *guesses* the filename of a sensitive file (e.g., `backup.zip`) can still access it. Disabling directory indexes only prevents *listing* the files, not accessing them directly.
* **Remediation:** The primary remediation is to *never* place sensitive files in the build directory. Use `ignore` to prevent them from being included in the build. If directory indexes are disabled for other reasons, ensure that no sensitive files are present that could be accessed by guessing their names.

**Scenario 5: Extension-Related Vulnerability**

* **Vulnerable Configuration:** `activate :some_poorly_vetted_extension`
* **Exploitation:** The activated extension contains a vulnerability (e.g., a file inclusion vulnerability or an XSS vulnerability). The attacker exploits this vulnerability through the extension's functionality.
* **Remediation:**
    *   **Avoid unnecessary extensions:** Only activate extensions that are absolutely required.
    *   **Vet extensions carefully:** Review the extension's code for security issues before activating it. Look for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Keep extensions updated:** Regularly update extensions to the latest versions to patch any security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider alternatives:** If a secure alternative to an extension exists, use it.

### 2.3 Automated Detection

*   **Custom Script:** A Ruby script could be written to parse the `config.rb` file and check for common insecure settings.  This script could:
    *   Verify that `build_dir` is outside the `source` directory.
    *   Check for the presence of sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `*.bak`) in the `ignore` list.
    *   Warn about the use of potentially dangerous extensions.
    *   Check `http_prefix` and `asset_host` for consistency with the site's protocol (HTTPS).
*   **Linting (Limited):**  While a dedicated Middleman `config.rb` linter might not be widely available, general Ruby linters (like RuboCop) could be used to enforce coding style and potentially catch some basic errors.  However, they won't be able to detect Middleman-specific misconfigurations.
* **Regular expressions:** Use regular expressions to find dangerous patterns.

### 2.4 Conclusion
The `config.rb` file is a critical component of a Middleman site's security. Misconfigurations can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, primarily information disclosure. By carefully reviewing the configuration, understanding the implications of each setting, and following security best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities. Automated checks can further enhance security by detecting potential misconfigurations early in the development process.
