# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit and Update Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_and_update_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dependencies:** Use `bundle list` to see all gems used by the project.
    2.  **Check for Outdated Gems:** Run `bundle outdated` to identify gems with newer versions available.
    3.  **Research Vulnerabilities:** For each outdated gem, check vulnerability databases (RubySec, Snyk, GitHub Advisories) for known security issues.
    4.  **Prioritize Updates:** Focus on updating gems with known vulnerabilities, especially those with high or critical severity.
    5.  **Update Gems:** Use `bundle update <gem_name>` to update a specific gem, or `bundle update` to update all gems (with caution).
    6.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, run comprehensive tests (unit, integration, acceptance) to ensure no regressions were introduced.
    7.  **Update Gemfile.lock:** After successful testing, commit the updated `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent dependencies across environments.
    8.  **Schedule Regular Audits:** Repeat this process regularly (e.g., weekly, monthly) as part of your development workflow.
    9.  **Consider Dependency Pinning:**  For critical libraries, consider pinning to specific, known-good versions in the `Gemfile` (e.g., `gem 'nokogiri', '1.13.3'`) to prevent unexpected updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Vulnerabilities in gems can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server (during build or if Middleman is used in a non-static way).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Some vulnerabilities can be exploited to crash the application or make it unresponsive (during build).
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities might allow attackers to access or modify sensitive data (if Middleman interacts with data sources).
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: Medium-High):**  Vulnerabilities in gems used for templating or data handling could introduce XSS risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Significantly reduces the risk of RCE by patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **DoS:** Reduces the likelihood of DoS attacks exploiting known gem vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Reduces the risk of data breaches stemming from vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **XSS:** Indirectly reduces XSS risk by ensuring underlying libraries are secure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are used to manage dependencies.
    *   Occasional manual checks for outdated gems using `bundle outdated`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., `bundler-audit`) is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Regular, scheduled dependency audits are not formally part of the development workflow.
    *   Dependency pinning is not consistently used for critical libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use a Ruby/Rails Vulnerability Scanner](./mitigation_strategies/use_a_rubyrails_vulnerability_scanner.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Scanner:** Select a suitable vulnerability scanner (e.g., `brakeman` for static analysis, `bundler-audit` for dependency checks).
    2.  **Install the Scanner:** Follow the scanner's installation instructions (usually via `gem install`).
    3.  **Run the Scanner:** Execute the scanner against your Middleman project (e.g., `brakeman`, `bundle audit`).
    4.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully review the scanner's output, paying attention to high and critical severity findings.
    5.  **Address Vulnerabilities:** For each identified vulnerability:
        *   Understand the root cause.
        *   Implement the recommended fix (e.g., code changes, dependency updates).
        *   Test the fix thoroughly.
    6.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Add the scanner to your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automatically scan for vulnerabilities on every code change.
    7.  **Configure Alerting:** Set up alerts to notify developers of new vulnerabilities found by the scanner.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RCE (Severity: Critical):** Detects code patterns and dependencies that could lead to RCE.
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** (Less relevant for *purely* static sites, but `brakeman` can still detect potential issues if interacting with external data sources during build).
    *   **XSS (Severity: Medium-High):** Identifies potential XSS vulnerabilities in templates and helpers.
    *   **Mass Assignment (Severity: Medium):** (Less relevant for *purely* static sites, but `brakeman` can detect this if interacting with external data during build).
    *   **Other Common Rails Vulnerabilities:** Detects a wide range of security flaws common in Ruby on Rails applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE, SQL Injection, XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of these vulnerabilities by providing early detection.
    *   **Overall Security Posture:** Improves the overall security of the application by identifying and addressing potential weaknesses.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No vulnerability scanner is currently used.
    *   No integration with the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Commit Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/never_commit_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine what constitutes sensitive data (API keys, passwords, database credentials, secret keys, etc.).
    2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables, *not* in the codebase.
    3.  **Access Environment Variables:** In your Middleman code (e.g., `config.rb`, helpers), access environment variables using `ENV['VARIABLE_NAME']`.
    4.  **Use a `.env` File (Local Development Only):** For local development, use a `.env` file to store environment variables.  **Never commit the `.env` file.**
    5.  **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env` to prevent accidental commits.
    6. **Configure Environment Variables for Build:** If your *build process* needs access to secrets (e.g., to fetch data from an API), configure those environment variables in your build environment (e.g., Netlify build settings, CI/CD environment variables).  This is distinct from deployment environment variables.
    7.  **Secrets Management Solution (Optional):** For more complex setups, consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    8. **Regularly audit code:** Check codebase for accidentally committed secrets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in the source code repository.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to your application or services (during build or deployment) using exposed credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Eliminates the risk of exposing credentials in the source code.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `.gitignore` includes `.env`.
    *   Some environment variables are used for deployment configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not all sensitive data is consistently managed using environment variables.  Some configuration files might still contain hardcoded values.
    *   Environment variables are not consistently used for the *build* process where needed.
    *   A secrets management solution is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `config.rb` and Helpers](./mitigation_strategies/secure__config_rb__and_helpers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `config.rb`:** Carefully examine the `config.rb` file for any potential security misconfigurations.
    2.  **`http_prefix`:** Ensure `http_prefix` is correctly set for your deployment environment to prevent asset path issues.
    3.  **Custom Helpers:**
        *   Identify all custom helpers.
        *   Review each helper's code for potential vulnerabilities (XSS, code injection).
        *   Sanitize any user-provided input used within helpers.
        *   Use appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `h`, `escape_html`).
    4.  **Third-Party Extensions:**
        *   List all installed Middleman extensions.
        *   Research each extension's security track record and maintenance status.
        *   Review the extension's source code if possible.
        *   Consider removing unused or unmaintained extensions.
    5. **Avoid inline Javascript and CSS:**
        * Use external files for Javascript and CSS.
        * If inline is necessary, make sure that all data is properly escaped.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Severity: Medium-High):** Misconfigured `http_prefix` or vulnerable custom helpers can lead to XSS.
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: High):** Vulnerable custom helpers could allow attackers to inject malicious code (especially if helpers are used to process data during build).
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low-Medium):** Misconfigurations might expose internal details of the application.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions (Severity: Varies):** Third-party extensions could introduce their own security flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, Code Injection:** Reduces the risk of these vulnerabilities by ensuring proper configuration and secure coding practices.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Minimizes the risk of unintentional information disclosure.
    *   **Extension Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party extensions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `config.rb` configuration is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough security review of `config.rb` and custom helpers has not been performed.
    *   No formal process for vetting third-party extensions.
    *   Inline Javascript and CSS are not always avoided.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Escape Template Output](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_escape_template_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input Sources:** Determine all possible sources of user input (e.g., forms, URL parameters, cookies, data loaded during build).  Even if your site is "static," data loaded during the build process could be a source of untrusted input.
    2.  **Use Escaping Helpers:** In your Middleman templates, use the appropriate escaping helpers for the context:
        *   `<%= h(user_input) %>` or `<%= escape_html(user_input) %>` for HTML output.
        *   Use other escaping helpers as needed for JavaScript, CSS, or URL contexts.
    3.  **Avoid `raw` and `==`:** Do not use `raw` or `==` to output user-provided data (or data from external sources during build) unless you are absolutely certain it is safe and have manually sanitized it.
    4.  **Sanitize Data Before Rendering:** If you need to perform more complex data manipulation, sanitize the data *before* passing it to the template.
    5.  **Test for XSS Vulnerabilities:** Use a web vulnerability scanner or manual testing to check for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Severity: Medium-High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into your website through user input (or data loaded during build).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some escaping is used in templates, but it's not consistently applied to all potentially untrusted data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of all templates to ensure consistent escaping is needed.
    *   No automated testing specifically for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Build Process (Middleman-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_build_process__middleman-specific_aspects_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Review Custom Build Scripts:** If you have any custom Middleman extensions, `after_build` hooks, or other custom build scripts (e.g., scripts that fetch data from external sources), carefully review them for potential security vulnerabilities.  This includes checking for:
        *   **Command Injection:** Ensure that external commands are executed safely, avoiding string interpolation with untrusted data.
        *   **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:** If your scripts read or write files, ensure that file paths are properly validated and sanitized.
        *   **Unsafe Data Handling:** If your scripts process data from external sources, ensure that the data is properly sanitized and validated.
    2. **Avoid Running as Root:** Never run `middleman build` with root privileges.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of Build Machine (Severity: Medium-High):** Reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to the machine where the build process runs *through vulnerabilities in custom build scripts*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: Medium):** If external resources fetched *during build* are compromised, secure handling of that data can limit the impact.
    * **Code Injection (Severity: High):** If custom build scripts are vulnerable.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Build Machine Compromise:** Reduces the potential impact of a compromised build process *due to vulnerabilities in Middleman-related code*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides some mitigation against supply chain attacks that affect the *build process*.
    * **Code Injection:** Prevents code injection via custom build scripts.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Build process runs on Netlify's build servers.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific review of custom build scripts (if any) for security vulnerabilities.
