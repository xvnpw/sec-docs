## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Middleman Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_middleman_version.md)

-   **Attack Vector:** Target applications running outdated Middleman versions with known security vulnerabilities (CVEs).
-   **Impact:** Full application compromise, potentially server access.
-   **Why High-Risk:**  Outdated software is a common vulnerability. Exploits for known CVEs are often publicly available, making exploitation relatively easy for attackers with low skill levels.
-   **Mitigation:**  Regularly update Middleman to the latest stable version. Implement vulnerability scanning to detect outdated versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleman Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleman_configuration_weaknesses.md)

-   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in `config.rb` or related files. This includes:
    -   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Accessing configuration files to extract API keys, secrets, or internal paths.
    -   **Misconfiguration Leading to Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging insecure configuration options that create vulnerabilities (e.g., overly permissive file access).
-   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access, potential for further exploitation depending on the misconfiguration.
-   **Why High-Risk:** Configuration errors are frequent in web applications.  Sensitive information in configuration files is a common target. Misconfigurations can directly lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
-   **Mitigation:** Secure configuration management practices: externalize secrets, restrict access to configuration files, regularly review configuration, follow security best practices for Middleman configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleman Extensions/Plugins - Vulnerable Extension Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleman_extensionsplugins_-_vulnerable_extension_code.md)

-   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the code of Middleman extensions (gems). This includes both known vulnerabilities and zero-day vulnerabilities in extensions.
-   **Impact:** Medium to High, depending on the vulnerability type (XSS, RCE, Path Traversal, etc.) and the extension's functionality.
-   **Why High-Risk:** Extensions are often developed by third parties and may have varying levels of security rigor. Vulnerabilities in popular extensions can affect many applications.
-   **Mitigation:**  Carefully select extensions from reputable sources, conduct security reviews of extensions, use dependency scanning to detect vulnerable extensions, and regularly update extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleman Build Process - Build Script Manipulation (If Custom Scripts Used)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleman_build_process_-_build_script_manipulation__if_custom_scripts_used_.md)

-   **Attack Vector:**  If custom build scripts (e.g., Rake tasks, shell scripts) are used in the Middleman project, attackers can attempt to:
    -   Identify these scripts (often in the project repository).
    -   Inject malicious commands into the scripts.
-   **Impact:** Medium to High, can lead to site defacement, data theft, or compromise of the build environment.
-   **Why High-Risk:** Custom build scripts are often overlooked in security reviews. If not carefully written, they can be vulnerable to command injection or other attacks. Compromising the build process can have a wide impact.
-   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly review custom build scripts for vulnerabilities, sanitize inputs in scripts, implement secure build environment practices, and monitor build script changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruby Dependencies (Used by Middleman)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ruby_dependencies__used_by_middleman_.md)

-   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems that Middleman or its extensions depend on.
-   **Impact:** Medium to High, depending on the vulnerability type in the dependency (DoS, RCE, etc.).
-   **Why High-Risk:** The Ruby ecosystem has a large number of gems, and vulnerabilities are frequently discovered. Middleman applications rely on these dependencies, creating a potential attack surface.
-   **Mitigation:**  Regularly scan `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities in Ruby gem dependencies using vulnerability scanners. Keep Ruby gem dependencies updated.
