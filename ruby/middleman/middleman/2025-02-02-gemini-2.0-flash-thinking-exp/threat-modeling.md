# Threat Model Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Threat: [Malicious Development Dependencies](./threats/malicious_development_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces malicious code through compromised or intentionally malicious Ruby gems listed as development dependencies in `Gemfile`. This code could execute during development or build processes, potentially stealing credentials, modifying code, or injecting backdoors.
**Impact:** Supply chain attack, compromised development environment, potential for malicious code in the generated static site, data breach.
**Middleman Component Affected:** Gem Management (Bundler), Dependency Loading.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and audit development dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit).
*   Pin gem versions in `Gemfile.lock`.
*   Use reputable gem sources and consider using private gem repositories.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Middleman Core](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_middleman_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the Middleman core codebase. This could lead to various attacks depending on the vulnerability, such as remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS) in generated content (less likely in static sites but possible through build process manipulation), or denial of service.
**Impact:** Site compromise, potential data breach, denial of service, reputational damage.
**Middleman Component Affected:** Middleman Core.
**Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerability is critical), Medium (if vulnerability is less severe) - *Included as potentially critical*
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Middleman updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor Middleman security advisories and release notes.
*   Implement a security vulnerability scanning process for dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Middleman Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_middleman_extensions.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in third-party or custom Middleman extensions. Extensions can have broad access and vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, information disclosure, or manipulation of the build process.
**Impact:** Site compromise, potential data breach, malicious modifications to the generated site, denial of service.
**Middleman Component Affected:** Middleman Extensions, Extension Loading Mechanism.
**Risk Severity:** High (depending on extension vulnerability and privileges), Medium (if extension is less critical) - *Included as potentially critical*
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate and audit extensions before use.
*   Choose extensions from reputable sources with active maintenance.
*   Review extension code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Keep extensions updated to their latest versions.
*   Implement security scanning for extensions if possible.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Configuration Files](./threats/code_injection_through_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** If Middleman configuration files are dynamically generated or influenced by untrusted external data, an attacker could inject malicious code into these files. This code could then be executed during the build process, leading to site compromise or malicious modifications.
**Impact:** Remote code execution during build process, potential for malicious code in the generated site, site compromise.
**Middleman Component Affected:** Configuration Loading, Data Processing.
**Risk Severity:** High (if configuration files are dynamically generated from untrusted sources), Low (if configuration is static and controlled) - *Included as potentially critical if dynamic configuration is used*
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat configuration files as code and manage them securely.
*   Avoid dynamically generating configuration files based on untrusted input.
*   Sanitize and validate any external data used in the build process.
*   Implement code review for configuration changes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Ruby Gem Dependencies (Runtime)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ruby_gem_dependencies__runtime_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Ruby gems that Middleman depends on at runtime (even in the generated static site context if dynamic elements are introduced via extensions or build process). This could lead to various attacks depending on the vulnerability, even in a static site context if dynamic elements are present.
**Impact:** Site compromise, potential data breach, denial of service, reputational damage.
**Middleman Component Affected:** Gem Dependencies, Runtime Environment (if applicable).
**Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerability is critical), Medium (if vulnerability is less severe) - *Included as potentially critical*
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Middleman and its dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit).
*   Monitor security advisories for Ruby gems.
*   Pin gem versions in `Gemfile.lock` and update dependencies in a controlled manner.
