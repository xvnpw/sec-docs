# Attack Surface Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information within Middleman configuration files (e.g., `config.rb`, data files) is unintentionally made publicly accessible in the deployed static site.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman relies on configuration files for site settings and data. Misconfiguration during deployment or web server setup can lead to these files being served as static assets.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally includes `config.rb` in the `source` directory, and it gets copied to the `build` directory and served by the web server. This file contains API keys for external services.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords), internal paths, and application secrets, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further system exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly exclude configuration files from the `source` directory and the build output. Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms.
    *   Store sensitive configuration outside of the application codebase using environment variables or secure vault systems.
    *   Implement proper web server configuration to prevent direct access to configuration files.
    *   Regularly audit deployed files to ensure no configuration files are inadvertently exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Options (Debug/Verbose Logging)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_options__debugverbose_logging_.md)

*   **Description:** Enabling debug or verbose logging in production environments exposes internal application details and potentially sensitive data in logs or error messages.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman offers debug and verbose logging options for development. Leaving these enabled in production increases information leakage.
*   **Example:**  `config.rb` has a `configure :development do` block with verbose logging enabled, and this configuration is mistakenly deployed to production. Error messages now reveal internal file paths and gem versions to attackers.
*   **Impact:** Information leakage about server paths, Ruby environment, and potentially sensitive data processed during build, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable debug and verbose logging in production environments. Set logging levels appropriately for production (e.g., `warn` or `error`).
    *   Implement proper error handling and logging practices, avoiding exposure of sensitive information in error messages.
    *   Review and sanitize logs regularly to ensure no sensitive information is being inadvertently logged.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Compromise (Dependency Vulnerabilities/Malicious Packages)](./attack_surfaces/build_process_compromise__dependency_vulnerabilitiesmalicious_packages_.md)

*   **Description:** The build process is compromised through vulnerable or malicious dependencies, leading to the injection of malicious content into the generated static site.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman relies on Ruby gems defined in `Gemfile`. Vulnerabilities in these gems or the introduction of malicious gems during dependency resolution can compromise the build.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered in a gem used by Middleman (e.g., a Markdown parser). An attacker exploits this vulnerability during the build process to inject malicious JavaScript into the generated HTML files.
*   **Impact:** Injection of malicious code (XSS, redirects, backdoors) into the static site, potentially leading to user compromise, data theft, or site defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies (gems) listed in `Gemfile` using tools like `bundle audit`.
    *   Implement dependency pinning in `Gemfile.lock` for consistent builds.
    *   Use a reputable gem source (e.g., rubygems.org) and consider a private gem repository.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in CI/CD to scan for dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded gems using checksums or signatures.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Using untrusted or poorly maintained Middleman extensions (gems) introduces vulnerabilities or malicious code into the application.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman's extensibility through gems allows for adding features, but also introduces risk if extensions are not vetted.
*   **Example:** A developer uses a community-contributed Middleman extension for image optimization. This extension contains a vulnerability that allows remote code execution when processing certain image files during the build process.
*   **Impact:** Security vulnerabilities within the extension can be exploited, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. Malicious extensions could intentionally inject backdoors or steal data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit all Middleman extensions before use, choosing extensions from trusted sources.
    *   Minimize the number of extensions used to only those strictly necessary.
    *   Keep extensions updated to the latest versions and monitor for security updates.
    *   Consider contributing to or forking and maintaining critical but unmaintained extensions.
    *   Implement security testing and code reviews for custom or less-known extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Helper Functions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_helper_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Custom helper functions written in Ruby contain security vulnerabilities, such as XSS or insecure operations.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman allows developers to create custom helper functions to extend template functionality. Poorly written helpers can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A helper function directly outputs user-provided data from a data file into HTML without proper escaping, leading to an XSS vulnerability when the generated page is viewed.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, information leakage, or other security issues depending on the nature of the insecure helper function.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply secure coding practices when writing helper functions, especially sanitizing and escaping user-provided data.
    *   Avoid performing sensitive operations or exposing sensitive information in helper functions.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of custom helper functions.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing helper functions.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Data Files](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_data_files.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted data in data files (YAML, JSON, CSV) used by Middleman can lead to content injection or denial of service during the build process.
*   **Middleman Contribution:** Middleman uses data files as a source of content. If these files are sourced from untrusted locations or dynamically generated, they become an injection point.
*   **Example:** A data file (e.g., `data/users.yml`) is populated from an external, potentially compromised API. This data file contains malicious HTML code that is then rendered by Middleman into the static site, resulting in XSS.
*   **Impact:** Content injection (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS) if malicious data causes excessive resource consumption during build, or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate data from external sources before using it in Middleman.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for data files to ensure data conforms to expected formats and is safe.
    *   Limit the size and complexity of data files to prevent DoS attacks during build.
    *   Prefer static data files under version control and review them for malicious content.
