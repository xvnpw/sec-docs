## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Middleman's Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_middleman's_build_process.md)

This path encompasses several related attack vectors that target the application during its build phase. Success in this area often grants the attacker significant control over the final output and potentially the environment where the build occurs.

*   **Inject Malicious Code During Build:**
    *   **Compromise Source Files (AND):** This involves gaining unauthorized access to the source code repository or the development environment to directly modify files.
        *   **Direct Modification of Template Files [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker directly alters template files (e.g., HTML, Markdown) to inject malicious scripts or content. This is a critical node because it allows for immediate and direct control over the website's presentation and user interactions.
    *   **Manipulate Build Configuration (AND):** This focuses on altering the Middleman configuration to influence the build process.
        *   **Modify `config.rb` [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker modifies the `config.rb` file, which is a Ruby script. This allows for the injection of arbitrary Ruby code that will be executed during the build, potentially leading to full control over the build process and the ability to introduce further vulnerabilities.
        *   **Modify `.ruby-version` or `Gemfile` (to introduce vulnerable dependencies):**  An attacker modifies the files that define the Ruby version and the project's dependencies. This allows them to force the inclusion of specific, known-vulnerable versions of libraries (gems) or entirely malicious dependencies, which can then be exploited.

*   **Introduce Vulnerabilities via Dependencies (AND) [CRITICAL]:** This path focuses on leveraging the external libraries (gems) that Middleman relies on.
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Gems:**  Attackers exploit publicly known security flaws in the gems used by the Middleman project. This often involves using readily available exploits.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on a Dependency [CRITICAL]:** A more sophisticated attack where an attacker compromises a legitimate dependency (a gem) and injects malicious code into it. This can have widespread impact as many projects might use the compromised dependency. This is critical due to the potential for widespread impact and the difficulty of detection.
    *   **Introduce Malicious Gems [CRITICAL]:**  Attackers trick developers into including a completely malicious gem in their project. This gem is designed to harm the application during the build process or at runtime. This is critical as the malicious gem has full control within the application's context.

*   **Exploit Middleman's Extension Mechanism (AND) [CRITICAL]:** Middleman allows for extending its functionality through extensions. This path focuses on exploiting this mechanism.
    *   **Develop and Introduce a Malicious Extension [CRITICAL]:** An attacker creates a seemingly benign but actually malicious Middleman extension and convinces the developers to install it. This extension can then execute arbitrary code during the build process. This is critical due to the direct control the extension has over the build process.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Existing Extensions [CRITICAL]:** Attackers find and exploit security vulnerabilities in already installed Middleman extensions. This allows them to leverage the extension's privileges to compromise the application. This is critical because it leverages existing trust and code within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Generated Static Site (Indirectly via Middleman's Output)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_generated_static_site__indirectly_via_middleman's_outp_e9a8c9c4.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities present in the final static website generated by Middleman.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (AND):** This involves injecting malicious scripts into the website's content, which are then executed by users' browsers.
    *   **Inject malicious scripts through data sources processed by Middleman:** Attackers manipulate data sources (like YAML files or databases) that Middleman uses to generate the website's content. By injecting malicious scripts into these data sources, the generated HTML will contain the scripts, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection (if used) (AND) [CRITICAL]:** If the web server hosting the static site is configured to process Server-Side Includes (SSI), attackers can inject malicious SSI directives into the content.
    *   **Inject malicious SSI directives through data sources:** Similar to XSS, attackers inject SSI directives into data sources. If the server processes these directives, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server itself. This is a critical node because it can lead to full server compromise.
