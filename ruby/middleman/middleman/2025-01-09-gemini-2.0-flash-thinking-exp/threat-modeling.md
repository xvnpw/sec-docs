# Threat Model Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers could inject malicious code into template files (e.g., ERB, Haml) by manipulating data that gets incorporated into the template rendering process *handled by Middleman*. This could involve modifying data source files or exploiting vulnerabilities in user-provided content used within templates that *Middleman processes*. The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server during the build process *managed by Middleman*.

**Impact:**  Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, modify files, install malware, or pivot to other systems. The generated static site could also be compromised with malicious scripts.

**Affected Component:** Templating Engines (ERB, Haml, Slim) *integrated with Middleman*, `Tilt` abstraction layer *used by Middleman* for template rendering. Specifically, the methods *within Middleman* responsible for evaluating and rendering template code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly embedding user-provided data or external data directly into templates without thorough sanitization and escaping *before Middleman processes them*.
*   Utilize templating engine features designed for safe data interpolation and avoid using `eval` or similar dynamic code execution within templates *that Middleman interprets*.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data that influences template rendering *within Middleman's scope*.
*   Regularly review template code for potential injection vulnerabilities *in the context of Middleman's rendering*.

## Threat: [Data Source Poisoning](./threats/data_source_poisoning.md)

**Description:** Attackers could inject malicious content into data source files (YAML, JSON, CSV) that *Middleman uses* to populate the website content. This could be achieved by compromising the storage location of these files or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that generate these data files. *Middleman would then process* this malicious data, potentially leading to the injection of harmful scripts into the generated static site or causing unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated static site, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers. This could result in session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. It could also lead to website defacement or incorrect information being displayed.

**Affected Component:** Data loading mechanisms *within Middleman*, specifically the `data` helper and the modules *Middleman uses* for parsing YAML, JSON, and CSV files (e.g., `Psych`, `JSON`, `CSV`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the storage location of data source files with appropriate file system permissions and access controls.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) for data source files to detect unauthorized modifications *before Middleman reads them*.
*   Validate and sanitize data read from external sources *before Middleman uses it* in the application.
*   Restrict write access to data source files to authorized users and processes only.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the `config.rb` file could modify *Middleman's* configuration settings. This could involve changing build paths, adding malicious code to the build process, or altering how assets are handled *by Middleman*. The attacker could potentially inject arbitrary code that executes during the build process *managed by Middleman* or manipulate the output of the static site.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise. Manipulation of the generated static site, including injecting malicious scripts or redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites.

**Affected Component:** The `Middleman::Configuration` module and the loading and processing of the `config.rb` file *by Middleman*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Protect the `config.rb` file with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to authorized users only.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the `config.rb` file; use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
*   Implement monitoring for changes to the `config.rb` file.

## Threat: [Malicious Helper/Extension](./threats/malicious_helperextension.md)

**Description:** If an attacker can introduce a malicious helper or extension (gem) into the Middleman project, *Middleman will execute* this code during the build process. This could be achieved by compromising the developer's environment, exploiting vulnerabilities in dependency management, or through social engineering. The malicious code could perform any action the build process *under Middleman's control* has permissions for.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise, data theft, or the injection of malicious content into the generated static site.

**Affected Component:** The helper loading mechanism *within Middleman*, the `helpers` module, and the RubyGems system *as used by Middleman*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet all third-party helpers and extensions before using them. Review their source code and security practices.
*   Keep all dependencies (including gems) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency management tools with security scanning capabilities to identify and mitigate vulnerable dependencies.
*   Implement a process for regularly reviewing and auditing the project's dependencies.

## Threat: [Build Process Manipulation](./threats/build_process_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to manipulate the build process *orchestrated by Middleman*. This could involve modifying build scripts that *Middleman interacts with*, injecting malicious commands into the build pipeline, or altering the dependencies required for the build *that Middleman relies on*. This could lead to the generation of compromised static files without directly modifying the source content.

**Impact:**  The generated static site could be compromised with malicious scripts or content, leading to XSS vulnerabilities or other attacks against website users. The build environment itself could be compromised.

**Affected Component:** The Middleman build pipeline, including rake tasks and any custom build scripts *integrated with Middleman*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the environment where the build process runs, limiting access to authorized users and processes.
*   Implement integrity checks for build scripts and dependencies to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Use a controlled and isolated build environment to minimize the impact of potential compromises.
*   Implement version control for build scripts and track changes.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Gems](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_gems.md)

**Description:**  Malicious actors could compromise legitimate Ruby gems used by the Middleman application, injecting malicious code that gets executed *when Middleman uses* these gems during the build process. This could happen through various means, such as compromising gem maintainer accounts or exploiting vulnerabilities in the gem publishing process.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise, data theft, or the injection of malicious content into the generated static site.

**Affected Component:** The RubyGems system, the dependency management system (Bundler), and the gem loading mechanism *within Middleman*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use trusted gem sources and verify the integrity of downloaded gems.
*   Implement dependency pinning to ensure consistent versions and prevent unexpected updates.
*   Employ security scanning tools that analyze gem dependencies for known vulnerabilities and potential malicious code.
*   Consider using private gem repositories for internal dependencies.
*   Regularly audit the project's dependencies and their maintainers.
