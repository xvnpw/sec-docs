# Attack Surface Analysis for middleman/middleman

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template directives that are then executed on the server during the build process.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman utilizes templating engines (ERB, Haml, Slim) and allows embedding dynamic content within templates. If user-provided data is directly inserted into templates without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written helper function takes user input and directly embeds it into an ERB template: `<%= params[:name] %>`. An attacker could provide `"><script>alert('XSS')</script><%="" %>` as the `name` parameter, potentially executing arbitrary code during the build or in the generated HTML.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise, data exfiltration, or defacement of the generated website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize User Input: Always sanitize or escape user-provided data before embedding it into templates. Use appropriate escaping methods provided by the templating engine.
        *   Avoid Direct Embedding of Untrusted Data:  Minimize the direct inclusion of user input in templates. If necessary, process and validate the data thoroughly before use.
        *   Use Secure Templating Practices: Adhere to secure coding practices for the chosen templating engine.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Middleman extensions contain malicious code or security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman's extension system allows developers to add custom functionality. Installing extensions from untrusted sources or using extensions with known vulnerabilities introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** A malicious extension could be designed to inject malicious scripts into every generated HTML page or to exfiltrate sensitive data during the build process. A vulnerable extension might have a flaw that allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary code execution during the build.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the generated website, data theft, server compromise during the build process, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Vet Extensions Carefully: Only install extensions from trusted and reputable sources. Review the extension's code if possible.
        *   Keep Extensions Updated: Regularly update extensions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use Dependency Checkers: Employ tools that scan your project's dependencies (including extensions) for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: If possible, run the Middleman build process with limited privileges to reduce the impact of a compromised extension.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, or internal paths are inadvertently exposed in Middleman's configuration files.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman uses a `config.rb` file to store configuration settings. Developers might mistakenly include sensitive information directly in this file.
    *   **Example:** The `config.rb` file contains an API key for a third-party service: `config[:api_key] = "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY"`. If this file is exposed through a misconfigured Git repository or a compromised server, the API key can be misused.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or compromise of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Environment Variables: Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of directly in configuration files. Access these variables within your Middleman application.
        *   Secure Configuration Management: Utilize secure configuration management tools or services to handle sensitive data.
        *   Restrict Access to Configuration Files: Ensure that access to configuration files is properly restricted in your version control system and on your servers.
        *   Avoid Committing Secrets: Never commit sensitive information directly to your version control repository.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via External Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_external_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious commands that are executed by the server during the build process through Middleman's functionalities that interact with the operating system.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman, through helpers or extensions, might execute external commands based on user input or configuration. If this input is not properly sanitized, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** A helper function uses user-provided input to construct a shell command: `system("convert image.png -resize #{params[:size]} output.png")`. An attacker could provide a malicious value for `size` like `100x100; rm -rf /`, potentially deleting critical files on the server during the build.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server during the build process, potentially leading to server compromise, data loss, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Executing External Commands with User Input:  Minimize the use of external commands, especially when incorporating user-provided data.
        *   Sanitize Input for External Commands: If executing external commands is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input to prevent command injection. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives if available.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run the Middleman build process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided as input to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Middleman Contributes:** Middleman or its extensions might process user-provided file paths for tasks like including partials or accessing assets. If these paths are not properly validated, it can lead to path traversal.
    *   **Example:** A helper function takes a filename as input and includes it: `partial params[:template]`. An attacker could provide a value like `../../../../etc/passwd` for `template`, potentially exposing sensitive system files during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive files, or potentially overwriting critical files if write access is involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and Sanitize File Paths:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided file paths to ensure they are within the expected directory structure.
        *   Avoid Direct File Path Manipulation: If possible, avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Use whitelisting or predefined options instead.
        *   Restrict File System Access: Ensure the Middleman process runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
