# Threat Model Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation and Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation_and_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (or exploiting a vulnerability in Foreman's plugin management) installs a malicious Foreman plugin. This plugin, running within the Foreman environment, could perform various malicious actions such as exfiltrating data from Foreman's database, manipulating Foreman's internal state, or even executing arbitrary code on the Foreman server itself. The vulnerability lies in Foreman's plugin management system allowing the installation and execution of untrusted code.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Foreman server, potential exposure of sensitive infrastructure data, and the ability to further compromise managed hosts through Foreman's functionalities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Foreman's Plugin Management system, potentially all Foreman modules due to the plugin's ability to interact with the core application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict plugin whitelisting and only allow installation of trusted plugins from verified and auditable sources.
        *   Implement code signing and verification mechanisms for plugins to ensure their integrity and origin.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and their associated permissions.
        *   Isolate plugin execution environments using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
        *   Restrict plugin installation privileges to a limited set of trusted administrators.

## Threat: [Foreman API Request Spoofing without Proper Authentication](./threats/foreman_api_request_spoofing_without_proper_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Foreman's API authentication and authorization mechanisms to send spoofed requests. By impersonating legitimate users or systems, the attacker can perform unauthorized actions directly through the Foreman API, such as provisioning or deprovisioning hosts, modifying configurations stored within Foreman, or retrieving sensitive data managed by Foreman. This threat directly targets vulnerabilities in Foreman's API implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to and manipulation of the managed infrastructure state as represented within Foreman, potential data breaches involving sensitive configuration data or credentials managed by Foreman, and service disruption through unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Foreman's API endpoints, Authentication and Authorization modules within the API implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication for all API requests, such as requiring API keys, OAuth 2.0 tokens, or other robust authentication methods.
        *   Implement granular authorization checks to ensure users or systems accessing the API only have permissions for the specific actions they are authorized to perform.
        *   Mandate the use of HTTPS for all API communication to prevent interception of authentication credentials and sensitive data.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious or unauthorized activity.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks on authentication mechanisms.

## Threat: [Tampering with Host Configuration Data in Foreman](./threats/tampering_with_host_configuration_data_in_foreman.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Foreman's internal data stores (e.g., the database) or configuration files and directly modifies the configuration data related to managed hosts. This tampering occurs within Foreman itself, altering the intended state of the infrastructure as managed by Foreman. This could lead to the deployment of insecure configurations, the misconfiguration of services, or the introduction of malicious settings through Foreman's management capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of managed hosts due to the deployment of tampered configurations orchestrated by Foreman, potential data breaches if the tampered configurations expose sensitive information, and service disruption caused by misconfigurations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Foreman's Database, Host Configuration Management modules responsible for storing and applying configuration data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls for the Foreman server, its database, and configuration files, restricting access to authorized personnel and systems only.
        *   Use encryption for sensitive data at rest within Foreman's data stores.
        *   Regularly back up Foreman's data to enable recovery from unauthorized modifications.
        *   Implement integrity checks and auditing mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to configuration data within Foreman.
        *   Consider using version control for configuration data within Foreman to track changes and facilitate rollback.
