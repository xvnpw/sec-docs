# Attack Surface Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection (ERB)](./attack_surfaces/template_injection__erb_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Foreman templates, primarily used for provisioning and configuration management.

*   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman utilizes ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating, allowing dynamic content generation. If user-supplied data or insufficiently sanitized data is included in templates, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Foreman server.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a provisioning template that executes system commands when rendered by Foreman, potentially granting them shell access to the server.
*   **Impact:**  Critical - Full compromise of the Foreman server, potentially leading to control over the entire managed infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize all user-provided data used in templates.
    *   Implement a secure template review process.
    *   Utilize features or plugins that offer sandboxing or restricted template execution environments.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the Foreman user running the template rendering process.
    *   Regularly update Foreman to patch known template injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Smart Proxy Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_smart_proxy_communication.md)

**Description:**  Communication between the Foreman server and Smart Proxies is not adequately secured, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks or eavesdropping.

*   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman relies on Smart Proxies to perform actions on managed infrastructure. If this communication is not encrypted or authenticated, attackers can intercept credentials or inject malicious commands.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between Foreman and a Smart Proxy, stealing credentials used for managing hosts or injecting malicious commands to be executed on managed servers.
*   **Impact:** High - Compromise of managed hosts and potential access to sensitive data within the managed environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for communication between Foreman and Smart Proxies.
    *   Utilize strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., certificates) for Smart Proxy connections.
    *   Regularly rotate Smart Proxy certificates.
    *   Restrict network access to Smart Proxies to authorized Foreman servers.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Foreman's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions.

*   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman exposes a powerful API for automation and integration. Flaws in how this API authenticates and authorizes requests can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API to create, modify, or delete resources (e.g., hosts, users) without proper authentication, potentially disrupting services or gaining administrative control.
*   **Impact:** High - Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation, and disruption of services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication for all API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Implement robust authorization checks based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly review and audit API access controls.
    *   Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks against API credentials.
    *   Keep Foreman updated to patch known API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Execution without Proper Authorization](./attack_surfaces/remote_execution_without_proper_authorization.md)

**Description:**  Foreman's remote execution features (e.g., through Hammer CLI or the API) allow users to execute commands on managed hosts without sufficient authorization checks.

*   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman provides functionality to remotely execute commands for management purposes. If authorization is not properly enforced, lower-privileged users could potentially execute commands they shouldn't.
*   **Example:** A user with limited privileges in Foreman is able to execute commands on a critical production server, leading to system disruption or data compromise.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential for system disruption, data compromise, or privilege escalation on managed hosts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) for remote execution features.
    *   Ensure that only authorized users and roles can execute commands on specific hosts or host groups.
    *   Log and audit all remote execution attempts.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for remote commands to prevent command injection.
