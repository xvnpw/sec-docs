## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Foreman (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_foreman__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to the application's resources or data by exploiting weaknesses in the integrated Foreman instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This category represents attacks that aim to bypass or subvert Foreman's mechanisms for verifying user identity and controlling access to resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Foreman Authentication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_foreman_authentication__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to gain access to Foreman without providing valid credentials or by circumventing the authentication process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Foreman Authentication Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_foreman_authentication_vulnerabilities__e_g___cves___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers research publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in Foreman's authentication mechanisms.
*   They develop or utilize existing exploits to leverage these vulnerabilities, potentially allowing them to log in as legitimate users or gain administrative access without proper credentials.
*   Examples include exploiting SQL injection flaws in login forms, authentication bypass vulnerabilities in specific API endpoints, or flaws in session management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman Authorization Flaws (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman_authorization_flaws__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to gain access to resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to perform, even if they have successfully authenticated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation within Foreman (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation_within_foreman__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow a user with limited privileges within Foreman to gain higher levels of access, potentially reaching administrative privileges.
*   This could involve exploiting flaws in role-based access control (RBAC), insecure API endpoints that allow privilege modification, or vulnerabilities in Foreman's internal logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman Data Management Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman_data_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category involves attacks that target the data managed by Foreman, which can directly impact the application's infrastructure and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Host Configurations via Foreman (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_host_configurations_via_foreman__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers, having gained sufficient access to Foreman, utilize its features to alter the configurations of servers managed by Foreman.
*   This could involve changing network settings, installing malicious software, modifying security policies, or disabling critical services on application servers, leading to disruption or compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Provisioning Templates (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_provisioning_templates__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers modify the templates used by Foreman to automatically provision new servers or configure existing ones.
*   By injecting malicious code or configurations into these templates, attackers can ensure that newly deployed application instances are already compromised or contain backdoors, leading to persistent compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Application Secrets Stored in Foreman (e.g., Ansible Vault) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/access_application_secrets_stored_in_foreman__e_g___ansible_vault___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Foreman is often used to manage sensitive application secrets, such as database credentials or API keys, often stored securely using tools like Ansible Vault.
*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Foreman or its integration with secret management tools to gain access to these sensitive credentials. This allows them to directly compromise the application or other related systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman Provisioning and Orchestration Features (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman_provisioning_and_orchestration_features__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that leverage Foreman's automation capabilities to introduce malicious elements into the application's infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Provisioning Scripts/Templates (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_provisioning_scriptstemplates__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into scripts or templates used by Foreman for provisioning application infrastructure. This ensures that newly deployed systems are compromised from the start.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands via Foreman's Remote Execution Features (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_via_foreman's_remote_execution_features__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Foreman's remote execution capabilities (e.g., using SSH or Ansible) to run arbitrary commands on servers managed by Foreman.
*   This allows them to directly control application servers, install malware, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Foreman API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_foreman_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category involves attacks that target the Foreman Application Programming Interface (API), which is used for programmatic interaction with Foreman.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Plugin Installation Process (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_plugin_installation_process__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers manipulate the process of installing plugins or extensions into Foreman.
*   This could involve compromising the plugin repository, intercepting the download process, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin installation mechanism to introduce malicious plugins. These malicious plugins can then execute arbitrary code within Foreman, potentially leading to full system compromise and impacting the application.
