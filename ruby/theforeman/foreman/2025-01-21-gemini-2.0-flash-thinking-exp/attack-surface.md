# Attack Surface Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Authentication Bypass
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's reliance on specific authentication mechanisms (local, external, Katello integration) can introduce vulnerabilities if these mechanisms are not securely implemented or configured.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Foreman's LDAP authentication integration to bypass login credentials and gain unauthorized access to the Foreman web interface.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the Foreman instance, allowing attackers to manage infrastructure, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise managed hosts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for local Foreman users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Foreman users.
        *   Regularly update Foreman and any authentication-related plugins or gems.
        *   Securely configure external authentication providers (LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Authorization Flaws
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's role-based access control (RBAC) system, if not correctly configured or containing vulnerabilities, can allow users to perform actions beyond their intended privileges.
    *   **Example:** A user with limited permissions being able to modify provisioning templates or access sensitive host information due to misconfigured RBAC rules.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, potential for data breaches, and the ability to disrupt or compromise managed infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and implement Foreman's RBAC policies, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations to ensure they are still appropriate.
        *   Test RBAC configurations thoroughly to identify potential bypasses.
        *   Educate users on their assigned roles and responsibilities.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Remote Execution](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_remote_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Command Injection via Remote Execution
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's features for remote execution on managed hosts (e.g., running scripts, Puppet runs) can be vulnerable if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injecting malicious commands into a provisioning template or a custom fact that gets executed on a managed host.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the targeted managed host, allowing for data exfiltration, malware installation, or further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data used in remote execution commands.
        *   Use parameterized commands or secure templating engines to prevent command injection.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Foreman users who can initiate remote execution.
        *   Regularly audit provisioning templates and custom facts for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's interactions with external services (e.g., fetching provisioning templates from URLs, communicating with cloud providers) can be exploited if an attacker can control the destination URL.
    *   **Example:** An attacker providing a malicious URL for a provisioning template, causing the Foreman server to make requests to internal network resources or external services on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, potential for information disclosure, and the ability to leverage the Foreman server as a proxy for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs used by Foreman.
        *   Use allow-lists for allowed destination URLs instead of relying solely on block-lists.
        *   Restrict Foreman's network access to only necessary external resources.
        *   Monitor Foreman's outbound network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/insecure_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure Plugin Vulnerabilities
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but vulnerabilities in third-party plugins can introduce security risks to the Foreman instance.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Foreman server or gain access to sensitive data managed by the plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Foreman instance, potential access to managed infrastructure, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all installed plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly review the security posture of installed plugins.
        *   Consider using plugin vulnerability scanning tools if available.
        *   Disable or remove unused plugins.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** API Key Compromise
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman's API allows for programmatic interaction, and compromised API keys can grant attackers significant control over the Foreman instance and managed infrastructure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to a Foreman API key through a data breach or insecure storage, allowing them to create, modify, or delete resources via the API.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized management of infrastructure, potential for data breaches, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage Foreman API keys.
        *   Implement proper access controls for API key generation and usage.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication methods for API access where possible (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Credentials for Integrations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_credentials_for_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure Storage of Credentials for Integrations
    *   **How Foreman Contributes:** Foreman needs to store credentials for integrating with various systems (e.g., Puppet, Ansible, cloud providers). Insecure storage of these credentials can lead to their compromise.
    *   **Example:** Credentials for a cloud provider being stored in plain text in Foreman's database or configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of integrated systems, potentially leading to broader infrastructure breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Foreman's built-in secret management features or integrate with dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
        *   Encrypt sensitive credentials at rest.
        *   Implement strict access controls for accessing stored credentials.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials used for integrations.
