# Threat Model Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Threat: [Compromised Foreman Administrator Credentials](./threats/compromised_foreman_administrator_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Foreman administrator credentials through methods like phishing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where credentials are stored. They can then log into the Foreman web interface or use the API.

**Impact:** Full control over the Foreman instance, allowing the attacker to provision malicious infrastructure, modify configurations, deploy malicious patches, access sensitive data about managed hosts, and potentially disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** Foreman Core Authentication Module, Foreman Web UI, Foreman API

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Foreman user accounts.
*   Regularly review and rotate administrator credentials.
*   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
*   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.
*   Securely store Foreman credentials if used in automation scripts.

## Threat: [Malicious Provisioning Templates](./threats/malicious_provisioning_templates.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges modifies or injects malicious code into Foreman provisioning templates (e.g., using Puppet, Ansible, or custom scripts). When new servers are provisioned using these templates, the malicious code is executed.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised servers containing backdoors, malware, or insecure configurations. This could lead to data breaches, remote code execution, and further compromise of the infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Foreman Provisioning Modules (e.g., Puppet integration, Ansible integration, custom script execution)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control for modifying provisioning templates.
*   Use version control for provisioning templates and track changes.
*   Implement code review processes for template modifications.
*   Regularly scan provisioning templates for vulnerabilities and malicious code.
*   Use signed and verified templates where possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Management via Foreman](./threats/insecure_configuration_management_via_foreman.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Foreman's configuration management integrations (e.g., Puppet, Ansible) or gains unauthorized access to push malicious configurations to managed hosts.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of managed servers through malicious configuration changes, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or the introduction of vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Foreman Configuration Management Modules (e.g., Puppet integration, Ansible integration)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure communication channels between Foreman and configuration management agents.
*   Implement code review and testing processes for configuration changes.
*   Use signed and verified configuration modules.
*   Restrict access to configuration management functionalities within Foreman.
*   Monitor configuration changes for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Foreman Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_foreman_configuration.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or database credentials might be stored in plain text within Foreman's configuration files, database, or provisioning parameters. An attacker gaining access to Foreman's backend could retrieve this information.

**Impact:** Exposure of critical credentials, allowing attackers to compromise other systems and services integrated with the managed infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Foreman Core, Foreman Database, Provisioning Modules

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text within Foreman.
*   Utilize Foreman's features for managing secrets securely (if available).
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the Foreman database and configuration files.
*   Implement strict access control to Foreman's backend systems.

## Threat: [Malicious Patch Deployment via Foreman](./threats/malicious_patch_deployment_via_foreman.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of Foreman's patching mechanisms and deploys malicious patches or updates to managed servers.

**Impact:** Installation of compromised software on managed hosts, potentially leading to backdoors, malware infections, and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Foreman Patching Modules (e.g., integration with operating system package managers)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity and authenticity of patches before deployment.
*   Implement a controlled patch management process with testing and rollback capabilities.
*   Restrict access to patch management functionalities within Foreman.
*   Monitor patch deployment activities for anomalies.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities in Foreman](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_in_foreman.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in Foreman's API endpoints (e.g., authentication bypass, injection flaws, insecure direct object references). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Foreman functionalities, data breaches, manipulation of managed infrastructure, and potential service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Foreman API

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Foreman updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Implement proper input validation and sanitization for API requests.
*   Enforce authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
*   Regularly perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing) on the Foreman API.
