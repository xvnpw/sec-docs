# Threat Model Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Threat: [Rogue Smart Proxy Registration](./threats/rogue_smart_proxy_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully registers a malicious Smart Proxy with the Foreman server.  The attacker crafts a Smart Proxy that mimics legitimate behavior during registration but is designed to intercept, modify, or inject data into the Foreman communication flow. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the registration process or social engineering.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of managed hosts: The rogue proxy can push malicious configurations.
        *   Data exfiltration: Interception of sensitive data between Foreman and hosts.
        *   Denial of service: Disruption of communication.
        *   Man-in-the-middle attacks: Interception and modification of communications.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:**
        *   `Foreman Core`: Smart Proxy registration and management (`app/models/smart_proxy.rb`, related controllers/services).
        *   `Communication Channels`: HTTPS communication between Foreman and Smart Proxies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory mTLS:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for *all* Smart Proxy registrations. No registration without a valid, trusted client certificate.
        *   **Manual Approval:** Require explicit administrator approval for *all* new Smart Proxy registrations (human review).
        *   **Proxy Whitelisting:** Maintain and enforce a whitelist of authorized Smart Proxy hostnames/IPs.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Consider certificate pinning (with awareness of operational complexities).
        *   **Regular Auditing:** Frequent audits of registered Smart Proxies; investigate anomalies.

## Threat: [Template/Snippet Injection](./threats/templatesnippet_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Foreman (web interface or database) and modifies a provisioning template or snippet.  The attacker injects malicious code that will be executed on managed hosts during provisioning or configuration updates.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of newly provisioned hosts: Malicious code runs as part of provisioning.
        *   Data exfiltration: Injected code can steal data.
        *   Backdoor installation: Persistent access via injected code.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:**
        *   `Foreman Core`: Template/snippet management (`app/models/template.rb`, `app/models/snippet.rb`, controllers/views).
        *   `Provisioning Engine`: Code that renders and applies templates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control (RBAC):** Limit template/snippet modification to highly trusted users.
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** Prevent malicious code injection through strict input validation on template content. Use a templating language with built-in security (e.g., auto-escaping).
        *   **Version Control (Git):** Track changes, enable auditing, and allow rollbacks.
        *   **Mandatory Code Review:** Require code review for *all* template/snippet changes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict executable content within templates.

## Threat: [API Abuse](./threats/api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Foreman's API or uses stolen/compromised API credentials to perform unauthorized actions.  This includes creating, modifying, or deleting hosts, altering configurations, or accessing sensitive data exposed through the API.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Wide-ranging: Host compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, privilege escalation â€“ all depend on the specific API calls abused.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:**
        *   `Foreman Core`: API endpoints (`app/controllers/api/v2/*`, related models/services).
        *   `Authentication and Authorization`: Mechanisms controlling API access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Use robust authentication (API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks on the API.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation on *all* API requests.
        *   **Strict RBAC:** Restrict API access based on user roles via Foreman's RBAC.
        *   **API Documentation and Testing:** Maintain up-to-date documentation and regularly test the API for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Log all API requests/responses for auditing.
        *   **API Key Rotation:** Enforce regular rotation of API keys.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Foreman Plugin](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_foreman_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or vulnerable Foreman plugin allows an attacker to gain higher privileges within Foreman than intended.  The plugin might bypass Foreman's RBAC or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of Foreman server: Full control over the Foreman server.
        *   Compromise of managed hosts: Ability to use Foreman to compromise hosts.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:**
        *   `Foreman Core`: Plugin loading/management (`lib/foreman.rb`, `engines/*`).
        *   `Specific Plugin`: The vulnerable or malicious plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** *Strictly* vet all plugins before installation. Use only trusted sources.
        *   **Plugin Security Audits:** Regularly audit plugin code for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to patch vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure plugins to run with minimal necessary privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore sandboxing to limit plugin access.

## Threat: [Fact Tampering](./threats/fact_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker on a managed host modifies the facts reported to Foreman (e.g., through Facter for Puppet, or Ansible facts). False facts can lead to incorrect provisioning or configuration decisions, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect provisioning: Hosts may be provisioned with incorrect settings.
        *   Security vulnerabilities: Hosts may be configured insecurely due to false facts.
        *   Compliance violations.
    *   **Foreman Component Affected:**
        *   `Foreman Core`: Fact parsing and processing logic (`app/models/fact_value.rb`, related controllers and services).
        *   `Host Management`: Logic that uses facts to make decisions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fact Signing (if supported):** Utilize fact signing (e.g., signed facts in Puppet) to ensure integrity.
        *   **Trusted Fact Sources:** Configure Foreman to trust facts only from specific, verified sources.
        *   **Fact Validation:** Implement custom validation rules within Foreman to detect suspicious or inconsistent facts.
        *   **Host Hardening:** Implement security hardening on managed hosts to reduce the risk of tampering (though this is *indirectly* related to Foreman).
        *   **Regular Auditing:** Audit reported facts and investigate anomalies.
