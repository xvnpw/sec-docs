## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Template Management - Implement Template Scanning and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_template_management_-_implement_template_scanning_and_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Template Scanning and Validation

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose a Scanning Tool:** Select a suitable static analysis security testing (SAST) tool or vulnerability scanner capable of analyzing Foreman provisioning templates (e.g., `yamllint` with security rules, `ansible-lint` with security plugins, dedicated template security scanners if available).
        2.  **Integrate with Foreman Template Management:** Integrate the chosen scanning tool into your Foreman template management workflow. This could involve scripting the scan to run before template uploads or updates to Foreman, or ideally, integrating it into a CI/CD pipeline that manages Foreman templates.
        3.  **Configure Scanning Rules:** Configure the scanning tool with rules to detect:
            *   Hardcoded credentials (passwords, API keys, secrets) within Foreman templates (e.g., Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Salt code).
            *   Common misconfigurations relevant to systems provisioned by Foreman templates (e.g., overly permissive firewall rules, insecure service configurations within templates).
            *   Known vulnerabilities in template syntax or used modules/roles that Foreman utilizes for provisioning.
        4.  **Establish Thresholds and Failures:** Define acceptable vulnerability thresholds for template scans. Implement a process to reject template changes in Foreman if they fail security scans or exceed defined thresholds. This could be a manual review gate or automated rejection within your template management workflow.
        5.  **Remediation Workflow:** Establish a clear workflow for addressing identified vulnerabilities in Foreman templates. Developers or template administrators should be notified of scan failures and required to remediate issues within Foreman templates before they are used for provisioning.
        6.  **Regular Updates:** Keep the scanning tool and its rule sets updated to detect new vulnerabilities and misconfigurations relevant to Foreman templates and provisioning technologies.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure (High Severity):**  Attackers gaining access to Foreman templates with hardcoded credentials can compromise systems provisioned using those templates through Foreman.
        *   **Configuration Mismanagement in Provisioned Systems (Medium Severity):**  Insecure configurations within Foreman templates can lead to vulnerabilities in systems provisioned by Foreman, making them easier to exploit.
        *   **Vulnerable Template Code Exploitation (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in template syntax or used modules/roles within Foreman templates can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control over systems provisioned via Foreman.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure (High Impact Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and preventing hardcoded credentials from being deployed through Foreman templates.
        *   **Configuration Mismanagement in Provisioned Systems (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces the risk by identifying and correcting insecure configurations in Foreman templates before systems are provisioned.
        *   **Vulnerable Template Code Exploitation (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces the risk by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities within Foreman template code.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use `yamllint` for basic syntax checks in our template repository CI, but it's not specifically configured for security scanning of Foreman templates and integrated with Foreman's template management.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Security-focused scanning rules need to be added to `yamllint` or a dedicated security scanner needs to be integrated specifically for Foreman template content.
        *   Integration with Foreman's template management workflow is missing. Scans are not automatically triggered when templates are updated or used within Foreman.
        *   A clear remediation workflow for scan failures related to Foreman templates is not formally defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Template Management - Utilize Parameterization and External Data Sources](./mitigation_strategies/secure_template_management_-_utilize_parameterization_and_external_data_sources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Parameterization and External Data Sources

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Foreman:** Identify all sensitive data currently hardcoded within Foreman templates, parameters, or configuration objects (passwords, API keys, certificates, etc.).
        2.  **Parameterize Foreman Templates and Configurations:** Replace hardcoded sensitive data in Foreman templates and configurations with Foreman parameters (variables).
        3.  **Implement Foreman External Data Lookup:** Configure Foreman to use external data sources for resolving parameter values containing sensitive information. Leverage Foreman's built-in capabilities:
            *   **Foreman External Lookup (foreman\_lookup):** Utilize Foreman's external lookup feature to retrieve secrets from external sources configured within Foreman.
            *   **HashiCorp Vault Integration (Foreman Plugin):** Integrate Foreman with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions using available Foreman plugins. Configure Foreman to retrieve secrets from Vault based on parameters.
            *   **Custom External Script (Foreman External Lookup):** Develop a custom external lookup script that Foreman can execute to retrieve secrets from a secure location accessible to the Foreman server.
        4.  **Secure Data Source Configuration within Foreman:** Ensure the external data source configuration within Foreman is secure. Restrict access to Foreman settings related to external lookup and secrets management to authorized Foreman administrators.
        5.  **Test Parameterization in Foreman:** Thoroughly test parameterized Foreman templates and configurations to ensure secrets are correctly and securely injected during provisioning and configuration management processes initiated by Foreman.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure in Foreman (High Severity):** Eliminates the risk of exposing hardcoded credentials within Foreman templates and configurations stored in Foreman's database or version control systems.
        *   **Credential Theft from Foreman System (High Severity):** Prevents attackers who gain access to the Foreman system (database, files) from directly obtaining sensitive credentials stored within Foreman templates or configurations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure in Foreman (High Impact Reduction):**  Completely eliminates the risk of hardcoded credentials within Foreman itself.
        *   **Credential Theft from Foreman System (High Impact Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of credential theft from a compromised Foreman system.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use Foreman parameters for some configurations, but sensitive credentials are still sometimes managed through Foreman's internal parameter system, not a dedicated external secrets manager integrated with Foreman.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full migration to external secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault integrated with Foreman) for all sensitive credentials used in Foreman provisioning and configuration.
        *   Consistent enforcement of parameterization for all new Foreman templates and configurations involving secrets.
        *   Auditing of parameter usage and access within Foreman to ensure proper control over secrets managed by Foreman.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security - Plugin Source Verification](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_-_plugin_source_verification.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Plugin Source Verification

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish Trusted Foreman Plugin Sources:** Define a list of trusted sources for Foreman plugins. Prioritize the official Foreman plugin repository (`rubygems.org`) and plugins from reputable developers or organizations known within the Foreman community.
        2.  **Foreman Plugin Vetting Process:** Implement a process for vetting new Foreman plugins before installation within your Foreman instance. This process should include:
            *   **Source Code Review (if feasible):** Review the plugin's source code (available on platforms like GitHub for many Foreman plugins) for potentially malicious code or vulnerabilities.
            *   **Reputation Check within Foreman Community:** Research the plugin developer/organization's reputation and history within the Foreman community. Look for community feedback and reviews.
            *   **Security Audits (if available):** Check if the Foreman plugin has undergone any publicly available security audits or vulnerability assessments performed by reputable security firms or the Foreman project itself.
        3.  **Restrict Foreman Plugin Installation Sources (if possible):** Explore if Foreman offers configuration options to restrict plugin installations to specific sources. If possible, configure Foreman to only allow plugin installations from the defined trusted sources.
        4.  **Document Approved Foreman Plugins:** Maintain a documented list of approved and vetted Foreman plugins that are permitted for use within your Foreman environment. This list should be readily accessible to Foreman administrators.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Foreman Plugin Installation (High Severity):** Prevents the installation of malicious Foreman plugins that could compromise the Foreman server itself or managed hosts through Foreman's functionalities.
        *   **Vulnerable Foreman Plugin Installation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of installing Foreman plugins with known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the Foreman system or managed infrastructure.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Foreman Plugin Installation (High Impact Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing plugin installation from untrusted sources within Foreman.
        *   **Vulnerable Foreman Plugin Installation (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces the risk by promoting the use of plugins from reputable sources and encouraging vetting before installing plugins in Foreman.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We generally prefer plugins from the official Foreman repository, but there isn't a formal vetting process specifically for Foreman plugins or restriction on installation sources within Foreman.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal Foreman plugin vetting process and documentation.
        *   Configuration within Foreman to restrict plugin installation sources (if such options exist in Foreman).
        *   Regular review of installed Foreman plugins and their sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security - Regular Plugin Updates](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_-_regular_plugin_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Plugin Updates

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish Foreman Plugin Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking and applying updates to Foreman plugins installed in your Foreman instance (e.g., weekly, monthly).
        2.  **Monitoring for Foreman Plugin Updates:** Implement a mechanism to monitor for available updates for installed Foreman plugins. This could involve:
            *   **Foreman CLI/Web UI Checks:** Regularly check for plugin updates using Foreman's command-line interface (`foreman-installer --scenario katello --upgrade`) or web UI plugin management section.
            *   **Automated Update Notifications (if available):** Explore if Foreman or plugin management tools offer automated notifications (e.g., email alerts) when Foreman plugin updates are available.
            *   **Foreman Plugin Update Management Tools/Scripts:** Investigate and utilize Foreman plugin management tools or scripts that automate update checks and application specifically for Foreman plugins.
        3.  **Testing Foreman Plugin Updates:** Before applying updates to the production Foreman instance, test them in a staging or development Foreman environment that mirrors your production setup. This ensures compatibility with your Foreman version and other plugins and avoids unexpected issues in production.
        4.  **Document Foreman Plugin Update Process:** Document the Foreman plugin update process, including steps for checking, testing, and applying updates within your Foreman environment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**

        *   Formal testing process for Foreman plugin updates in a staging Foreman environment.
        *   Documentation of the Foreman plugin update process and schedule.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Foreman Server Security - Secure Foreman Web UI and API Access - Enforce HTTPS](./mitigation_strategies/secure_foreman_server_security_-_secure_foreman_web_ui_and_api_access_-_enforce_https.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Foreman Web UI and API Access - Enforce HTTPS

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate for Foreman:** Obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate specifically for the Foreman server's hostname or FQDN. This can be obtained from a public Certificate Authority (CA) for publicly accessible Foreman instances or generated internally if using a private CA for internal Foreman deployments.
        2.  **Configure Foreman Web Server for HTTPS:** Configure the web server used by Foreman (e.g., Apache, Nginx - often configured via `foreman-installer` for Foreman) to use HTTPS and the obtained SSL/TLS certificate. This typically involves modifying Foreman's web server configuration files to enable SSL/TLS and specify the certificate and private key paths. Use `foreman-installer` to manage SSL configuration for Foreman.
        3.  **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS for Foreman:** Configure the web server to automatically redirect all HTTP requests directed to the Foreman server to HTTPS. This ensures that all communication with the Foreman web UI and API is encrypted by default. This is often handled automatically by `foreman-installer` when enabling HTTPS.
        4.  **HSTS Configuration for Foreman (Optional but Recommended):** Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for the Foreman web server. HSTS instructs browsers to always connect to the Foreman server over HTTPS, even if the user initially types `http://` in the address bar or follows an HTTP link. This further reduces the risk of accidental unencrypted connections to Foreman.
        5.  **Regular Foreman Certificate Renewal:** Implement a process for regular SSL/TLS certificate renewal for the Foreman server to prevent certificate expiration, which would disrupt access to Foreman services. Automate certificate renewal using tools like Let's Encrypt or your internal certificate management system, and integrate with Foreman's configuration if possible.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Foreman (High Severity):** Prevents MITM attacks where attackers intercept and eavesdrop on communication between users and the Foreman server, potentially stealing Foreman login credentials, API keys, or sensitive data managed within Foreman.
        *   **Data Eavesdropping on Foreman Communication (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data transmitted between users and the Foreman server (including provisioning data, configuration details, credentials) from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Foreman (High Impact Reduction):**  Effectively eliminates the risk of MITM attacks on Foreman web UI and API by encrypting all communication.
        *   **Data Eavesdropping on Foreman Communication (High Impact Reduction):**  Completely prevents data eavesdropping on communication with Foreman by ensuring all traffic is encrypted.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. HTTPS is enforced for our Foreman web UI and API access using a valid SSL/TLS certificate managed via `foreman-installer`. HTTP to HTTPS redirection is also configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   HSTS configuration is not currently enabled for Foreman.
        *   Formal documentation of the Foreman HTTPS configuration and certificate renewal process could be improved, specifically outlining the use of `foreman-installer`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Foreman Server Security - Secure Foreman Web UI and API Access - Strong Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/secure_foreman_server_security_-_secure_foreman_web_ui_and_api_access_-_strong_authentication_and_au_b9fa55b3.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Foreman Web UI and API Access - Strong Authentication and Authorization

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies in Foreman:** Configure Foreman's authentication settings to enforce strong password policies for all Foreman user accounts. Utilize Foreman's built-in user management features to set requirements for:
            *   Minimum password length within Foreman.
            *   Password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) enforced by Foreman.
            *   Password history to prevent password reuse within Foreman.
            *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts to Foreman. Configure lockout thresholds and durations within Foreman.
        2.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Foreman:** Enable MFA for all Foreman user accounts. Leverage Foreman's MFA capabilities or integrate with external MFA providers (if supported by Foreman plugins). This adds an extra layer of security to Foreman access beyond passwords, requiring users to provide a second factor (e.g., TOTP, hardware token) when logging into Foreman.
        3.  **Utilize Foreman Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Leverage Foreman's robust RBAC system to define granular roles with specific permissions within Foreman. Assign users to Foreman roles based on their job responsibilities and the principle of least privilege. Restrict user access within Foreman to only the functionalities and resources they absolutely need to perform their tasks within the Foreman system.
        4.  **Regular Foreman User Access Reviews:** Periodically review Foreman user accounts and their assigned roles within Foreman. Ensure that user access levels are still appropriate and remove or disable Foreman accounts for users who no longer require access to the Foreman system.
        5.  **Audit Logging of Foreman Authentication and Authorization Events:** Enable and actively monitor audit logs for authentication and authorization events within Foreman. Foreman's audit logging should capture login attempts, role changes, permission modifications, and API access. Regularly review these Foreman logs to detect and investigate suspicious login attempts or unauthorized access attempts to Foreman.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Password Attacks on Foreman (High Severity):** Strong password policies and MFA for Foreman accounts make brute-force attacks against Foreman login significantly more difficult.
        *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks on Foreman (High Severity):** MFA for Foreman effectively mitigates credential stuffing attacks where attackers use stolen credentials from other breaches to attempt to log into Foreman.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Foreman due to Weak Passwords (High Severity):** Strong password policies within Foreman reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Foreman due to easily guessable or weak user passwords.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Foreman (Medium Severity):** Granular RBAC within Foreman and least privilege principles limit the potential damage from compromised Foreman accounts by restricting their access and permissions within the Foreman system itself.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Password Attacks on Foreman (High Impact Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of successful brute-force attacks against Foreman.
        *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks on Foreman (High Impact Reduction):**  Effectively mitigates the risk of credential stuffing attacks targeting Foreman.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Foreman due to Weak Passwords (High Impact Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized Foreman access.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Foreman (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Reduces the potential impact of compromised Foreman accounts by limiting their privileges within Foreman.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Strong password policies are enforced within Foreman. RBAC is utilized to some extent in Foreman, but could be more granular. MFA is not currently implemented for Foreman user accounts.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Foreman user accounts.
        *   More granular RBAC configuration within Foreman to enforce least privilege more effectively across all Foreman functionalities.
        *   Formal scheduled user access reviews specifically for Foreman accounts and roles.
        *   Proactive monitoring and analysis of authentication and authorization audit logs generated by Foreman.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Scheduled and consistently followed Foreman update schedule.
        *   Mandatory testing of Foreman updates in a dedicated staging environment before production deployment.
        *   Formal documentation of the Foreman update process and schedule.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Foreman Server Security - Secure Communication Channels for Foreman Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_foreman_server_security_-_secure_communication_channels_for_foreman_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Communication Channels for Foreman Components

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enforce HTTPS for Foreman to Smart Proxy Communication:** Ensure all communication between the Foreman server and Foreman Smart Proxies is encrypted using HTTPS. Configure Smart Proxies to use SSL/TLS certificates and configure Foreman to communicate with Smart Proxies over HTTPS. This is often configured during Smart Proxy installation and Foreman setup using `foreman-installer`.
        2.  **Secure Foreman Agent Communication (if applicable):** If using Foreman agents (e.g., for remote execution), ensure communication between Foreman and agents is also secured. Use secure protocols and authentication mechanisms supported by the agent technology.
        3.  **Verify Smart Proxy SSL/TLS Configuration:** Regularly verify the SSL/TLS configuration of Foreman Smart Proxies to ensure certificates are valid, up-to-date, and properly configured for secure communication with the Foreman server.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Credential Management Security - Centralized Credential Management within Foreman](./mitigation_strategies/credential_management_security_-_centralized_credential_management_within_foreman.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Centralized Credential Management within Foreman

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Utilize Foreman's Credential Features:** Leverage Foreman's built-in features for managing credentials. This includes using Foreman's Hosts -> Credentials section to define and store credentials centrally within Foreman instead of hardcoding them in templates or scripts.
        2.  **Categorize and Organize Foreman Credentials:** Organize Foreman credentials into logical categories and groups within Foreman to improve manageability and access control.
        3.  **Reference Foreman Credentials in Templates and Configurations:** When provisioning or configuring hosts through Foreman, reference the centrally managed credentials stored in Foreman using Foreman's parameterization and lookup mechanisms. Avoid directly embedding credentials in templates or configuration files.
        4.  **Limit Direct Access to Foreman Credentials:** Restrict direct access to Foreman's credential management interface and API to only authorized Foreman administrators and users with a legitimate need to manage credentials. Utilize Foreman's RBAC to control access to credential management features.
        5.  **Audit Foreman Credential Access and Usage:** Enable audit logging for access and usage of credentials managed within Foreman. Regularly review these audit logs to detect any unauthorized access or misuse of credentials stored in Foreman.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Credentials Stored in Foreman Database (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of credentials being exposed if the Foreman database is compromised, as secrets are stored in a dedicated, more secure secrets management system.
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Foreman Configurations (High Severity):** Eliminates the need to hardcode credentials within Foreman configurations by retrieving them dynamically from the secrets manager.
        *   **Credential Theft from Foreman System (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of credential theft from the Foreman system itself, as sensitive credentials are not persistently stored within Foreman.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Credentials Stored in Foreman Database (High Impact Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk by storing secrets externally.
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Foreman Configurations (High Impact Reduction):**  Eliminates hardcoding by retrieving secrets dynamically.
        *   **Credential Theft from Foreman System (High Impact Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of theft from Foreman itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Missing implementation. We are not currently integrated with a dedicated secrets management solution for Foreman.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Selection and deployment of a suitable secrets management solution.
        *   Integration of Foreman with the chosen secrets management solution using plugins or custom integration.
        *   Migration of all sensitive credentials used by Foreman to the external secrets manager.
        *   Configuration of Foreman parameter lookup to retrieve secrets from the secrets manager.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Credential Management Security - Credential Rotation and Auditing for Foreman Managed Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/credential_management_security_-_credential_rotation_and_auditing_for_foreman_managed_credentials.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Credential Rotation and Auditing for Foreman Managed Credentials

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Rotatable Credentials in Foreman:** Identify credentials managed by Foreman that should be rotated regularly (e.g., service account passwords, API keys used for provisioning, database credentials).
        2.  **Implement Automated Credential Rotation:** Implement automated credential rotation for identified credentials. This can be achieved through:
            *   **Secrets Management Integration (Preferred):** If integrated with a secrets management solution, leverage the secrets manager's built-in credential rotation capabilities. Configure Foreman to automatically retrieve rotated credentials from the secrets manager.
            *   **Custom Rotation Scripts:** Develop custom scripts or workflows that automate credential rotation for Foreman managed credentials. These scripts should generate new credentials, update Foreman configurations to use the new credentials, and securely store or manage the new credentials (ideally in a secrets manager).
        3.  **Define Rotation Schedules:** Define appropriate rotation schedules for different types of credentials based on risk assessment and security policies. More sensitive credentials should be rotated more frequently.
        4.  **Audit Credential Usage and Access in Foreman:** Enable comprehensive audit logging for credential usage and access within Foreman. Track which users or systems access which credentials and when. Regularly review these audit logs to detect any suspicious or unauthorized credential access.
        5.  **Alerting on Credential Rotation Failures:** Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators in case of credential rotation failures or errors. Promptly investigate and resolve rotation failures to maintain a secure credential posture.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromised Credentials Remain Valid Long-Term (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of compromised credentials remaining valid for extended periods, limiting the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit them.
        *   **Increased Risk of Credential Reuse (Medium Severity):** Regular rotation discourages credential reuse across different systems or services, reducing the impact of a single credential compromise.
        *   **Undetected Credential Theft or Misuse (Medium Severity):** Auditing helps detect potential credential theft or misuse by providing visibility into credential access patterns.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Credentials Remain Valid Long-Term (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Reduces the impact by limiting the validity period of compromised credentials.
        *   **Increased Risk of Credential Reuse (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of credential reuse.
        *   **Undetected Credential Theft or Misuse (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Improves detection capabilities through auditing.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Credential rotation for Foreman managed credentials is not currently automated or regularly performed. Auditing of credential usage within Foreman is basic.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implementation of automated credential rotation for relevant Foreman managed credentials.
        *   Integration with a secrets management solution to facilitate secure credential rotation.
        *   More comprehensive auditing of credential usage and access within Foreman.
        *   Alerting mechanisms for credential rotation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Credential Management Security - Principle of Least Privilege for Foreman Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/credential_management_security_-_principle_of_least_privilege_for_foreman_credentials.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Foreman Credentials

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Foreman Roles Requiring Credential Access:** Identify specific Foreman roles and users that require access to credentials managed within Foreman for legitimate purposes (e.g., provisioning, configuration management).
        2.  **Grant Minimal Necessary Credential Access:** Utilize Foreman's RBAC system and credential management features to grant users and roles only the minimal necessary access to credentials required for their specific tasks. Avoid granting broad or unnecessary credential access.
        3.  **Separate Credentials by Function and Scope:** Organize and separate credentials within Foreman based on their function and scope. For example, separate credentials used for provisioning different environments or services. Grant access only to the relevant credential sets based on user roles and responsibilities.
        4.  **Regularly Review Credential Access Permissions:** Periodically review Foreman user roles and their assigned credential access permissions. Ensure that access levels are still appropriate and remove any unnecessary or excessive credential access grants.
        5.  **Enforce Least Privilege for API Access to Credentials:** If Foreman API access is used to manage or retrieve credentials, enforce the principle of least privilege for API keys and API user permissions. Restrict API access to credentials to only authorized applications and services.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Credentials via Foreman (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive credentials managed by Foreman due to overly permissive access controls.
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Credential Access (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential impact of compromised Foreman accounts by restricting their access to credentials, preventing them from escalating privileges through unauthorized credential usage.
        *   **Accidental Credential Misuse or Exposure (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental credential misuse or exposure by limiting the number of users with access to sensitive credentials.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Credentials via Foreman (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Reduces the risk by limiting access to only authorized users.
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Credential Access (Medium Impact Reduction):**  Limits the potential for privilege escalation.
        *   **Accidental Credential Misuse or Exposure (Low Impact Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of accidental misuse or exposure.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We utilize Foreman RBAC to control access to some Foreman features, but credential access control could be more granular and consistently enforced based on least privilege principles.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   More granular RBAC policies specifically focused on credential access within Foreman.
        *   Formal process for regularly reviewing and adjusting credential access permissions based on least privilege.
        *   Clear documentation and guidelines for applying least privilege principles to Foreman credential management.
