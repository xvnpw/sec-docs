## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Initial Access to Foreman**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_initial_access_to_foreman.md)

*   This is the foundational step. Successful attacks here allow further exploitation.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   Exploiting Web UI vulnerabilities
        *   Exploiting API vulnerabilities
        *   Exploiting plugin vulnerabilities (less emphasized in high-risk, but still possible)
        *   Supply chain compromise (less likely, but high impact)

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Foreman Web UI Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_foreman_web_ui_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Targeting the web interface, a common entry point for web applications.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known Foreman Web UI Vulnerabilities**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
                *   Attack Vectors: Researching and exploiting known CVEs affecting the Foreman Web UI. Utilizing public exploits or developing custom exploits based on vulnerability details. Targeting unpatched Foreman instances.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations in Web UI Security**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Weak or Default Credentials:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks against the Foreman login page. Attempting to use default credentials if they haven't been changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Foreman API Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_foreman_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Targeting the API, often used for automation and integrations, but can be less scrutinized than the Web UI.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known Foreman API Vulnerabilities**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Publicly Disclosed API Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
                *   Attack Vectors: Researching and exploiting known CVEs affecting the Foreman API. Utilizing public exploits or developing custom exploits. Targeting unpatched Foreman instances.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit API Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**
            *   Attack Vectors:
                *   API Key Compromise: Stealing API keys through insecure storage, network interception, or social engineering.
                *   Weak API Authentication Mechanisms: Bypassing or brute-forcing weak API authentication methods.
                *   Insufficient API Authorization: Exploiting flaws in authorization logic to access unauthorized API endpoints or perform actions beyond intended privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Escalate Privileges within Foreman (If initial access is limited)**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__escalate_privileges_within_foreman__if_initial_access_is_limited_.md)

*   Necessary if initial access is gained with low-privileged accounts.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Legitimate Foreman Features with Stolen Credentials:**
            *   Attack Vectors: If an attacker gains access with limited user credentials, they might try to abuse legitimate features available to that user to escalate privileges or cause wider impact. This could involve exploiting features in unexpected ways or chaining legitimate actions to achieve malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Leverage Foreman Access to Compromise Managed Application Infrastructure**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__leverage_foreman_access_to_compromise_managed_application_infrastructure.md)

*   The ultimate goal - using Foreman's capabilities to attack the managed infrastructure.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Provision Malicious Infrastructure via Foreman**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Code into Provisioning Templates:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Modifying provisioning templates (e.g., Puppet, Ansible, Chef templates) to inject malicious code that will be executed on newly provisioned systems. This code could establish backdoors, install malware, or alter system configurations.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configuration Management Abuse via Foreman**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify Configuration Management Data:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Altering configuration management data (e.g., Puppet manifests, Ansible playbooks) stored within Foreman or linked to it. This can lead to deploying malicious configurations across managed systems during the next configuration management run.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Configuration Management Code:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Directly injecting malicious code into configuration management manifests or playbooks managed by Foreman. This code will be deployed and executed on managed systems.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Configuration Management Runs with Malicious Configurations:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Forcing or scheduling configuration management runs to deploy compromised configurations to managed systems.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Remote Command Execution via Foreman**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Foreman Remote Execution Features:**
                *   Attack Vectors: Utilizing Foreman's built-in remote execution features (e.g., SSH, Ansible) to directly run commands on managed systems. If an attacker has sufficient privileges in Foreman, they can use this to execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage SSH Key Management**
            *   Attack Vectors: If Foreman manages SSH keys for managed systems, an attacker who compromises Foreman might gain access to these keys. They can then use these keys to directly access managed systems via SSH, bypassing other Foreman functionalities.
