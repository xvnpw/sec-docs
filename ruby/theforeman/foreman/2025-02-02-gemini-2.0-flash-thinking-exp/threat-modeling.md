# Threat Model Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Foreman (e.g., through compromised credentials or API vulnerability) and injects malicious configuration code (Puppet, Ansible, etc.) into configuration templates or directly into host configurations. This malicious code is then deployed to managed hosts during configuration management runs.
**Impact:** Full compromise of managed hosts, including data breaches, installation of backdoors, disruption of services, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.
**Foreman Component Affected:** Configuration Management Modules (Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Salt), Configuration Templates, Host Configuration Management.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Foreman to restrict access to configuration management features.
* Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Foreman user accounts, especially administrators.
* Regularly audit Foreman user permissions and access logs.
* Implement code review processes for configuration templates and modules before deployment.
* Use version control for configuration templates and modules to track changes and enable rollback.
* Employ input validation and sanitization for configuration parameters to prevent injection attacks.
* Utilize Foreman's built-in features for configuration validation and testing before deployment to production.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Host Provisioning](./threats/unauthorized_host_provisioning.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Foreman's provisioning workflows or access controls (e.g., API access, weak authentication) to provision unauthorized virtual machines or bare metal servers. These rogue hosts can be used for malicious purposes like cryptomining, launching attacks, or data exfiltration.
**Impact:** Resource exhaustion on the infrastructure, increased cloud costs, potential for malicious activities originating from within the managed environment, reputational damage.
**Foreman Component Affected:** Provisioning Modules (Compute Resources, Hosts Module, API), Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly control access to Foreman's provisioning features through RBAC.
* Secure Foreman API access with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate Foreman and provisioned hosts.
* Monitor provisioning activity logs for suspicious or unauthorized requests.
* Implement resource quotas and limits for provisioning to prevent resource exhaustion.
* Regularly review and audit provisioned hosts to identify and remove unauthorized instances.

## Threat: [Exposure of Stored Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_stored_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Foreman's database or configuration files (e.g., through SQL injection, file inclusion vulnerability, or compromised server) where credentials for managed hosts and services (SSH keys, passwords, API tokens) are stored. The attacker can then extract these credentials.
**Impact:** Widespread compromise of managed hosts and services, lateral movement within the infrastructure, data breaches, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
**Foreman Component Affected:** Database (PostgreSQL, etc.), Credential Storage mechanisms, Foreman Server file system.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt sensitive credentials at rest in the database and configuration files using strong encryption algorithms.
* Implement robust access controls to the Foreman database and server file system.
* Regularly patch and update Foreman and its underlying operating system and database to address known vulnerabilities.
* Harden the Foreman server and database server according to security best practices.
* Minimize the storage of sensitive credentials within Foreman where possible, consider using external secret management solutions.
* Regularly audit credential storage and access patterns.

## Threat: [API Authentication Bypass](./threats/api_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Foreman's API authentication or authorization mechanisms (e.g., insecure API endpoints, flawed authentication logic) to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to the Foreman API. This allows them to perform actions as a privileged user without proper authentication.
**Impact:** Full control over Foreman functionality, including provisioning, configuration management, and data access, leading to widespread infrastructure compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
**Foreman Component Affected:** Foreman API, Authentication and Authorization Modules.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the Foreman API.
* Ensure all API endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized.
* Implement strong API authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper scoping).
* Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining Foreman API endpoints.
* Keep Foreman and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
* Implement rate limiting and input validation on API endpoints to prevent abuse and injection attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_plugins.md)

**Description:** An administrator installs or uses vulnerable third-party plugins within Foreman. These plugins may contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, cross-site scripting) that attackers can exploit to compromise Foreman itself or managed infrastructure.
**Impact:** Compromise of Foreman, potential for lateral movement to managed hosts, data breaches, disruption of Foreman functionality.
**Foreman Component Affected:** Plugin Architecture, Plugin Modules, Foreman Core.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
* Thoroughly vet and security audit plugins before installation.
* Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review installed plugins and remove any unnecessary or outdated ones.
* Implement a plugin security policy and guidelines for plugin usage.
* Consider using plugin vulnerability scanning tools if available.
