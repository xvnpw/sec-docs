# Attack Surface Analysis for theforeman/foreman

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Foreman's web UI authentication mechanisms allow attackers to gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.

**Foreman Contribution:** Foreman's web UI is the primary interface for managing infrastructure. Weaknesses in its authentication (e.g., session management, password handling) directly expose the entire Foreman system and managed infrastructure.

**Example:** A vulnerability in Foreman's session cookie generation allows an attacker to forge a valid session cookie and bypass login, gaining administrator access to the Foreman web UI.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Foreman system, including access to sensitive data, control over managed infrastructure, and potential data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Foreman and its dependencies updated: Regularly patch Foreman and underlying libraries to address known authentication vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce strong password policies: Mandate complex passwords and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for web UI access.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing:  Proactively identify and remediate authentication vulnerabilities.
*   Implement robust session management: Use secure session cookies, session timeouts, and invalidate sessions on logout.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Foreman's API authentication mechanisms allow attackers to access the API without proper authorization.

**Foreman Contribution:** Foreman's API is used for automation, integrations, and potentially by external systems. Weak API authentication exposes programmatic access to Foreman's functionalities and data.

**Example:**  An API endpoint intended for internal use is inadvertently exposed without authentication, allowing an attacker to create or modify infrastructure configurations via the API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Foreman's functionalities, data manipulation, potential disruption of services, and compromise of managed infrastructure through API commands.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong API authentication: Utilize API keys, tokens, or OAuth 2.0 for API access control.
*   Principle of least privilege for API access: Grant API access only to authorized users and applications with minimal necessary permissions.
*   Regularly review and audit API access controls: Ensure API keys and tokens are properly managed and rotated.
*   Secure API endpoint design:  Carefully design API endpoints and ensure proper authorization checks are in place for all sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_web_ui.md)

**Description:**  Input validation vulnerabilities in Foreman's web UI allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in users' browsers.

**Foreman Contribution:** Foreman's web UI handles various user inputs for configuration, provisioning, and reporting. Unsanitized inputs can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a custom host parameter field. When an administrator views the host details, the JavaScript executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, account compromise, defacement of the web UI, redirection to malicious sites, and potential information theft.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding: Sanitize all user inputs and properly encode outputs displayed in the web UI to prevent JavaScript injection.
*   Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
*   Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities: Use automated tools and manual code reviews to identify and fix XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or entering data from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/template_injection.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Foreman's template processing allow attackers to inject malicious code into templates, leading to remote code execution.

**Foreman Contribution:** Foreman uses templates (e.g., ERB) for provisioning, configuration management, and custom scripts. Template engines, if not handled securely, can be exploited for code injection.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a provisioning template by injecting malicious code within the template syntax. When Foreman processes this template during host provisioning, the injected code executes on the Foreman server or the target host.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on Foreman servers or managed hosts, full system compromise, data breaches, and disruption of services.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to template editing: Limit template modification permissions to authorized administrators only.
*   Implement secure template processing practices: Sanitize user inputs used in templates and use secure templating practices to prevent injection.
*   Regularly review and audit templates:  Inspect templates for any signs of malicious code or unintended functionality.
*   Consider using sandboxed template environments: If possible, use template engines in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Foreman Proxy Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/foreman_proxy_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Security vulnerabilities within the Foreman Proxy software itself can be exploited to compromise the proxy server and potentially managed hosts.

**Foreman Contribution:** Foreman relies on Foreman Proxy to communicate with and manage hosts in different networks. Vulnerabilities in the proxy directly impact the security of managed infrastructure.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Foreman Proxy's web server allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the proxy server by sending a specially crafted request.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Foreman Proxy server, potential remote code execution on managed hosts, disruption of communication between Foreman and managed infrastructure, and data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Foreman Proxy and its dependencies updated: Regularly patch Foreman Proxy and its underlying operating system and libraries to address known vulnerabilities.
*   Harden Foreman Proxy servers:  Apply security hardening measures to Foreman Proxy servers, including disabling unnecessary services, configuring firewalls, and using intrusion detection systems.
*   Secure communication channels: Ensure communication between Foreman and Foreman Proxy is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
*   Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of Foreman Proxy servers.
