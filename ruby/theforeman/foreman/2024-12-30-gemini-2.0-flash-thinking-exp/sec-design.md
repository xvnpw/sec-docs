**2. Goals**

* Present a more detailed and refined overview of the Foreman architecture.
* Provide enhanced descriptions of key components and their specific responsibilities, including security aspects.
* Illustrate the interactions and data flows between components with greater clarity and precision.
* Emphasize and expand upon the security considerations for each component and interaction, including potential threats.
* Serve as a more comprehensive and actionable basis for future threat modeling exercises.

**3. Target Audience**

This document is intended for a broader audience involved in the security and development of the Foreman project:

* Security architects and engineers responsible for threat modeling and security assessments.
* Software developers contributing to the Foreman project.
* Operations teams involved in deploying, managing, and securing Foreman instances.
