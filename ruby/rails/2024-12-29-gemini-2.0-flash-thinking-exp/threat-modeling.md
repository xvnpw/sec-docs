*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate HTTP request parameters to set model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This can lead to unauthorized modification of sensitive data, such as setting an `is_admin` flag to `true`.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to features or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveRecord::Base` (Model Layer), specifically attribute assignment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Strong Parameters to explicitly permit only the attributes that can be mass-assigned.
        *   Avoid directly assigning request parameters to model attributes without filtering.
        *   Carefully review and define the permitted parameters in each controller action.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Use of `find_by_sql` or Raw SQL
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into parameters used in `find_by_sql` or raw SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to or manipulating the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveRecord::Base` (Database Interaction), specifically methods for executing raw SQL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `find_by_sql` or raw SQL queries whenever possible.
        *   If raw SQL is necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs used in SQL queries.

*   **Threat:** Serialization/Deserialization Issues
    *   **Description:** If models serialize complex data structures (e.g., using `serialize` or `store_accessor`), an attacker might be able to inject malicious data that, when deserialized, leads to arbitrary code execution or other vulnerabilities. This is particularly relevant with formats like YAML.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveRecord::Serialization` (Data Serialization)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid serializing untrusted data.
        *   If serialization is necessary, use secure serialization formats like JSON and ensure proper sanitization.
        *   Be cautious when using YAML serialization, especially with user-provided data. Consider using `Psych.safe_load` for safer YAML parsing.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Use of `html_safe` or Raw Output
    *   **Description:** Developers might incorrectly use `html_safe` or output raw content in templates without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:**  ERB/HAML (Templating Engines), specifically output helpers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided content by default.
        *   Use Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms (`<%= %>`).
        *   Be extremely cautious when using `html_safe` and ensure the content is absolutely safe.
        *   Sanitize user input before displaying it if HTML is allowed.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via User Input in Render Paths
    *   **Description:** If user input is directly used to determine the template to render (e.g., in `render params[:template]`), an attacker could inject malicious template code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActionView::Rendering` (Template Rendering)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use user input directly to determine the template to render.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed templates or a predefined mapping.
        *   Treat user input as untrusted and avoid incorporating it directly into rendering paths.

*   **Threat:** Exposed Secret Keys and Credentials
    *   **Description:** If the Rails application's secret keys (used for session management, message signing, etc.) or other sensitive credentials are exposed (e.g., in version control, configuration files), attackers can compromise the application's security.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, ability to forge signatures and manipulate data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Rails::Application::Credentials`, `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor` (and related security components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store secret keys and credentials securely using environment variables or encrypted credentials files (Rails 5.2+).
        *   Never commit secrets directly to version control.
        *   Rotate secret keys periodically.
        *   Restrict access to configuration files containing sensitive information.

*   **Threat:** Development Mode Exposure in Production
    *   **Description:** Running a Rails application in development mode in a production environment exposes debugging information, error messages, and potentially sensitive data, making it easier for attackers to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier identification of attack vectors, potential for remote code execution through debugging tools.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Rails.env`, environment-specific configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` in production deployments.
        *   Disable development-specific middleware and features in production.
        *   Implement proper error handling and logging in production.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Asset Injection
    *   **Description:** If the asset pipeline is not configured correctly or if developers include user-generated content in assets without proper sanitization, attackers might be able to inject malicious scripts that are served to other users. For example, uploading an SVG file containing JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Sprockets` (Asset Pipeline)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize user-generated content before including it in assets.
        *   Configure the asset pipeline to serve assets with appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` headers.
        *   Be cautious about allowing users to upload arbitrary file types as assets.
