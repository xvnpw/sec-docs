Title: High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes for Rails Application

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself (focusing on high-risk areas).

Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
* Attack Vector: Bypassing Strong Parameters
    * Critical Node: Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
    * Description: Attackers manipulate request parameters to modify model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This occurs when developers incorrectly use `permit!` or fail to define strong parameters adequately.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Moderate to Significant (Data manipulation, privilege escalation)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure File Uploads (Rails Helpers)
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Form Handling Vulnerabilities
    * Critical Node: Exploit Insecure File Uploads (Rails Helpers)
    * Description: Attackers upload malicious files to the server due to insufficient validation of file type, size, or content. This can lead to remote code execution if the uploaded file is processed or accessible by the server.
    * Likelihood: Medium to High
    * Impact: Significant to Critical (Remote code execution, data breach)
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Database Interaction Vulnerabilities (ActiveRecord)
    * Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, typically through user-supplied input. This can allow them to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
        * Sub-Vector: Exploit Raw SQL Queries
        * Sub-Vector: Exploit Insecure Finders (e.g., `find_by_sql`)
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Critical (Complete database compromise)
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate to Difficult

High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Session Management (Rails Defaults)
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Session and Authentication Vulnerabilities
    * Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Session Management (Rails Defaults)
    * Description: Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application manages user sessions. Using the default session secret makes the application vulnerable to session hijacking, where an attacker steals a valid user's session cookie and impersonates them. Lack of `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags also increases risk.
        * Sub-Vector: Exploit Default Session Secret
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Account takeover)
    * Effort: Minimal
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult

High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Secret Key Management
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Configuration and Deployment Vulnerabilities
    * Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Secret Key Management
    * Description: The `secret_key_base` is a critical security credential used by Rails to sign and encrypt sensitive data, including session cookies. If this key is compromised, attackers can forge session cookies, decrypt encrypted data, and potentially gain full control of the application.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Session hijacking, data decryption)
    * Effort: Medium to High
    * Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult

High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerable Gems
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities (Gems)
    * Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerable Gems
    * Description: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (gems) used by the Rails application. This can range from minor issues to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
        * Sub-Vector: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Rails Dependencies
    * Likelihood: Medium to High
    * Impact: Varies (Can range from minor issues to remote code execution)
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

High-Risk Path: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Injection
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Template Rendering Vulnerabilities (ERB/Haml)
    * Critical Node: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Injection
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This occurs when user-provided data is not properly escaped before being rendered in templates, allowing the attacker's script to execute in the victim's browser.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Moderate (Client-side attacks, session hijacking, defacement)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

High-Risk Path: Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
* Attack Vector: Exploiting Template Rendering Vulnerabilities (ERB/Haml)
    * Critical Node: Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious code directly into template rendering logic. If the template engine processes user-controlled input as code, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: Critical (Remote code execution on the server)
    * Effort: Medium to High
    * Skill Level: Advanced to Expert
    * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
