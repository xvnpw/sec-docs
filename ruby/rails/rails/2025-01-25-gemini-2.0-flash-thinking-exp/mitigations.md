# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rails/rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strong_parameters.md)

**Description:**
1. In each controller action that handles user input (e.g., `create`, `update`), use `params.require(:model_name).permit(:attribute1, :attribute2, ...)` to define allowed parameters.
2. Place this parameter filtering logic at the beginning of the action, before any data processing or database interaction.
3. Explicitly list all attributes that are intended to be mass-assigned in the `permit` method.
4. Regularly review and update permitted parameters whenever models or application logic changes.
**Threats Mitigated:**
* Mass Assignment Vulnerability (High Severity) - Attackers can inject unexpected parameters via HTTP requests to modify model attributes they should not be able to access or change, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is directly related to Rails' mass assignment feature.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of Mass Assignment vulnerabilities by enforcing strict control over which attributes can be modified through mass assignment, leveraging Rails' built-in mechanism.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, generally implemented in most controllers using mass assignment throughout the project, as it's a standard Rails practice.
**Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing in newly created controllers or actions. Requires ongoing review, especially after model schema modifications or when adding new features involving user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTML Output Sanitization with `sanitize`](./mitigation_strategies/html_output_sanitization_with__sanitize_.md)

**Description:**
1. When displaying user-generated content that might contain HTML, use the `sanitize(user_content)` helper in your views. This is a built-in Rails helper.
2. For more control, configure `sanitize` with an allowlist of tags and attributes: `sanitize(user_content, tags: %w(p br b i), attributes: %w(class id))).
3. Avoid using `html_safe` unless you are absolutely certain the content is safe and has already been properly sanitized. Prefer `sanitize` for user-provided data.
4. If you need to allow more complex HTML, carefully review and expand the allowlist, understanding the risks associated with each tag and attribute.
**Threats Mitigated:**
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected and Stored (High Severity) - Attackers can inject malicious scripts into user-generated content that is then displayed to other users. Rails' `sanitize` helper is designed to prevent this.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities by removing or escaping potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes from user-provided content before it is rendered in the browser, utilizing Rails' sanitization tools.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, generally used in views where user-generated content is displayed, particularly in areas like comments, blog posts, or user profiles, as it's a common Rails security practice.
**Missing Implementation:** May be inconsistently applied across all views. Requires a codebase-wide audit to ensure `sanitize` is used wherever user-generated HTML is displayed, and that `html_safe` is used judiciously and only when necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ActiveRecord Query Interface for Database Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/activerecord_query_interface_for_database_interactions.md)

**Description:**
1. Primarily use ActiveRecord's query interface methods (e.g., `Model.where`, `Model.find_by`, `Model.create`) for all database interactions. ActiveRecord is Rails' ORM.
2. These methods automatically escape values, preventing SQL injection. This is a core security feature of ActiveRecord.
3. Avoid using raw SQL queries (`ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute`) unless absolutely necessary for complex queries not achievable with ActiveRecord.
4. If raw SQL is unavoidable, always parameterize queries using placeholders and bind parameters: `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", params[:username])`.
**Threats Mitigated:**
* SQL Injection (High Severity) - Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into application inputs. ActiveRecord's query interface is designed to mitigate this threat.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities by leveraging ActiveRecord's built-in protection mechanisms, a fundamental part of the Rails framework.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, ActiveRecord is the standard ORM in Rails, and its query interface is the primary method for database interaction throughout the project.
**Missing Implementation:** Potentially some legacy code or complex database operations might still use raw SQL queries. Requires a code review to identify and refactor any instances of raw SQL to use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection with `protect_from_forgery`](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_with__protect_from_forgery_.md)

**Description:**
1. Ensure `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` (or `:null_session`, `:reset_session`) is present and uncommented in your `ApplicationController`. This is a built-in Rails mechanism enabled by default in new applications.
2. For non-GET requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), Rails automatically verifies the presence and validity of a CSRF token.
3. For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`). You can retrieve the token using `<%= csrf_meta_tags %>` in your layout and access it in JavaScript - Rails helpers for CSRF.
4. For forms, use Rails form helpers (e.g., `form_with`) which automatically include the CSRF token in hidden fields.
**Threats Mitigated:**
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity) - Attackers can trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting malicious requests. Rails provides built-in CSRF protection to counter this.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of CSRF attacks by requiring a valid, unpredictable token to be present in requests that modify data, leveraging Rails' CSRF protection feature.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, `protect_from_forgery` is enabled in `ApplicationController`. CSRF tokens are automatically included in forms generated by Rails form helpers, as per Rails defaults.
**Missing Implementation:** Ensure CSRF tokens are correctly handled in all AJAX requests. Review JavaScript code to confirm tokens are being included in headers for all relevant requests. Potentially missing in custom form implementations outside of Rails helpers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Cookie Settings](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_cookie_settings.md)

**Description:**
1. Configure session cookie settings in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`. This file is part of Rails configuration.
2. Set `:secure: true` to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
3. Set `:httponly: true` to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
4. Set `:same_site: :strict` or `:lax` to control when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. These are standard Rails session cookie configuration options.
**Threats Mitigated:**
* Session Hijacking (Medium Severity) - Attackers can steal session cookies. Secure cookie settings in Rails help mitigate this.
* CSRF (Partially mitigated by `SameSite`) (Medium Severity) - `SameSite` attribute provides an additional layer of defense against CSRF attacks.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking and partially mitigates CSRF attacks by securing session cookie transmission and access, using Rails' session management configuration.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, these settings are generally configured in `config/initializers/session_store.rb` during project setup, as part of standard Rails security practices.
**Missing Implementation:** Review `config/initializers/session_store.rb` to confirm all recommended settings (`:secure`, `:httponly`, `:same_site`) are correctly configured and enabled, especially if the project is older or has been modified.
