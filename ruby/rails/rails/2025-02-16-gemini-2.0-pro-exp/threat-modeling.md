# Threat Model Analysis for rails/rails

## Threat: [Mass Assignment (Bypassed or Misconfigured)](./threats/mass_assignment__bypassed_or_misconfigured_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests with parameters that were not intended to be updated by the user. They might try to modify attributes like `admin`, `role`, or other sensitive fields to gain unauthorized privileges or manipulate data. This succeeds if `strong_parameters` are not used correctly, are bypassed with `permit!`, or if older, vulnerable Rails versions are in use.  This is a *direct* threat because it exploits Rails' parameter handling mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Data tampering, privilege escalation (becoming an administrator), account takeover, unauthorized data modification or deletion.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** ActionController (specifically, the parameter handling mechanism and `strong_parameters`). ActiveRecord (where the mass assignment ultimately occurs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict `strong_parameters` Usage:**  Always use `strong_parameters` in controllers to explicitly permit only the expected attributes.
    *   **Never Use `permit!`:** Avoid `permit!` entirely, as it disables all parameter protection.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit controller code for proper parameter handling.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential mass assignment vulnerabilities.
    *   **Up-to-Date Rails:** Keep Rails and related gems up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Unscoped Finders (Data Leakage)](./threats/unscoped_finders__data_leakage_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates URL parameters or other input to access records they shouldn't have access to. For example, if a URL is `/users/123/posts/456`, but the code doesn't check if post `456` actually belongs to user `123`, the attacker might try changing `456` to access other users' posts. This is more likely with custom finders or older Rails code. This is a *direct* threat because it exploits how Rails' ActiveRecord finders work.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information belonging to other users.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** ActiveRecord (specifically, finder methods like `find`, `find_by`, and custom finder methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Scope Finders:** Ensure all finders are scoped to the current user or context. Use associations (e.g., `@user.posts.find(params[:id])`) to enforce scoping.
    *   **`find_by` with Conditions:** Use `find_by` with appropriate conditions to verify ownership or access rights.
    *   **Avoid Raw SQL (Generally):** Minimize the use of raw SQL queries. If necessary, ensure proper parameterization and scoping.
    *   **Code Review and Refactoring:** Regularly review and refactor older code to use modern Rails conventions and ensure proper scoping.

## Threat: [Unintended Code Execution via `render` (Highly Unlikely, but Severe)](./threats/unintended_code_execution_via__render___highly_unlikely__but_severe_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker provides malicious input that is, *very unusually*, used directly in the `render` method to determine the template or partial to be rendered. This would require a significant deviation from standard Rails practices. The attacker could craft input that, when interpolated into the `render` call, causes Rails to execute arbitrary code. This is a *direct* threat because it targets the core rendering mechanism of Rails.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control of the server.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** ActionView (specifically, the `render` method).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but extremely low probability in well-written Rails applications)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Use User Input Directly in `render`:** Absolutely never use user-supplied input directly in the `render` method to specify the template or partial.
    *   **Strict Allowlist:** If dynamic rendering is *absolutely* necessary (which is highly discouraged), use a strict allowlist of permitted template/partial names.
    *   **Sanitize Indirect Input:** If user input *indirectly* influences template rendering (e.g., through a helper method), thoroughly sanitize and validate it.

## Threat: [`String#constantize` / `String#safe_constantize` Abuse](./threats/_string#constantize____string#safe_constantize__abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that is used in a call to `constantize` or `safe_constantize`. They craft the input to be the name of a class that, when instantiated, performs malicious actions (e.g., executes system commands, accesses sensitive data). This is a *direct* threat because it exploits these specific ActiveSupport methods.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), potentially other security issues depending on the instantiated class.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** ActiveSupport (specifically, the `String#constantize` and `String#safe_constantize` methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid with User Input:** Avoid using `constantize` or `safe_constantize` with user-supplied input.
    *   **Strict Allowlist:** If absolutely necessary, use a strict allowlist of permitted class names. Validate the user input against this allowlist before calling `constantize`.

## Threat: [YAML Deserialization (Untrusted Input)](./threats/yaml_deserialization__untrusted_input_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious YAML data as input to the application. If this data is deserialized using YAML, it can trigger the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the YAML payload. This is unlikely in a standard Rails setup but could occur if YAML is used for data interchange with external systems or user uploads. This is a *direct* threat if Rails' YAML parsing mechanisms are used with untrusted input.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** Potentially any component that uses YAML parsing (e.g., `YAML.load`, `Psych.load`). ActiveSupport if custom YAML handling is involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Deserialize Untrusted YAML:** Never deserialize YAML data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs without proper validation).
    *   **Safe YAML Parser:** If YAML deserialization is necessary, use a safe YAML parser like `Psych.safe_load` (available in newer versions of Psych). This restricts the types of objects that can be instantiated.

## Threat: [Secret Key Base Compromise](./threats/secret_key_base_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the application's `secret_key_base`, either through code leakage (e.g., committed to a public repository), server compromise, or by guessing a weak key. With the `secret_key_base`, the attacker can forge session cookies, decrypt encrypted data, and potentially gain full control of the application. This is a *direct* threat because the `secret_key_base` is a core Rails security component.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, forgery of signed or encrypted data, complete system compromise.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** Rails configuration (specifically, the `secret_key_base` setting). ActionDispatch (session management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Hardcode:** Never hardcode the `secret_key_base` in the codebase.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store the `secret_key_base` in an environment variable.
    *   **Strong Key Generation:** Use `rails secret` to generate a strong, random `secret_key_base`.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage the `secret_key_base`.
    *   **.gitignore:** Ensure that files containing secrets (like `config/master.key` in newer Rails versions) are added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Threat: [Outdated Rails Version](./threats/outdated_rails_version.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies that the application is running an outdated version of Rails by examining HTTP headers, error messages, or other publicly visible information. They then exploit *known* vulnerabilities in that specific Rails version. This is a *direct* threat because it targets the Rails framework itself.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and complete system compromise.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** Potentially any part of the Rails framework, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Ranges from High to Critical, depending on the vulnerabilities present in the outdated version.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update Rails to the latest stable version.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for the Rails framework (e.g., the Rails security mailing list) and apply patches promptly.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use `bundler-audit` or similar tools to identify and update vulnerable gems.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure via `to_json`/`as_json`](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_via__to_json__as_json_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker probes API endpoints or intercepts network traffic to discover sensitive data exposed through model serialization. They might try different parameters or nested resource requests to see if additional, unintended attributes are returned in JSON responses. This is particularly effective if developers haven't explicitly controlled which attributes are included in the JSON output. This is a *direct* threat because it targets Rails' built in serialization methods.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, leakage of PII (Personally Identifiable Information), financial data, or internal system details. This can lead to reputational damage, legal consequences, and financial loss.
*   **Rails Component Affected:** ActiveRecord (specifically, the `to_json` and `as_json` methods of model instances). Also, ActiveModel::Serializers (if misused).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Attribute Control:** Always explicitly define which attributes are allowed in JSON responses using `only` and `except` options within `as_json` or `to_json`.
    *   **Dedicated Serializers:** Use dedicated serializer gems like ActiveModel::Serializers or Jbuilder to manage JSON output and enforce a clear separation of concerns.
    *   **API Versioning:** Implement API versioning to prevent accidental exposure of new attributes in future updates.
    *   **Regular Code Review:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential over-exposure in serialization logic.

## Threat: [Session Fixation (Custom Session Management)](./threats/session_fixation__custom_session_management_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sets a user's session ID to a known value before the user authenticates. After the user logs in, the attacker uses the known session ID to hijack the user's session. This is only a risk if the application *does not* use Rails' built-in session management. This is a *direct* threat when custom session management is implemented incorrectly on top of Rails.
* **Impact:** Account takeover. The attacker gains full access to the user's account.
* **Rails Component Affected:** ActionDispatch (specifically, custom session management implementations).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Use Built-in Session Management:** The best mitigation is to use Rails' built-in session management, which handles session ID regeneration automatically.
    * **Regenerate Session ID:** If custom session management is *absolutely required*, ensure that the session ID is regenerated upon successful authentication.
    * **Secure Session Tokens:** Use strong, randomly generated session tokens.
    * **HTTP-Only and Secure Flags:** Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
