## Attack Tree Path: [[G] Gain Unauthorized Access/Execute Arbitrary Code [!] (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/_g__gain_unauthorized_accessexecute_arbitrary_code__!___root_goal_.md)

*   **[G] Gain Unauthorized Access/Execute Arbitrary Code [!] (Root Goal)**
    *   Description: The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[A] Remote Code Execution (RCE) [!]](./attack_tree_paths/_a__remote_code_execution__rce___!_.md)

*   **[A] Remote Code Execution (RCE) [!]**
    *   Description:  Achieving RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, often leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[A1] Unsafe Deserialization [!]](./attack_tree_paths/_a1__unsafe_deserialization__!_.md)

    *   **[A1] Unsafe Deserialization [!]**
        *   **High-Risk Path:** `[G] -> [A] -> [A1]`
        *   Description: Rails uses `Marshal.load` and `YAML.load` for some operations. If an attacker can inject malicious serialized data, they can achieve RCE.
        *   Mitigation:
            *   Strongly prefer JSON for serialization. Avoid `Marshal.load` and `YAML.load` with untrusted input.
            *   If using YAML, use `YAML.safe_load` (with a whitelist).
            *   Regularly update Rails and related gems.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).
            *   Consider a dedicated deserialization library.
            *   Audit code using `Marshal.load`, `YAML.load`, `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier`, and `ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile`.
        *   Example: An attacker crafts a malicious YAML payload that executes a system command upon deserialization.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[A3] SQL Injection (leading to RCE) [!]](./attack_tree_paths/_a3__sql_injection__leading_to_rce___!_.md)

    *   **[A3] SQL Injection (leading to RCE) [!]**
        *   **High-Risk Path:** `[G] -> [A] -> [A3]`
        *   Description: Using raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input can lead to SQL injection, which can be escalated to RCE in some databases.
        *   Mitigation:
            *   Always use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's query interface.
            *   If raw SQL is required, use the database adapter's escaping.
            *   Regularly review code for raw SQL usage.
            *   Use a database user with limited privileges.
        *   Example: `User.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '#{params[:username]}'")`
        *   Likelihood: Low (if ActiveRecord is used correctly)
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[A4] Vulnerable Gems [!]](./attack_tree_paths/_a4__vulnerable_gems__!_.md)

    *   **[A4] Vulnerable Gems [!]**
        *   **High-Risk Path:** `[G] -> [A] -> [A4]`
        *   Description: A vulnerability in a third-party gem can be exploited to achieve RCE.
        *   Mitigation:
            *   Regularly update all gems. Use `bundle outdated` and `bundler-audit`.
            *   Carefully vet new gems.
            *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner.
            *   Consider using a Gemfile.lock.
        *   Example: An outdated gem with a known RCE vulnerability is used.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Variable (can be Very High)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Variable
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[B] Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/_b__data_breach.md)

*   **[B] Data Breach**
    * Description: Attackers aim to access or modify sensitive data without authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[B2] Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) [!]](./attack_tree_paths/_b2__insecure_direct_object_references__idor___!_.md)

    *   **[B2] Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) [!]**
        *   **High-Risk Path:** `[G] -> [B] -> [B2]`
        *   Description: An attacker manipulates URLs or parameters to access resources they shouldn't have access to.
        *   Mitigation:
            *   Implement proper authorization checks in controllers and models.
            *   Use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
            *   Avoid exposing internal IDs.
            *   Use authorization libraries like Pundit or CanCanCan.
        *   Example: Changing the ID in `/users/1/edit` to `/users/2/edit` to edit another user's profile.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium to High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
