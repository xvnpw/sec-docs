# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rails/rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strong_parameters.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Parameters

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Controllers:** In each Rails controller handling user input for creating or updating model instances (`create`, `update`, `new` actions), locate code using the `params` hash.
    2.  **`require` Method:** Use `params.require(:model_name)` where `:model_name` matches the Rails model (e.g., `:user`, `:post`). This enforces the presence of the expected top-level key.
    3.  **`permit` Method:** Chain `.permit(:attribute1, :attribute2, ...)` to `require`. List *only* the attributes allowed for mass assignment. Example: `params.require(:user).permit(:username, :email, :password)`.  *Never* use `params.permit!` without a very specific, well-understood reason.
    4.  **Instance Variable:** Assign the result to an instance variable (e.g., `@user_params`).
    5.  **Model Interaction:** Use this variable with Rails model methods (e.g., `User.new(@user_params)`, `@user.update(@user_params)`).
    6.  **Nested Attributes:** For nested attributes (e.g., a `Post` has many `Comments`), use a hash within `permit`: `params.require(:post).permit(:title, :body, comments_attributes: [:id, :content, :_destroy])`. The `_destroy` attribute is a Rails convention for deleting associated records.
    7.  **Review and Test:** Review all Rails controllers and write tests (controller tests, request specs) to ensure only permitted attributes are modifiable.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from modifying attributes they shouldn't (e.g., setting `admin` to `true` via Rails' mass-assignment features).
    *   **Indirect Object Reference:** (Severity: Medium) - Indirectly helps prevent manipulation of object references exposed as attributes within Rails models.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with correct implementation).
    *   **Indirect Object Reference:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `UsersController`: Implemented for `create` and `update`.
    *   `PostsController`: Implemented for `create`, *not* for `update`.
    *   `CommentsController`: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `PostsController`: Missing in `update`. All parameters are passed to `update`.
    *   `CommentsController`: Completely missing. Uses `params[:comment]` directly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection with `protect_from_forgery`](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_with__protect_from_forgery_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** CSRF Protection with `protect_from_forgery`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify in `ApplicationController`:** Ensure `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` (or `with: :null_session`) is present and *not* commented out in your Rails `ApplicationController` (`app/controllers/application_controller.rb`). This is a core Rails security feature.
    2.  **Rails Form Helpers:** Use `form_with` (recommended) or `form_tag` for all forms. These Rails helpers *automatically* include the CSRF token, leveraging Rails' built-in protection. Avoid manual form construction.
    3.  **API Authentication (If Applicable):** For a Rails JSON API:
        *   Option 1 (Less Common): Require the CSRF token for non-GET requests.
        *   Option 2 (Recommended): Use a different authentication mechanism (API keys, JWTs) that's not CSRF-vulnerable. This is *not* inherently a Rails feature, but is important in the context of a Rails API.
    4.  **Test:** Use browser developer tools to inspect form submissions and ensure the Rails-generated CSRF token is present. Test submissions without/with invalid tokens.
    5.  **SameSite Cookie (Rails Configuration):** Configure the `SameSite` attribute for session cookies in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`. Set to `Lax` (recommended) or `Strict`. This leverages Rails' cookie configuration to enhance CSRF defense.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** (Severity: High) - Prevents forged requests on behalf of authenticated users, utilizing Rails' built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with correct implementation, especially with SameSite cookies).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` is in `ApplicationController`.
    *   Rails form helpers (`form_with`) are used consistently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   JSON API (`app/controllers/api/v1`) does *not* check CSRF tokens and lacks alternative authentication. Vulnerable to CSRF.
    *   `SameSite` cookie attribute is *not* explicitly configured, relying on Rails defaults (which might be insufficient).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Session Regeneration and Secure Cookies (Rails Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/session_regeneration_and_secure_cookies__rails_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Session Regeneration and Secure Cookies (Rails Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`force_ssl` (Rails Config):** Enable `config.force_ssl = true` in `config/environments/production.rb` (and ideally `development.rb`). This is a Rails configuration setting that enforces HTTPS.
    2.  **`reset_session` (Rails Method):** After successful authentication, call `reset_session` in your Rails authentication controller (e.g., `SessionsController#create`). This is a Rails method that regenerates the session ID.
    3.  **Secure Cookie (Rails/Rack):** Verify the `secure` attribute is set on session cookies.  Usually handled automatically by Rails when `force_ssl` is enabled.
    4.  **HttpOnly Cookie (Rails/Rack):** Verify the `HttpOnly` attribute is set (usually the Rails default).
    5.  **Session Timeout:** Implement a timeout (using a gem like `devise-security` or manually). This is often done in conjunction with Rails session management.
    6.  **Test:** Use browser tools to inspect cookies, ensuring `secure` and `HttpOnly` are set. Test login/logout to verify session ID changes (Rails behavior).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** (Severity: High) - `reset_session` (Rails method) prevents using a known session ID.
    *   **Session Hijacking (MitM):** (Severity: High) - `force_ssl` (Rails config) and `secure` cookie prevent plain text transmission.
    *   **Session Hijacking (XSS):** (Severity: High) - `HttpOnly` cookie (Rails/Rack default) prevents JavaScript access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Session Hijacking (MitM):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Session Hijacking (XSS):** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `force_ssl` enabled in `production.rb`.
    *   `reset_session` called in `SessionsController#create`.
    *   `secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes set (verified).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `force_ssl` *not* enabled in `development.rb`.
    *   No session timeout mechanism.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe SQL Practices with ActiveRecord](./mitigation_strategies/safe_sql_practices_with_activerecord.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Safe SQL Practices with ActiveRecord

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Parameterized Queries (ActiveRecord):** Always use ActiveRecord's query methods with placeholders. Examples:
        *   `User.where("username = ?", params[:username])`
        *   `User.where(username: params[:username])`
        *   `Post.find_by(id: params[:id])`
        These methods leverage ActiveRecord's built-in sanitization.
    2.  **Avoid String Interpolation:** *Never* use string interpolation with user input in SQL queries. This bypasses ActiveRecord's protection. *Never*: `User.where("username = '#{params[:username]}'")`.
    3.  **Raw SQL (with Extreme Caution):** If raw SQL is *essential* (and ActiveRecord cannot be used), use the database adapter's sanitization methods (e.g., `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.quote(params[:username])`). But parameterized ActiveRecord queries are *always* preferred.
    4.  **Least Privilege (Database, not Rails-specific):** Ensure the database user has only necessary permissions.
    5.  **Code Review:** Review code using ActiveRecord, looking for potential SQL injection.
    6.  **Automated Testing:** Include tests that attempt SQL injection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents malicious SQL code injection, relying on ActiveRecord's proper usage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with correct ActiveRecord usage).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameterized queries mostly used consistently.
    *   Least privilege database user configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   String interpolation found in a custom reporting function (`app/models/report.rb`). *Critical* vulnerability.
    *   No automated tests specifically target SQL injection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of User Input in Views (ERB and Helpers)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_user_input_in_views__erb_and_helpers_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Safe Handling of User Input in Views (ERB and Helpers)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automatic Escaping (ERB):** Understand that Rails, by default, escapes output in ERB templates (`<%= ... %>`).  This is a core Rails feature.
    2.  **`sanitize` Helper (With Whitelist):** Use `sanitize` *only* when you *must* allow a limited subset of HTML. *Always* provide a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes. Example: `sanitize(user_input, tags: %w(strong em a), attributes: %w(href))`. This is a Rails helper method.
    3.  **`raw` Helper (Avoid):** Use `raw` *extremely* sparingly, and only with pre-sanitized, trusted input. `raw` disables Rails' output escaping. If used, ensure thorough sanitization *before* calling `raw`.
    4.  **Context-Aware Escaping:** Be mindful of the context. Rails generally handles escaping for HTML, but be cautious when manually constructing HTML or JavaScript.
    5. **Avoid Inline JavaScript:** Minimize inline JavaScript (`<script>` tags in HTML). Favor external JavaScript files (easier to manage and subject to CSP, although CSP itself isn't Rails-specific).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Mitigates XSS by ensuring proper output escaping and controlled use of HTML, leveraging Rails' built-in escaping and helper methods.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (but relies on correct usage of Rails' helpers and avoiding misuse of `raw`).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default ERB escaping is in place.
    *   `sanitize` is used in a few places, but not always with a whitelist.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `raw` is used in one view (`app/views/posts/show.html.erb`) to render user-submitted content without prior sanitization. This is a *high* risk XSS vulnerability.
    *   Some uses of `sanitize` lack a whitelist, making them less effective.
    *   Inline JavaScript is present in several views.
