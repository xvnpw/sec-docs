# Attack Surface Analysis for rails/rails

## Attack Surface: [1. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify object attributes they should not have access to by manipulating request parameters. This occurs when user-provided data is directly used to update model attributes without proper filtering.
*   **Rails Contribution:** Rails models, by default, allow mass assignment. The framework relies on developers to implement `strong_parameters` (or `attr_accessible` in older versions) to control which attributes can be updated. Misconfiguration or insufficient use of these features creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A user can modify their `is_admin` attribute to `true` by adding `is_admin=true` to a form submission or API request if the controller action does not properly filter parameters using `strong_parameters`.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly use `strong_parameters`:**  In controllers, always use `params.require(:model_name).permit(:permitted_attributes)` to explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
    *   **Minimize permitted attributes:** Only permit attributes that are intended to be user-modifiable. Avoid permitting sensitive attributes like `is_admin`, `password_digest`, or foreign keys unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.
    *   **Consider alternative patterns:** For complex updates, use form objects or serializers to handle attribute assignment in a more controlled and explicit manner instead of relying solely on mass assignment.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. This is achieved by injecting code into data that is later displayed on the page without proper escaping.
*   **Rails Contribution:** While Rails provides automatic HTML escaping in ERB templates by default, developers can inadvertently bypass this escaping using methods like `raw`, `html_safe`, or by incorrectly using view helpers. This creates opportunities for XSS if user-provided data is not handled carefully in views.
*   **Example:** A comment form allows users to submit text. If the application displays these comments using `<%= @comment.content %>` without further sanitization and the user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will execute in the browsers of other users viewing the comment.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Embrace Rails' default escaping:** Rely on Rails' automatic HTML escaping as much as possible.
    *   **Escape user input in views:**  When displaying user-generated content, ensure it is properly escaped using methods like `html_escape` or Rails' default escaping mechanisms.
    *   **Be cautious with `raw` and `html_safe`:**  Avoid using `raw` and `html_safe` unless absolutely necessary and you are certain the content is safe. If you must use them, sanitize the data thoroughly before marking it as HTML safe.
    *   **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [3. Exposed Secrets in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/3__exposed_secrets_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, and other secrets are accidentally exposed, often through misconfigured servers, version control systems, or error pages.
*   **Rails Contribution:** Rails uses configuration files like `config/database.yml`, `config/secrets.yml`, and environment variables to manage application settings. If these files or environment configurations are not properly secured, secrets can be exposed.
*   **Example:** Database credentials stored in `config/database.yml` are committed to a public Git repository. Or, environment variables containing API keys are accidentally logged or exposed through server configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, compromise of external services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use environment variables for secrets:** Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of directly in configuration files.
    *   **Never commit secrets to version control:** Ensure that configuration files containing secrets are excluded from version control (e.g., using `.gitignore`).
    *   **Use encrypted credentials:** Utilize Rails' encrypted credentials feature to encrypt sensitive configuration data.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the deserialization of data. If untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation, it can lead to various attacks, including remote code execution.
*   **Rails Contribution:** Rails uses serialization for sessions, caching, and other purposes. While Rails defaults are generally secure, custom serialization implementations or older versions might be vulnerable if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts malicious serialized data and injects it into a session cookie. When the application deserializes this cookie, it executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid insecure serialization formats:** Be cautious when using serialization formats like `Marshal` in Ruby, especially with untrusted data. Consider using safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers when possible.
    *   **Use secure session storage:** Ensure session storage mechanisms are secure and prevent tampering. Rails' default cookie-based sessions with encryption and signing are generally secure if properly configured.
    *   **Validate deserialized data:** After deserializing data, validate its integrity and structure to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads.

## Attack Surface: [5. Development Mode Exposed in Production](./attack_surfaces/5__development_mode_exposed_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Rails application in development mode in a production environment. Development mode often enables features like verbose error messages, debug pages, and less strict security checks, which can expose sensitive information and create attack opportunities.
*   **Rails Contribution:** Rails has distinct environments (development, test, production) with different configurations. Misconfiguration or oversight can lead to running in development mode in production.
*   **Example:** A Rails application is deployed to production with `RAILS_ENV=development`. This exposes detailed error pages that reveal internal application paths and code structure to attackers.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, potential for denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always run in production mode in production:** Ensure the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` in production environments.
    *   **Disable debug features in production:** Configure Rails to disable debug features, verbose error logging, and development-specific middleware in production.
    *   **Configure appropriate error handling for production:** Implement custom error pages and logging for production that do not expose sensitive information.
