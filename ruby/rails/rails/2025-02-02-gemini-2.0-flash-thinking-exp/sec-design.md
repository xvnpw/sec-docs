# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Rails framework is an open-source web application framework written in Ruby. Its primary business goal is to enable developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently by providing conventions and tools that simplify common web development tasks.

- Business Priorities:
  - Developer productivity and efficiency.
  - Rapid application development and prototyping.
  - Maintainability and scalability of web applications.
  - A large and active community for support and contributions.
  - Stability and reliability of the framework.
  - Broad applicability across various web application domains.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread application security issues.
  - Lack of community support or decline in activity could hinder adoption and maintenance.
  - Performance bottlenecks in the framework could limit scalability for high-traffic applications.
  - Compatibility issues with evolving web technologies and standards.
  - Competition from other web frameworks could reduce market share and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of the Rails framework (described in Rails security policy and release notes).
  - security control: Active community and dedicated security team for reporting and patching vulnerabilities (described in Rails security policy).
  - security control: Built-in security features like CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, and protection against mass assignment vulnerabilities (documented in Rails security guide).
  - security control: Secure defaults for common configurations (e.g., cookie security settings, session management).
  - security control: Encouragement of secure coding practices through documentation and community guidelines (Rails documentation and best practices guides).
  - security control: Dependency management using Bundler to track and manage gem dependencies, including security updates (Bundler documentation).
  - security control: Automated testing framework to ensure code quality and identify potential vulnerabilities (Rails testing framework documentation).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party gems introduces potential supply chain vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration or misuse of Rails features by developers can lead to security weaknesses in applications.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed, potentially increasing the window for exploitation before patches are widely applied.
  - accepted risk: Rapid development cycles and feature additions may introduce new, unforeseen security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the Rails development and CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the framework code.
  - security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools to proactively identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party gems used by Rails.
  - security control: Enhance security awareness training for Rails developers and contributors, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities and secure coding practices specific to Rails.
  - security control: Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in Rails.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Rails applications should provide mechanisms for secure user authentication.
    - Requirement: Rails framework should not impose specific authentication methods but provide flexibility for developers to integrate various authentication strategies (e.g., username/password, OAuth, SAML).
    - Requirement: Rails should offer secure session management to maintain user authentication state.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Rails applications should implement robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Rails framework should provide tools and patterns for defining and enforcing authorization rules (e.g., policy objects, role-based access control).
    - Requirement: Authorization decisions should be consistently applied across the application.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Rails applications must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Rails framework should provide built-in validation helpers and mechanisms to simplify input validation.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Rails applications should use cryptography appropriately to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Requirement: Rails framework should provide secure cryptographic libraries and helpers for common tasks like password hashing, encryption, and digital signatures.
    - Requirement: Cryptographic keys should be managed securely and protected from unauthorized access.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Serving web application content and functionalities to users.
  - Processing user requests and data.
  - Managing user sessions and authentication.
  - Interacting with databases to store and retrieve data.
  - Providing APIs for external systems to interact with applications.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User data (e.g., personal information, credentials, session data): High sensitivity - requires confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Application data (e.g., business data, transactional data): Sensitivity depends on the application domain - may require confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Source code: Medium sensitivity - requires integrity and confidentiality to prevent unauthorized modifications and disclosure.
  - Configuration data: Medium to High sensitivity - requires confidentiality and integrity to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
  - Logs: Low to Medium sensitivity - requires integrity and availability for auditing and incident response.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - What are the specific compliance requirements for applications built with Rails? (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) - This would influence the required security controls.
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in the Rails framework and applications? - This would help prioritize security controls and risk mitigation strategies.

- Assumptions:
  - Rails framework is used to build general-purpose web applications.
  - Security is a high priority for applications built with Rails.
  - Applications built with Rails handle sensitive user and application data.
  - Deployment environment is assumed to be a cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and availability.
  - A modern CI/CD pipeline is used for building and deploying Rails applications, incorporating security checks.
