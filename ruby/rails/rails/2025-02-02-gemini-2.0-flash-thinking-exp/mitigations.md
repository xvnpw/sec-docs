# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rails/rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Strong Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_strong_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In each controller action that creates or updates a model (e.g., `create`, `update`), use `ActionController::Parameters` to access request parameters.
    2.  Call the `require` method on `params` to ensure the expected top-level key (usually the model name) is present. For example, `params.require(:user)`.
    3.  Chain the `permit` method to `require` to explicitly list the allowed attributes for mass assignment. For example, `params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password)`.
    4.  Only pass the permitted parameters to model creation or update methods (e.g., `User.new(permitted_params)`, `user.update(permitted_params)`).
    5.  Review all controllers and ensure this pattern is consistently applied for all model creation and update actions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Severity: **High**.  Attackers can potentially modify sensitive attributes (e.g., `is_admin`, `password_reset_token`) that were not intended to be user-modifiable, leading to privilege escalation or data breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** **High Risk Reduction**. Effectively eliminates the risk of unauthorized attribute modification through mass assignment when implemented correctly across all relevant controller actions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented**. Strong Parameters are generally used in newer controllers and actions developed in the last year.
    *   Implemented in: `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` (for `create` and `update` actions), `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb` (for `create` and `update` actions).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Older controllers and actions, particularly in legacy parts of the application, might still be using direct mass assignment without Strong Parameters.
    *   Missing in: `app/controllers/legacy_admin_controller.rb` (all actions), `app/controllers/profiles_controller.rb` (potentially in some update actions).
    *   Need to audit all controllers, especially those handling user input and model updates, to ensure consistent application of Strong Parameters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage ActiveRecord's Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_activerecord's_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When querying the database using ActiveRecord, always use the query interface methods like `where`, `find_by`, `update_all`, etc.
    2.  Pass user-provided input as arguments to these methods using placeholders (`?`) or hash conditions.
    3.  Avoid string interpolation or concatenation to build SQL queries with user input.
    4.  Example (Safe): `User.where("email = ?", params[:email])` or `User.where(email: params[:email])`
    5.  Example (Unsafe - Avoid): `User.where("email = '#{params[:email]}'")`
    6.  If raw SQL is absolutely necessary (highly discouraged), use `ActiveRecord::Base.sanitize_sql_array` or `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.quote` to escape user input, but prefer parameterized queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Severity: **Critical**.  Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, and potentially gain control of the database server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** **High Risk Reduction**. Parameterized queries are the most effective way to prevent SQL injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not executable code, by the database.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Largely Implemented**.  Developers are generally aware of parameterized queries and use ActiveRecord's query interface for most database interactions.
    *   Implemented in: Most model scopes, controller actions fetching data, background jobs interacting with the database.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potential for raw SQL usage in older parts of the application or in complex queries where developers might have resorted to string interpolation for convenience.
    *   Missing in:  Need to audit custom SQL queries in models, database migrations, and potentially some older reports or data processing scripts.
    *   Review any code that directly uses `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute` or similar raw SQL execution methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Rails' HTML Escaping and Sanitize User-Provided HTML](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_rails'_html_escaping_and_sanitize_user-provided_html.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **HTML Escaping:** Rely on Rails' default HTML escaping in ERB templates. Ensure you are not using `raw` or `html_safe` unnecessarily.
    2.  **HTML Sanitization (for user-provided HTML):** If you allow users to input HTML (e.g., in rich text editors):
        *   Use `Rails::Html::Sanitizer`.
        *   Configure the sanitizer to allow only a whitelist of safe HTML tags and attributes.
        *   Sanitize user input *before* storing it in the database or displaying it.
        *   Example: `@sanitized_content = Rails::Html::Sanitizer.safe_list_sanitizer.sanitize(params[:post][:content], tags: %w(p br strong em a), attributes: %w(href title))`.
    3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers using Rails configuration to further restrict the sources of content the browser is allowed to load.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Severity: **High**. XSS can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other malicious actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction**. HTML escaping mitigates many common XSS vectors. HTML sanitization is crucial for handling user-provided HTML. CSP provides an additional layer of defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented**. Rails' default HTML escaping is in use. Basic sanitization is applied in some areas where rich text input is allowed. CSP is not yet implemented.
    *   Implemented in: ERB templates across the application, sanitization in `app/models/post.rb` for content attribute.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP headers are not configured in the application.
    *   Sanitization might not be consistently applied across all areas where user-provided HTML is handled.
    *   Need to implement CSP headers in `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` or using a gem that configures Rails CSP.
    *   Audit all areas handling user input, especially rich text fields, to ensure proper sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure `protect_from_forgery` is Enabled and Handle AJAX Requests Correctly](./mitigation_strategies/ensure__protect_from_forgery__is_enabled_and_handle_ajax_requests_correctly.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CSRF Protection:** Verify that `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` (or `:null_session` for APIs) is present in `ApplicationController`.
    2.  **Use Form Helpers:**  Use Rails form helpers (`form_with`, `form_tag`) for all forms that modify data. These helpers automatically include the CSRF token.
    3.  **AJAX Requests:** For AJAX requests that modify data:
        *   Include the CSRF token in the request headers.
        *   Rails provides `csrf_meta_tags` helper to include the token in meta tags in the `<head>` section.
        *   JavaScript can read the token from these meta tags and include it in AJAX request headers (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`).
    4.  **Test CSRF Protection:** Regularly test forms and AJAX requests to ensure CSRF tokens are being generated and validated.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Severity: **High**. CSRF attacks can trick users into performing unintended actions on a web application while they are authenticated, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or transferring funds.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF Vulnerabilities:** **High Risk Reduction**. Rails' built-in CSRF protection, when correctly implemented, effectively prevents CSRF attacks for standard form submissions and AJAX requests.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Mostly Implemented**. `protect_from_forgery` is enabled in `ApplicationController`. Form helpers are generally used. AJAX CSRF handling is implemented for most new AJAX features.
    *   Implemented in: `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`, form helpers in views, JavaScript code for AJAX requests in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Older AJAX functionality might not be correctly handling CSRF tokens.
    *   Need to audit all AJAX requests that modify data to ensure they include the CSRF token in the headers.
    *   Review JavaScript code related to AJAX to confirm CSRF token inclusion.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Restrictive Routing and Avoid Exposing Internal Details](./mitigation_strategies/implement_restrictive_routing_and_avoid_exposing_internal_details.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrictive Routes:** Define routes in `config/routes.rb` that are as specific as possible and only expose necessary endpoints. Avoid wildcard routes or overly broad route definitions.
    2.  **UUIDs/Slugs in Routes:** Use UUIDs or slugs instead of sequential database IDs in URLs defined in `config/routes.rb` to obscure internal object references.
    3.  **Namespaced Routes:** Use namespaces in `config/routes.rb` to group routes for admin or sensitive areas, allowing for specific security configurations within Rails.
    4.  **Route Review:** Regularly review `config/routes.rb` to ensure routes are still necessary and properly secured within the Rails application context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (Indirect Mitigation):**
        *   Severity: **Medium**. Using UUIDs/slugs makes it harder to guess valid object IDs, indirectly mitigating IDOR risks.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**
        *   Severity: **Low to Medium**. Overly permissive routes or exposing internal details in routes can reveal information about the application's structure and functionality to attackers.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Indirect Mitigation):**
        *   Severity: **Medium**. Restrictive routing helps to limit the attack surface and reduce the potential for accidentally exposing unauthorized functionality within the Rails application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **IDOR, Information Disclosure, Unauthorized Access:** **Low to Medium Risk Reduction**. Restrictive routing and avoiding internal details in routes provide a layer of defense in depth and reduce the attack surface within the Rails application's routing structure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented**. Routes are generally RESTful and resource-based. UUIDs are used for some models, but not consistently in routes. Namespaces are used for admin areas.
    *   Implemented in: `config/routes.rb` (general routing structure), model definitions (for UUID usage in some models, but not always reflected in routes).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   UUIDs/slugs are not consistently used across all models in URLs defined in `config/routes.rb`.
    *   Route definitions in `config/routes.rb` might be more permissive than necessary in some areas.
    *   Need to review `config/routes.rb` and identify areas where routes can be made more restrictive and less revealing of internal details.
    *   Consider migrating to UUIDs or slugs for more models in URLs within `config/routes.rb` to enhance IDOR protection through routing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Session Cookies](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_session_cookies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Session Cookies Configuration:** In `config/initializers/session_store.rb` (Rails session configuration):
        *   Set `secure: true` option for session cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS (requires HTTPS to be enforced at the server level).
        *   Set `httponly: true` option to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, mitigating certain XSS attacks targeting session cookies.
        *   Consider using a more secure session storage mechanism like database-backed sessions or Redis (configurable in `session_store.rb`) for sensitive applications instead of the default cookie-based storage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:**
        *   Severity: **High**. Session hijacking allows attackers to steal a user's session cookie and impersonate them, gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.
    *   **Session Fixation:**
        *   Severity: **Medium**. Session fixation attacks can trick users into using a session ID controlled by the attacker.
    *   **XSS-based Session Cookie Theft (Mitigated by HttpOnly):**
        *   Severity: **Medium**. XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited to steal session cookies if they are accessible to JavaScript.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking and Fixation:** **High Risk Reduction**. Configuring secure session cookies with `secure: true` and `httponly: true` significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking and fixation attacks, and mitigates XSS-based cookie theft.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented**. `secure: true` and `httponly: true` are not explicitly set for session cookies in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`. Cookie-based session storage is used.
    *   Implemented in: Default Rails session management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `secure: true` and `httponly: true` options are not configured for session cookies in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`.
    *   Session storage mechanism is default cookie-based, which might not be optimal for highly sensitive data.
    *   Need to configure `secure` and `httponly` flags for session cookies in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`.
    *   Evaluate if a more secure session storage mechanism (database or Redis) is needed based on application sensitivity and configure it in `session_store.rb`.
