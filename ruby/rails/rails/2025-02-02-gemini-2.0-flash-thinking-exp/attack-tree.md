## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Bypassing Strong Parameters:
        *   Identifying unprotected attributes in Rails models.
        *   Manipulating request parameters to include these unprotected attributes.
        *   Directly targeting API endpoints which might have less strict parameter validation.
    *   Achieving Data Modification/Exfiltration:
        *   Successfully modifying sensitive data in the database through mass assignment.
        *   Exfiltrating sensitive information by manipulating attributes that control data visibility or access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Insecure Routing and Controller Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__insecure_routing_and_controller_logic__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Route Parameter Manipulation:
        *   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via route parameters:
            *   Exploiting predictable or sequential IDs in routes to access resources belonging to other users.
    *   Insecure Controller Actions:
        *   Lack of proper authentication/authorization in actions:
            *   Accessing controller actions without proper authentication checks (e.g., missing `before_action :authenticate_user!`).
            *   Bypassing authorization checks due to missing or flawed authorization logic in controller actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Vulnerabilities in Gems (Dependencies) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__vulnerabilities_in_gems__dependencies___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Outdated Gems with Known Vulnerabilities:
        *   Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated gems used by the Rails application.
        *   Common vulnerabilities include Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Insecure Session Management [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__insecure_session_management__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Insecure Session Storage:
        *   Default cookie-based sessions without proper security flags:
            *   Session hijacking due to missing `secure`, `httponly`, or `samesite` flags on session cookies.
        *   Session hijacking due to XSS or network sniffing:
            *   Exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to steal session cookies.
            *   Network sniffing (if HTTPS is not enforced) to intercept session cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_5__server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Unsafe use of template rendering methods:
        *   Rendering user-controlled input directly in templates without proper escaping.
        *   Using unsafe template rendering methods like `render inline:` with user-controlled input.
    *   Code execution via SSTI:
        *   Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server by injecting malicious code into template rendering processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.6. Insecure File Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_6__insecure_file_handling__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Unrestricted File Uploads:
        *   Lack of file type validation:
            *   Uploading malicious files (e.g., executable files) due to missing or weak file type validation.
    *   Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI):
        *   Vulnerable code that includes files based on user input:
            *   Exploiting code that dynamically includes files based on user-controlled input to read local files (LFI) or include remote files (RFI), potentially leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.7. Insecure Configuration and Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_7__insecure_configuration_and_deployment__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Debug Mode Enabled in Production:
        *   Information disclosure through verbose error pages and debugging information exposed in production.
    *   Exposed Development Tools/Environments:
        *   Accessing development tools (e.g., Rails console, web-console) left exposed in production environments.
    *   Insecure Deployment Practices:
        *   Using default credentials for servers or databases.
        *   Weak SSH keys or insecure SSH configurations.
    *   Information Disclosure via Error Pages or Logs:
        *   Leaking sensitive information (e.g., internal paths, database credentials, API keys) through verbose error pages or insufficiently secured logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Common Web Application Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_common_web_application_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Reflected XSS:
        *   Injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields that are reflected back to the user without proper escaping.
    *   Stored XSS:
        *   Storing malicious JavaScript code in the database (e.g., in user-generated content) that is executed when other users view the content.

*   **2.2. SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input:
        *   Injecting malicious SQL code into raw SQL queries that are constructed using unsanitized user input.

*   **2.3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Bypassing CSRF protection:
        *   Exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in CSRF protection mechanisms to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
