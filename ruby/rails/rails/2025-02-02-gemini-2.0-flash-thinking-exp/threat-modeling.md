# Threat Model Analysis for rails/rails

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious request parameters (e.g., in POST or PATCH requests) to modify object attributes that they should not have access to. They can potentially change sensitive data, escalate privileges (e.g., setting `is_admin=true`), or bypass intended application logic.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data corruption, business logic bypass.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** ActiveRecord Models, `strong_parameters`, `attr_accessible`, `attr_protected`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `strong_parameters` to define permitted parameters in controllers.
    *   Avoid using `attr_accessible` (deprecated) and carefully review `attr_protected` if used.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining permitted attributes.
    *   Implement input validation beyond parameter filtering.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via ActiveRecord](./threats/sql_injection_via_activerecord.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into database queries by manipulating user inputs. This can be achieved through raw SQL queries, unsafe interpolation in `find_by_sql` or `where` clauses, or dynamic column/table names. Successful injection allows attackers to read, modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access, denial of service, potential remote code execution on the database server.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** ActiveRecord, `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute`, `find_by_sql`, `where` clauses.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries with placeholders in ActiveRecord.
    *   Avoid raw SQL queries where possible.
    *   Never interpolate user input directly into SQL strings.
    *   Validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in queries.
    *   Use database users with least privileges.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via ERB/ActionView](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_erbactionview.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or HTML code into web pages viewed by other users. This is typically done by submitting malicious data that is then rendered on the page without proper escaping. Successful XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or execution of arbitrary actions in the user's browser context.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** ERB templates, ActionView helpers, `html_safe`, `raw`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on default escaping of user-provided content in ERB templates.
    *   Minimize the use of `html_safe` and `raw`, sanitize input before using them if necessary.
    *   Properly escape URLs and HTML attributes that include user input.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
    *   Validate and sanitize user inputs on the server-side.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on a web application without their consent. This is typically done by embedding malicious requests (e.g., forms or links) in a website or email controlled by the attacker. If successful, the attacker can perform actions as the victim user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or modifying data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, data manipulation, account compromise.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection, CSRF tokens, form helpers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled (default in Rails).
    *   Use Rails form helpers to automatically include CSRF tokens.
    *   Include CSRF tokens in AJAX requests that modify data.
    *   Validate CSRF tokens on the server-side (automatic in Rails).

## Threat: [Session Hijacking and Fixation](./threats/session_hijacking_and_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker steals or manipulates a user's session identifier (typically stored in a cookie) to gain unauthorized access to their account. Session hijacking involves stealing an existing valid session ID, while session fixation involves forcing a user to use a known session ID. Successful session hijacking allows the attacker to impersonate the victim user and access their account and data.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, identity theft.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** ActionDispatch::Session, Cookies, `session` object.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure session cookie settings (`secure: true`, `HttpOnly: true`).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all application traffic.
    *   Ensure strong and unpredictable session ID generation (default in Rails).
    *   Session regeneration after login (default in Rails).
    *   Implement session timeout and inactivity limits.
    *   Consider secure session storage options beyond cookie-based sessions.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Gems)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__gems_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in third-party gems used by the Rails application. Vulnerable gems can provide entry points for various attacks, including remote code execution, SQL injection, XSS, and more.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, and more.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** Gemfile, Bundler, all gems used by the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update gems using `bundle update`.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman`.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Rails and used gems.
    *   Review gem dependencies and transitive dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency management services for automated vulnerability scanning and updates.

## Threat: [Secret Key Exposure](./threats/secret_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `secret_key_base` used by Rails for cryptographic operations. Exposure can occur through various means, such as accidental commits to public repositories, insecure server configurations, or log files. With the secret key, attackers can forge session cookies, decrypt encrypted data, and bypass CSRF protection.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, session hijacking, data breach, CSRF bypass, data tampering.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** `config/secrets.yml`, `ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']`, ActionDispatch::Session, CSRF protection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never commit `secret_key_base` to version control.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management to store the secret key.
    *   Use strong and randomly generated secret keys.
    *   Restrict access to server configuration files.
    *   Consider periodic secret key rotation.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults and Configurations](./threats/insecure_defaults_and_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure default settings or configurations in Rails that are not suitable for production environments. This can include leaving debugging features enabled, using development-specific configurations in production, or not configuring secure cookie settings.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, increased attack surface, weakened security posture, potential for various attacks depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Affected Rails Component:** Rails configuration files (`config/environments/*.rb`, `config/initializers/*.rb`), default settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review and harden default Rails configurations for production.
    *   Disable debugging features and verbose error pages in production.
    *   Configure secure cookie settings explicitly in production.
    *   Ensure the application runs in the `production` environment in production deployments.
    *   Conduct regular security audits to identify misconfigurations.
