# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rails/rails

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strong_parameters.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strong Parameters

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your controller, for each action that creates or updates a model (e.g., `create`, `update`), define a private method (e.g., `user_params`).
    2.  Inside this method, use `params.require(:model_name).permit(:attribute1, :attribute2, ...)` to explicitly list the allowed attributes for mass assignment. Replace `:model_name` with the name of your model and list all permitted attributes that users are allowed to modify.
    3.  Use the defined parameter method (e.g., `user_params`) when creating or updating records in your controller actions (e.g., `User.new(user_params)`, `user.update(user_params)`).
    4.  Regularly review your controllers and models to ensure that only necessary attributes are permitted and that sensitive attributes are protected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability - Severity: High (Allows attackers to modify unauthorized attributes, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data breaches, or application compromise).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability - Impact: High (Effectively prevents unauthorized attribute modification through mass assignment when implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Strong Parameters are used in most newer controllers for core models like `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`. See `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`, `app/controllers/comments_controller.rb`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Strong Parameters are not consistently applied across all controllers, particularly in older parts of the application and in admin panels.  Need to review and implement in controllers for `Admin::ProductsController`, `Admin::SettingsController`, and ensure all models used in these controllers have corresponding strong parameter definitions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries with ActiveRecord](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_with_activerecord.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Parameterized Queries with ActiveRecord

*   **Description:**
    1.  When interacting with the database, primarily use ActiveRecord's query interface methods like `where`, `find_by`, `joins`, `update_all`, etc.
    2.  When using `where` conditions or similar methods that accept conditions, use placeholders (`?`) and pass user-provided values as separate arguments. ActiveRecord will automatically handle escaping and parameterization.
    3.  Avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating strings with user input.
    4.  If raw SQL queries are absolutely necessary (use sparingly), utilize `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute` with parameterized queries or prepared statements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection Vulnerability - Severity: High (Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise).

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection Vulnerability - Impact: High (Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection by ensuring user inputs are treated as data, not code, in database queries).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented. The development team generally uses ActiveRecord query interface for most database interactions. Code reviews emphasize using ActiveRecord methods over raw SQL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Occasional instances of raw SQL queries are still present, especially in older modules and complex reporting features. Need to conduct a codebase audit to identify and refactor these instances to use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord methods. Specific areas to check: `app/models/report.rb` and custom SQL scripts in `lib/tasks`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTML Escaping in Templates](./mitigation_strategies/html_escaping_in_templates.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: HTML Escaping in Templates

*   **Description:**
    1.  By default, Rails automatically escapes HTML output in ERB templates. Ensure you are relying on this default behavior.
    2.  When displaying user-generated content, output it directly in your templates without explicitly marking it as HTML safe unless absolutely necessary and after careful sanitization.
    3.  If you need to render HTML content that should *not* be escaped (e.g., from a rich text editor after sanitization), use the `html_safe` method or `raw` helper with extreme caution and only after thorough sanitization.
    4.  Avoid using `render html:` unless you are absolutely sure the content is safe and properly sanitized.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability - Severity: High (Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability - Impact: High (Effectively mitigates a large class of XSS vulnerabilities by preventing the browser from interpreting user-provided content as executable code).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented by default in Rails and generally followed by the development team. Templates primarily rely on default escaping.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Instances where developers might use `html_safe` or `raw` without proper sanitization need to be reviewed. Specifically, check areas where rich text editors are used and content is displayed. Need to implement server-side sanitization for rich text content before rendering it as `html_safe`. Missing sanitization logic in `app/helpers/application_helper.rb` where user bio is displayed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection Enabled](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_enabled.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: CSRF Protection Enabled

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` (or `:null_session`) is present and active in your `ApplicationController`. This is the default in new Rails applications, but verify it is not commented out or removed.
    2.  Use Rails form helpers (`form_with`, `form_tag`) in your views. These helpers automatically include the CSRF token in your forms.
    3.  For AJAX requests that modify data, ensure you are sending the CSRF token in the request headers (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`). Rails automatically includes this meta tag `<meta name="csrf-token" content="...">` in the layout, which JavaScript can access.
    4.  Do not disable CSRF protection unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason and have implemented alternative robust CSRF defenses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability - Severity: High (Allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, potentially leading to data modification, account compromise, or unauthorized transactions).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability - Impact: High (Effectively prevents CSRF attacks by ensuring that requests originating from the application are validated with a secret token).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Enabled in `ApplicationController` as per default Rails configuration. Form helpers are consistently used in views.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to verify that AJAX requests, especially in newer front-end components (using JavaScript frameworks), are correctly sending the CSRF token in headers.  Missing CSRF token handling in some AJAX calls in `app/assets/javascripts/admin_dashboard.js`. Need to update JavaScript code to include CSRF token in AJAX headers for all modifying requests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bundler Audit for Dependency Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/bundler_audit_for_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Bundler Audit for Dependency Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:**
    1.  Add the `bundler-audit` gem to your `Gemfile` in the `:development` and `:test` groups.
    2.  Run `bundle install` to install the gem.
    3.  Integrate `bundler-audit` into your development workflow by running `bundle audit` regularly before deployments and in your CI/CD pipeline.
    4.  Address any vulnerabilities reported by `bundler-audit` by updating vulnerable gems to patched versions or finding alternative secure gems.
    5.  Regularly update the `bundler-audit` database using `bundle audit update`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium to High (Vulnerable gems can introduce various security flaws, including XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution, and denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability and gem).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - Impact: Medium (Reduces the risk of using vulnerable gems by proactively identifying known vulnerabilities and prompting for updates. Impact depends on the severity of vulnerabilities in dependencies).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `bundler-audit` is included in the `Gemfile` and run manually by developers occasionally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `bundler-audit` is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Need to add a step in the CI/CD workflow to automatically run `bundle audit` and fail the build if vulnerabilities are found. Missing CI/CD integration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
