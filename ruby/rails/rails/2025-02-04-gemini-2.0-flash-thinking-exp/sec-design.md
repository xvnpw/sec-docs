# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To provide a robust, flexible, and productive web application framework for developers to build and deploy web applications efficiently.
 - Priority: Developer productivity and ease of use.
 - Priority: Stability and reliability of the framework.
 - Priority: Security and maintainability of applications built with the framework.
 - Priority: Community support and extensibility.
- Business Risks:
 - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread security issues in applications built using Rails, damaging reputation and trust.
 - Business Risk: Performance bottlenecks in the framework could limit the scalability and responsiveness of applications.
 - Business Risk: Lack of adoption or developer dissatisfaction could lead to decline in the framework's relevance and community support.
 - Business Risk: Breaking changes in new versions could cause significant upgrade challenges for existing applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Rails framework incorporates security best practices by default, such as protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, SQL injection, XSS). Described in Rails Security Guide and framework code.
 - security control: Regular security releases and patches are provided by the Rails core team. Communicated through Rails blog, security mailing lists, and GitHub release notes.
 - security control: A vulnerability reporting process is in place to allow security researchers and users to report potential issues privately. Described in Rails Security Guide and GitHub repository.
 - security control: Strong emphasis on secure defaults, encouraging developers to adopt secure coding practices. Documented in Rails guides and best practices.
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the codebase is publicly accessible, potentially allowing malicious actors to identify vulnerabilities before they are publicly disclosed and patched. Mitigation is through active community and core team security reviews and rapid patching.
 - accepted risk: Security of applications built with Rails ultimately depends on the developers using the framework securely. Rails provides tools and defaults, but misuse or misconfiguration can still lead to vulnerabilities. Mitigation is through comprehensive documentation, security guides, and community education.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the Rails framework CI pipeline to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Consider establishing a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Enhance security awareness training for core contributors and maintainers, focusing on secure coding practices and vulnerability management.
 - security control: Implement and enforce stricter code review processes with a security focus for all contributions to the framework.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Rails applications require robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. Rails provides built-in helpers and libraries (e.g., `has_secure_password`) to facilitate secure password management and session handling.
  - Requirement: Support for various authentication strategies, including username/password, multi-factor authentication, and integration with external identity providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML).
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Rails applications need fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to resources and actions. Framework provides tools and patterns for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).
  - Requirement: Ensure consistent authorization checks are applied across the application to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All user inputs must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, command injection). Rails provides built-in validation helpers and encourages strong parameter filtering.
  - Requirement: Implement both client-side and server-side validation to enhance security and user experience. Server-side validation is mandatory for security.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms. Rails provides libraries and helpers for encryption, hashing, and secure random number generation.
  - Requirement: Proper key management practices must be implemented to protect cryptographic keys from unauthorized access.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Critical Business Process: Development and maintenance of the Rails framework itself. This ensures the continued availability, stability, and security of the framework for its user base.
 - Critical Business Process: Distribution of the Rails framework to developers. Ensuring that the framework is accessible, and that distributed versions are authentic and untampered.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data: Rails framework source code.
  - Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are crucial. Unauthorized modifications or unavailability could severely impact the Rails ecosystem.
 - Data: Security vulnerability reports.
  - Sensitivity: Highly sensitive. Confidentiality is paramount to prevent exploitation before patches are released. Integrity is also critical to ensure accurate vulnerability information.
 - Data: Build artifacts (RubyGems, etc.).
  - Sensitivity: Integrity is crucial. Tampered artifacts could introduce malicious code into applications using Rails. Availability is important for developers to access and use the framework.
 - Data: Developer and contributor identities and access credentials.
  - Sensitivity: Confidential. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or access to sensitive systems.
