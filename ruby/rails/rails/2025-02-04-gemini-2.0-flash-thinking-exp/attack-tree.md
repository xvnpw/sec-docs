## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation/Sanitization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validationsanitization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This category represents a critical area because vulnerabilities here directly stem from how the application handles user-supplied data. Failure to properly validate and sanitize input leads to several high-risk attack paths.

    * **1.1. Mass Assignment Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate HTTP requests to modify model attributes they should not have access to, by exploiting Rails' mass assignment feature when `strong_parameters` are not correctly implemented.
        * **Impact:**  Account takeover, privilege escalation (e.g., setting `is_admin=true`), data modification, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    * **1.2. SQL Injection Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application inputs, which is then executed by the database. This is especially critical when using raw SQL queries or string interpolation in ActiveRecord queries without proper parameterization.
        * **Impact:** Data breach (access to entire database), data manipulation (modification or deletion of data), potential remote code execution on the database server in some scenarios.

        * **1.2.1. Exploit SQL Injection in ActiveRecord Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:**  Using string interpolation or `find_by_sql` without proper sanitization within ActiveRecord queries.

        * **1.2.2. Exploit SQL Injection in Raw SQL Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Directly executing raw SQL queries without using placeholders and parameter binding.

    * **1.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed in the browsers of other users. This occurs when user-provided data is rendered in web pages without proper output encoding.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover (session hijacking), defacement of web pages, redirection to malicious sites, phishing attacks, and information theft from users' browsers.

        * **1.3.1. Stored XSS in Database [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Malicious scripts are stored persistently in the database (e.g., in user profiles, comments) and executed when other users view the data.

        * **1.3.2. Reflected XSS via Parameter Handling [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Malicious scripts are injected in URLs or form parameters and executed when the server reflects the input back to the user in the response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Weaknesses in authentication and authorization controls are critical as they directly govern access to the application and its data.

    * **2.1. Insecure Authentication Implementation:**
        * **2.1.1. Weak Password Policies or Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Applications that allow weak passwords or use insecure password storage methods (e.g., weak hashing algorithms, no salting) are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and credential stuffing.
            * **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

    * **2.2. Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass authorization checks to access resources or perform actions they are not permitted to. This often stems from flaws in authorization logic or misconfigurations.

        * **2.2.1. Exploit Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Attackers directly manipulate object IDs in URLs or API requests to access resources without proper authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Secrets Management Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_secrets_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Improper handling of configurations and secrets can lead to complete application compromise, as secrets often protect access to critical resources and functionalities.

    * **3.1. Exposed Secrets [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Sensitive secrets like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys are exposed in insecure locations, making them accessible to attackers.

        * **3.1.1. Retrieve Secrets from Version Control (e.g., .env files) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Secrets are accidentally committed to version control systems (like Git), making them accessible in repository history.

        * **3.1.2. Access Secrets via Debug Pages or Error Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Debug pages or detailed error messages in production environments inadvertently reveal secrets.

        * **3.1.3. Exploit Insecure Storage of Secrets (e.g., Hardcoded) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Secrets are hardcoded directly in the application code or stored in easily accessible configuration files.

    * **3.2. Insecure Default Configurations:**
        * **3.2.1. Exploit Default Secret Key Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Using the default Rails secret key (or a weak one) in production. This key is used for session signing and other security features.
            * **Impact:** Session hijacking, potential data decryption, and other attacks that rely on knowing the secret key.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Gems) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__gems___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* Rails applications heavily rely on external libraries (gems). Vulnerabilities in these gems can directly impact the application's security.

    * **4.1. Vulnerable Gem Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure gems used by the application.

        * **4.1.1. Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Gems [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Specific Vector:** Attackers identify publicly known vulnerabilities in gems used by the application and exploit them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Development and Deployment Practices](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_development_and_deployment_practices.md)

* **5.1. Insecure Deployment Practices [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **5.1.1. Exploit Misconfigured Server or Infrastructure Components [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache), operating systems, firewalls, or cloud infrastructure components used to deploy the Rails application.
            * **Impact:** Variable, ranging from information disclosure (e.g., directory listing) to server compromise (e.g., exploiting unpatched services, weak access controls).
