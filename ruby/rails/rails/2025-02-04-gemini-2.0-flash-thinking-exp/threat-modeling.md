# Threat Model Analysis for rails/rails

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit Rails' mass assignment feature to modify model attributes they shouldn't. By crafting malicious request parameters, they can alter sensitive data like user roles or administrative flags, leading to privilege escalation or data manipulation. This is achieved by including unexpected attribute names in POST/PUT/PATCH requests, bypassing intended access controls.
**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, unauthorized access, business logic bypass.
**Rails Component Affected:** Active Record, Controller (Strong Parameters)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Strong Parameters to explicitly permit only expected attributes in controller actions.
*   Avoid using `attr_accessible` or `attr_protected` (older Rails versions); migrate to Strong Parameters.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining permitted attributes.
*   Implement input validation on permitted attributes to enforce data integrity.

## Threat: [SQL Injection (Active Record Context)](./threats/sql_injection__active_record_context_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through user-controlled input used in database queries within a Rails application. By manipulating input fields that are incorporated into raw SQL queries, dynamic finders, or complex `where` clauses without proper sanitization, they can bypass application logic, retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or potentially compromise the database server.
**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service, potential database server compromise.
**Rails Component Affected:** Active Record, Database Adapter
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize parameterized queries provided by Active Record's query interface for all database interactions.
*   Minimize or eliminate the use of raw SQL queries (`ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute`).
*   If raw SQL is necessary, rigorously sanitize and escape user input before incorporating it into queries.
*   Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via ActiveRecord Associations](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__via_activerecord_associations.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate object IDs in URLs or API requests to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify. In Rails applications, this often occurs when accessing resources through ActiveRecord associations without proper authorization checks. By manipulating IDs in routes like `/users/:user_id/posts/:post_id`, attackers can bypass intended access controls and access data belonging to other users.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
**Rails Component Affected:** Active Record Associations, Routing, Controller Authorization
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authorization checks in controllers to verify user authorization before accessing resources, especially associated models.
*   Scope ActiveRecord associations to ensure users can only access their own related data.
*   Consider using UUIDs instead of sequential integer IDs for resources to make ID guessing more difficult.
*   Validate requested IDs to ensure they are in the expected format and range.

## Threat: [Exposure of Debug/Development Routes in Production](./threats/exposure_of_debugdevelopment_routes_in_production.md)

**Description:** Development-specific routes and tools, such as the Web Console or debug pages, are unintentionally left enabled and accessible in production Rails environments. Attackers can exploit these to gain sensitive application information, execute arbitrary code (via Web Console), or cause denial of service.
**Impact:** Information disclosure, remote code execution (with Web Console), denial of service, application instability.
**Rails Component Affected:** Rails Configuration, Routing, Development Gems (e.g., Web Console)
**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on exposed tools)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable development-specific gems (like Web Console, better_errors) in production using `group :development` in the `Gemfile`.
*   Configure Rails to disable debug features and development routes in production environments (`config.consider_all_requests_local = false`).
*   Thoroughly review `config/routes.rb` to ensure no development-specific routes are exposed in production.
*   Regularly audit application configuration and dependencies to prevent accidental exposure of development tools.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via ERB/Template Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_erbtemplate_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into user-provided data that is rendered in Rails views without proper escaping using ERB templates. When victims access the page, the injected script executes in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. This occurs when user input is directly embedded in ERB templates using `<%= %>` without proper escaping or when `raw` or `html_safe` are misused.
**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, malware distribution.
**Rails Component Affected:** Views (ERB Templates), Templating Engine
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rely on Rails' default HTML escaping in `<%= %>` for user-provided data.
*   Use the `html_escape` helper (or `h`) to explicitly escape user input in views.
*   Utilize the `sanitize` helper for controlled HTML formatting, allowing a limited set of safe tags and attributes.
*   Minimize or avoid using `raw` and `html_safe`; use them only when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the sources of content browsers are allowed to load.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (Less Common in Standard Rails, but Critical if Present)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti___less_common_in_standard_rails__but_critical_if_present_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template directives processed server-side by the Rails template engine. While less common in typical Rails applications, if user input is dangerously used to construct template paths or influence template rendering logic, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, granting attackers complete control.
**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
**Rails Component Affected:** Templating Engine, View Rendering, potentially Controller if template paths are dynamically generated.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly avoid using user input to dynamically construct template paths or filenames.
*   Treat template rendering logic as server-side code and protect it accordingly, avoiding direct user input influence.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to the template engine, limiting access to server-side resources from within templates.
*   Conduct regular security audits to identify and eliminate potential SSTI vulnerabilities, especially in complex template logic.

## Threat: [Insecure Secret Key/Credentials Management](./threats/insecure_secret_keycredentials_management.md)

**Description:** The Rails `secret_key_base` or other critical credentials (database passwords, API keys) are compromised or easily discovered. A compromised `secret_key_base` allows attackers to forge sessions, bypass CSRF protection, and decrypt encrypted data, leading to severe security breaches. Exposed database or API keys can result in data breaches and unauthorized access to external services. This risk arises from storing keys in version control, using default values, or employing insecure storage methods.
**Impact:** Session hijacking, CSRF bypass, data breach, unauthorized access to external services, account takeover.
**Rails Component Affected:** Rails Configuration, Session Management, CSRF Protection, Encryption
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate a strong, unique, and random `secret_key_base` for each environment, especially production.
*   Store `secret_key_base` and other credentials as environment variables, not in configuration files within version control.
*   Utilize secrets management tools like Vault or cloud provider secret managers for secure storage and access control.
*   Encrypt configuration files containing sensitive information when necessary.
*   Never commit secrets to version control; use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files like `.env` and credential-containing configuration files.
*   Implement regular key rotation for `secret_key_base` and other sensitive keys.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Settings (Session Cookies)](./threats/insecure_cookie_settings__session_cookies_.md)

**Description:** Rails session cookies are configured with insecure settings, making them vulnerable to interception, hijacking, or manipulation. Missing `secure` or `httpOnly` flags, insecure cookie names, or lack of encryption can expose session cookies to attacks, allowing session hijacking and unauthorized access.
**Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized access.
**Rails Component Affected:** Session Management, Cookie Handling
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Set `secure: true` in `config/initializers/session_store.rb` for production to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
*   Enable `httpOnly: true` to prevent client-side JavaScript access to session cookies, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking.
*   Use strong and unpredictable cookie names to make session cookie targeting harder.
*   Ensure session cookies are properly encrypted if using cookie-based sessions, especially for sensitive data.
*   Regularly review and update cookie settings to maintain security best practices.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Gem Dependencies)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__gem_dependencies_.md)

**Description:** Rails applications rely heavily on gems, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly compromise application security. Outdated or vulnerable gems introduce security flaws that attackers can exploit, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially including information disclosure, XSS, remote code execution, and denial of service.
**Rails Component Affected:** Gem Dependencies, Bundler
**Risk Severity:** Varies, but High to Critical for exploitable vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update gem dependencies using `bundle update`.
*   Utilize `bundle audit` to scan `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities in gem dependencies.
*   Integrate dependency scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines for automated vulnerability detection.
*   Monitor security advisories for Rails and popular gems to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
*   Establish a process for promptly patching vulnerable gems when updates are available.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Rails Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_rails_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Sensitive Rails configuration files, such as `config/database.yml`, `config/secrets.yml`, or `.env`, are accidentally exposed to public access. This reveals database credentials, API keys, `secret_key_base`, and other sensitive information, leading to severe security breaches. Exposure can occur due to misconfigured web servers, incorrect deployment practices, or accidental inclusion in public repositories.
**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to databases and external services, session hijacking, CSRF bypass.
**Rails Component Affected:** Rails Configuration, Deployment
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure web server configuration to prevent direct access to configuration files.
*   Store sensitive configuration files outside the web root directory.
*   Use `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files to version control.
*   Apply principle of least privilege to file permissions, restricting access to configuration files.
*   Regularly audit web server and application configurations to ensure sensitive files are not publicly accessible.

## Threat: [CSRF Protection Bypass (Misconfiguration or Rails Vulnerabilities)](./threats/csrf_protection_bypass__misconfiguration_or_rails_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** Rails' built-in CSRF protection is bypassed due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities within the Rails framework. This allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users by crafting malicious requests from external sites. Misconfigurations can include unintentionally disabling CSRF protection or vulnerabilities in Rails' CSRF token verification.
**Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, data manipulation, account takeover.
**Rails Component Affected:** CSRF Protection Middleware, Controller (`protect_from_forgery`)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure `protect_from_forgery` is enabled in `ApplicationController` to activate global CSRF protection.
*   Properly configure `protect_from_forgery` and understand its available options.
*   Keep Rails updated to patch any known CSRF-related vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly test CSRF protection to verify its effectiveness and prevent bypasses.
*   Avoid disabling CSRF protection unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the security implications.

## Threat: [Session Fixation/Hijacking (Rails Session Management)](./threats/session_fixationhijacking__rails_session_management_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can fixate a user's session ID or hijack an active session, enabling them to impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized account access. This can result from insecure session storage, failure to regenerate session IDs after authentication, or vulnerabilities in the session store implementation within Rails.
**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access, data breach, data manipulation.
**Rails Component Affected:** Session Management, Session Store
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize secure session storage mechanisms like database-backed sessions or encrypted cookie sessions.
*   Regenerate session IDs after successful user authentication using `reset_session` to prevent session fixation.
*   Configure secure cookie settings for session cookies, including `secure: true` and `httpOnly: true`.
*   Implement session timeouts to limit session lifespan and reduce hijacking opportunities.
*   Regularly audit session management implementation and configuration to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
