# Threat Model Analysis for rails/rails

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting code into user input fields or URL parameters that are not properly sanitized or parameterized. The application, leveraging Active Record components within Rails, then executes this malicious SQL against the database. This allows the attacker to bypass normal security controls and interact directly with the database.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches (accessing sensitive information), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation within the database, or even execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Affected Component:** `Active Record` (modules responsible for query construction, including methods like `where` when used with string interpolation or raw SQL execution).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or Active Record query interface methods with hash conditions.
    *   Avoid string interpolation or concatenation of user input directly into SQL queries.
    *   Utilize database user accounts with least privilege.
    *   Regularly review and audit database interactions.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters to update model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible or modifiable. This occurs when the `strong_parameters` feature within `ActionController` (part of Rails) is not correctly configured or is bypassed. The attacker can potentially modify sensitive data, elevate privileges, or bypass business logic.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of user profiles or settings, privilege escalation, bypassing access controls.
*   **Affected Component:** `Action Controller` (specifically, the `strong_parameters` feature).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define permitted parameters using `strong_parameters` in controllers.
    *   Review and audit parameter whitelists regularly.
    *   Consider using form objects or dedicated input objects to handle data transfer.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application's output, which is then executed in the browser of another user. This is often achieved by submitting malicious data that is later displayed without proper escaping by the `Action View` rendering engine. The attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the application.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, theft of sensitive information, defacement of the application, spreading malware.
*   **Affected Component:** `Action View` (specifically, the rendering engine and template helpers responsible for outputting data).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always escape output in views using Rails' built-in helpers like `h` or the `= ` ERB tag.
    *   Be particularly careful with user-generated content and data retrieved from external sources.
    *   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
    *   Sanitize user input where necessary (e.g., when allowing HTML formatting).

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the Rails framework manages user sessions. This could involve predictable session IDs, lack of session regeneration after login, or insecure default cookie attributes handled by `Action Dispatch`. The attacker can potentially hijack a user's session and gain unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.
*   **Affected Component:** `Action Dispatch` (specifically, the session middleware and cookie handling mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the `secret_key_base` is securely generated and kept secret.
    *   Configure secure and HTTP-only flags for session cookies.
    *   Regenerate the session ID after successful login using `reset_session`.
    *   Consider using secure session storage mechanisms.
    *   Implement session timeouts.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Attributes](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** If Active Record attributes are serialized (e.g., using `serialize`), a feature provided by Rails, and the deserialization process is not handled carefully, attackers might be able to inject malicious code during deserialization, leading to remote code execution. This is particularly relevant with older versions of Ruby and certain serialization formats.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.
*   **Affected Component:** `Active Record` (specifically, the `serialize` functionality).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid serializing sensitive data if possible.
    *   If serialization is necessary, ensure the deserialization process is secure and consider using safer serialization formats (like JSON).
    *   Keep the Ruby version and Rails framework updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Be cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.
