## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Achieve SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__critical_node__achieve_sql_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input fields or URL parameters to inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by the Rails application. If successful, this allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database, potentially leading to a full compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__achieve_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Rails application, which is then rendered in the browsers of other users. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Payload Executed in User's Browser:** This is the culmination of the XSS attack, where the injected malicious script runs in the victim's browser, leading to the intended malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__achieve_command_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input that is used in system calls made by the Rails application. By injecting malicious shell commands, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server's operating system, potentially gaining full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Achieve Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) via Routing](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__achieve_insecure_direct_object_references__idor__via_routing.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates resource IDs in URLs to access resources belonging to other users or entities. This occurs when the application relies solely on the resource ID in the route for authorization without proper verification of user permissions.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Bypass Authorization Checks:** This is the point where the attacker successfully circumvents the application's authorization mechanisms due to the IDOR vulnerability, gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates request parameters to update model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible. If `strong_parameters` are not used correctly, attackers can modify sensitive data or even escalate their privileges.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Modify Data Without Authorization:** This is the successful exploitation of the mass assignment vulnerability, leading to unauthorized modification of application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__achieve_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code into template engines used by the Rails application. If user-controlled input is directly rendered in templates without proper sanitization, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Session Fixation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__achieve_session_fixation.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker forces a user to use a specific, known session ID. After the user authenticates with this fixed session ID, the attacker can use the same session ID to impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Achieve Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__achieve_session_hijacking.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker obtains a valid session ID of a legitimate user, often through techniques like XSS or network sniffing (if HTTPS is not enforced). Once the session ID is obtained, the attacker can use it to impersonate the user and gain access to their account.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Use the Session ID to Impersonate the User:** This is the successful hijacking of the user's session, allowing the attacker to act as that user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_authentication_mechanisms.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits flaws in the application's authentication logic, such as weak password hashing or insecure password reset flows, to gain access without providing valid credentials.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Access Without Proper Credentials:** This is the successful bypass of the authentication system, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Authorization Checks](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_authorization_checks.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits flaws in the application's authorization logic, allowing them to access resources or perform actions that they are not supposed to be permitted to. This could involve missing checks or incorrect role assignments.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Access Resources or Perform Actions Without Proper Permissions:** This is the successful circumvention of the authorization system, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Access Sensitive Information via Exposed Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__critical_node__access_sensitive_information_via_exposed_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets. This can occur due to misconfigured web servers, accidentally committed secrets in version control, or other vulnerabilities. This direct access to sensitive information can lead to a full compromise of the application and its related systems.
