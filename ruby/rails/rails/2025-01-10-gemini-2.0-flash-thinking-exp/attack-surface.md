# Attack Surface Analysis for rails/rails

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can modify model attributes they should not have access to by manipulating request parameters.
    * **How Rails Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Active Record's default behavior allows setting model attributes directly from request parameters. Without explicit protection, any attribute can be potentially modified.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a POST request to create a user with parameters including `is_admin: true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if the `User` model isn't properly protected.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Utilize `strong_parameters` in controllers to explicitly permit only the attributes that can be set via mass assignment. Define a clear whitelist of allowed parameters.
        * **Developers:**  Avoid directly using `params` to update model attributes without filtering.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unescaped_output.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    * **How Rails Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Rails templates render content by default, and if user-provided data is not properly escaped before being displayed, it can be interpreted as executable code by the browser.
    * **Example:** A user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a comment form, and this is displayed on the page without escaping, causing the script to execute in other users' browsers.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Use Rails' built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `h` helper, `<%= %>` in ERB templates) by default.
        * **Developers:** Employ `sanitize` helper for allowing specific HTML tags while stripping potentially dangerous ones.
        * **Developers:** Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Unsafe Interpolation](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_or_unsafe_interpolation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
    * **How Rails Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While Active Record provides mechanisms to prevent SQL injection, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities by using raw SQL queries (e.g., `find_by_sql`) or unsafe string interpolation within query methods.
    * **Example:** A search functionality uses `User.where("name LIKE '#{params[:search]}' ")`, allowing an attacker to input `'; DROP TABLE users; --` in the search field, potentially deleting the entire users table.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by Active Record.
        * **Developers:** Avoid using raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary and ensure all user input is properly sanitized and escaped when used in raw SQL.
        * **Developers:** Utilize Active Record query interface methods which automatically handle escaping.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the web application.
    * **How Rails Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rails provides built-in CSRF protection, but developers must ensure it's enabled and correctly implemented for all state-changing requests. Misconfigurations or exceptions can leave the application vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious website containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable Rails application to transfer funds from the logged-in user's account.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, state changes on behalf of the victim.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in the `ApplicationController` (`protect_from_forgery with: :exception`).
        * **Developers:** Include the CSRF token in all forms using the `form_with` helper or manually adding the token.
        * **Developers:** For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Sessions or Caches](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_sessions_or_caches.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code or data through serialized objects stored in sessions or caches.
    * **How Rails Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rails uses serialization (often with Marshal by default) for storing session data in cookies and for caching. If the secret key is compromised or if vulnerable gems are used for serialization, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects.
    * **Example:** An attacker with knowledge of the secret key crafts a malicious serialized session object that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Ensure a strong and securely stored `secret_key_base`. Rotate it regularly.
        * **Developers:** Consider using alternative session stores that offer better security (e.g., `activerecord-session_store` with proper security measures).
        * **Developers:** Be cautious when using custom serialization formats and ensure they are not vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
