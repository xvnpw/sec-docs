Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `friendly_id` gem:

- **Threat:** Slug Collision Leading to Resource Access Issues
    - **Description:** Due to flaws in `friendly_id`'s slug generation logic or insufficient handling of concurrent resource creation, two different records are assigned the same slug. When the application attempts to retrieve a resource using this ambiguous slug, it may retrieve the wrong resource or fail to retrieve any resource at all.
    - **Impact:** Users being directed to the wrong content, inability to access specific resources, potential data corruption if actions intended for one resource are performed on another due to the shared slug.
    - **Affected Component:** `friendly_id`'s slug generator module, specifically the methods responsible for ensuring slug uniqueness (e.g., within `Slugged::Candidates` or custom slug generators).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure robust uniqueness validation is enforced at the database level (e.g., using a unique index on the slug column).
        - Implement retry mechanisms or alternative slug generation strategies within the `friendly_id` configuration when a collision is detected during record creation.
        - Consider using scoped slugs if the application's data model allows, to further ensure uniqueness within a specific context.
        - Thoroughly test slug generation under high concurrency to identify potential collision scenarios.

- **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Slug Content
    - **Description:** The application's slug generation logic, potentially through custom methods or configurations used with `friendly_id`, inadvertently includes sensitive or identifying information about the resource or the user who created it directly within the slug. This information becomes publicly accessible in the URL.
    - **Impact:** Exposure of personal data, business-sensitive information, or other confidential details that should not be publicly accessible. This could violate privacy regulations or provide attackers with valuable information for further attacks.
    - **Affected Component:** The application's code that defines the slug candidates or the custom slug generator used by `friendly_id`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Carefully review and sanitize any data used in the slug generation process. Avoid including personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data directly in the slug.
        - Use generic and non-revealing terms for slugs. If specific keywords are necessary, ensure they do not expose sensitive details.
        - If user input is used to generate slugs, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent the inclusion of sensitive information.
