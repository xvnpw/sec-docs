## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of Bourbon Mixins Leading to Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_bourbon_mixins_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers, while using Bourbon mixins to simplify CSS creation, might inadvertently generate CSS properties that introduce security vulnerabilities. This can stem from a lack of understanding of the underlying CSS implications or from combining mixins in unexpected ways.
    * **Includes:**
        * **Generate Unintended CSS Properties with Security Implications:** This sub-path focuses on the direct creation of exploitable CSS through mixin misuse.
            * **Overly Permissive Positioning (e.g., `position: fixed` abuse):**  Bourbon mixins related to positioning might be used to set `position: fixed` without proper constraints, allowing attackers to overlay critical UI elements for clickjacking or information hiding. (Impact: High, Likelihood: Medium)
            * **Unintended Z-index Manipulation:** Mixins affecting the `z-index` property could be used in a way that obscures or brings to the forefront UI elements maliciously, enabling clickjacking or denial-of-service by blocking interaction. (Impact: Medium, Likelihood: Medium)

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion via Bourbon-Generated CSS](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion_via_bourbon-generated_css.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers, by overusing or improperly combining Bourbon mixins, can generate CSS that is excessively complex or large. This can lead to resource exhaustion on the client-side, slowing down browser rendering and potentially causing a denial of service, especially for users with less powerful devices or slower connections.
    * **Includes:**
        * **Generating Excessively Complex CSS Selectors:** Misusing Bourbon mixins can result in deeply nested or overly specific CSS selectors, which require significant processing power by the browser to match and apply styles. (Impact: Medium, Likelihood: Medium)

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Unintended CSS Properties with Security Implications](./attack_tree_paths/generate_unintended_css_properties_with_security_implications.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path, this node represents the point where exploitable CSS is created through mixin misuse.
    * **Includes:**
        * **Overly Permissive Positioning (e.g., `position: fixed` abuse):** (Impact: High, Likelihood: Medium)
        * **Unintended Z-index Manipulation:** (Impact: Medium, Likelihood: Medium)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Browser-Specific CSS Parsing Differences](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_browser-specific_css_parsing_differences.md)

**Attack Vector:** While Bourbon aims to handle vendor prefixes, subtle differences in how various browsers parse and interpret the generated CSS can be exploited to create inconsistencies. Attackers can leverage these inconsistencies to bypass client-side validation or introduce rendering vulnerabilities specific to certain browser environments. (Impact: Medium to High, Likelihood: Low)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Sensitive Information through CSS Comments](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_sensitive_information_through_css_comments.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Developers might mistakenly include sensitive information (like API keys, internal URLs, or configuration details) within Sass comments. If the Sass compilation process doesn't properly strip these comments in the production environment, this information becomes directly accessible in the application's CSS files. (Impact: Critical, Likelihood: Very Low)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Bourbon Versions (Dependency Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_bourbon_versions__dependency_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Like any software dependency, specific versions of Bourbon might contain known security vulnerabilities. If the application uses an outdated version of Bourbon with publicly disclosed flaws, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * **Includes:**
        * **Using an Outdated Bourbon Version with Known Security Flaws:** This node represents the specific scenario where a vulnerable version of Bourbon is in use. (Impact: High to Critical, Likelihood: Low to Medium)
