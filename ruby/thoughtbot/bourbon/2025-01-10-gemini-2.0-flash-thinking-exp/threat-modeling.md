# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/bourbon

## Threat: [Malicious CSS Injection via Mixin Parameter Manipulation](./threats/malicious_css_injection_via_mixin_parameter_manipulation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker, by exploiting a vulnerability in the application's logic that allows them to control or influence the parameters passed to a Bourbon mixin, could inject malicious CSS code. Bourbon would then generate CSS based on this attacker-controlled input, leading to the execution of arbitrary styles on the user's browser. This could be used for UI defacement, phishing attacks by mimicking legitimate UI elements, or even subtle data exfiltration through CSS techniques (e.g., using `background-image` to send data to an attacker-controlled server).
- **Impact:**  UI defacement, successful phishing attacks leading to credential theft or other sensitive information disclosure, potential for subtle data exfiltration without user knowledge.
- **Affected Bourbon Component:** Mixins (specifically the way mixins process and utilize input parameters).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Strictly sanitize and validate all data** that is used as input to Bourbon mixins, especially if this data originates from user input, external APIs, or any untrusted source.
    - **Implement strong input validation** on the server-side and client-side to prevent attackers from injecting malicious strings into parameters.
    - **Regularly audit the application's code** to identify any potential injection points where attacker-controlled data could influence Bourbon mixin parameters.
    - **Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded, which can mitigate some forms of CSS injection.

## Threat: [Performance Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Generated CSS](./threats/performance_denial_of_service_via_resource-intensive_generated_css.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could craft specific input values or exploit usage patterns of Bourbon mixins that lead to the generation of extremely complex and resource-intensive CSS. When a user's browser attempts to render a page with this excessively complex CSS, it could lead to significant performance degradation, browser freezes, or even crashes, effectively causing a denial of service on the client-side. This is particularly relevant for mixins that involve complex calculations, animations, or generate a large number of style rules.
- **Impact:**  Severe performance degradation for users, browser crashes, denial of service impacting usability and accessibility.
- **Affected Bourbon Component:** Mixins (especially those related to grids, animations, transitions, or any mixin that performs complex calculations or generates numerous style rules).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Carefully review the documentation and implementation details of Bourbon mixins** to understand their performance implications.
    - **Avoid using overly complex or deeply nested mixin combinations** that could lead to exponential increases in CSS complexity.
    - **Profile and optimize the generated CSS** to identify performance bottlenecks. Use browser developer tools or dedicated CSS performance analysis tools.
    - **Implement safeguards to prevent users or external systems from triggering the generation of excessively complex CSS**, such as limiting input values or complexity.
    - **Test the application's performance on a range of devices and browsers**, especially those with limited resources.
