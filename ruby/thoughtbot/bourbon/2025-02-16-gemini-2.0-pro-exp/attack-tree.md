## Attack Tree Path: [[[1. Input Validation Issues]] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__1__input_validation_issues____critical_node_.md)

*   **[[1. Input Validation Issues]] (Critical Node):** This is the root cause of the most significant threat. Bourbon mixins and functions, like any code that accepts input, can be vulnerable if that input isn't properly handled.

    *   **Description:** The core issue is the lack of, or insufficient, sanitization or validation of user-provided data before it's used within Bourbon mixins or functions. This allows an attacker to inject malicious CSS code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High. Developers often overlook or underestimate the importance of input validation, especially in contexts they perceive as "safe" (like CSS).
    *   **Impact:** High. Successful CSS injection can lead to a variety of attacks, including website defacement, data exfiltration, phishing, and even browser crashes.
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium. Exploiting this vulnerability typically involves crafting malicious input strings. Tools and techniques for CSS injection are readily available.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of CSS syntax, how Sass variables are used, and common injection techniques.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful code review, input validation testing, and potentially monitoring of generated CSS. Obvious injections are easy to spot, but subtle ones can be hidden.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Unsanitized User Input to Mixins/Funcs (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1a__unsanitized_user_input_to_mixinsfuncs__critical_node_.md)

    *   **1a. Unsanitized User Input to Mixins/Funcs (Critical Node):** This is the specific mechanism of the vulnerability.

        *   **Description:** User-supplied data (e.g., from form fields, URL parameters, or even data stored in a database) is passed directly into a Bourbon mixin or function without being properly escaped or validated. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary CSS code.
        *   **Example:**
            ```scss
            // Vulnerable Sass code
            @mixin my-mixin($color) {
              .element {
                color: $color;
              }
            }

            // Attacker input (in a URL parameter, for example):
            // ?color=red;%20}body{background-image:url(http://attacker.com/evil.jpg);}%20/*

            // Resulting CSS (after Sass compilation):
            .element {
              color: red; } body{background-image:url(http://attacker.com/evil.jpg);} /*;
            }
            ```
            In this example, the attacker has injected a `background-image` property that applies to the entire `body`, potentially loading a malicious image or tracking the user.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (same as parent node).
        *   **Impact:** High (same as parent node).
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (same as parent node).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium (same as parent node).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (same as parent node).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[4. CSS Injection]] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__4__css_injection____critical_node_.md)

*   **[[4. CSS Injection]] (Critical Node):** This is the primary attack vector enabled by the input validation issues.

    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious CSS code into the application, typically by exploiting vulnerabilities in how user input is handled.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (directly tied to the likelihood of input validation issues).
    *   **Impact:** High. CSS injection can lead to:
        *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information using CSS selectors and properties.
        *   **Phishing:** Creating fake login forms or overlays.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - in older browsers:** Some older browsers had vulnerabilities that allowed CSS to execute JavaScript, effectively turning CSS injection into XSS. This is less common now, but still a consideration for legacy support.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crafting CSS that causes browser crashes or performance issues.
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [4a. Injecting Malicious CSS via Mixins (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/4a__injecting_malicious_css_via_mixins__critical_node_.md)

    *   **4a. Injecting Malicious CSS via Mixins (Critical Node):** This is the specific method of CSS injection leveraging Bourbon.

        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits the lack of input validation in Bourbon mixins to inject their malicious CSS. This is the most direct and likely path.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (same as parent node).
        *   **Impact:** High (same as parent node).
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (same as parent node).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium (same as parent node).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (same as parent node).
