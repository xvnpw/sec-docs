# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for thoughtbot/bourbon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates_and_auditing.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Regular Dependency Updates and Auditing**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Dependency Checking:** Integrate a tool like Dependabot, Renovate, or Snyk into the project's CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to scan the project's dependency files (e.g., `package.json`, `Gemfile`) for outdated packages, *specifically including Bourbon*. Set up notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for new Bourbon releases and security vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Scheduled Manual Checks:** Even with automation, establish a regular schedule (e.g., bi-weekly, monthly) for a developer to manually check for Bourbon updates using `npm outdated` (for Node.js projects) or `bundle outdated` (for Ruby projects), filtering for Bourbon.
    3.  **Changelog Review:** Before updating Bourbon, a developer *must* review the Bourbon changelog on GitHub. Look for entries mentioning "security," "fix," "vulnerability," or similar keywords. Prioritize updates addressing security concerns.
    4.  **Testing:** After updating Bourbon in a development environment, run a full suite of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure no regressions or unexpected behavior were introduced. Pay *very close attention* to areas using Bourbon mixins, as these are the points of interaction with the library.
    5.  **Version Pinning:** In the dependency file (e.g., `package.json`), pin the Bourbon version using a specific version number or a carefully considered semantic versioning range (e.g., `~7.3.0`). Avoid using `*` or overly broad ranges that could lead to unexpected major version upgrades.
    6. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools like `npm audit`, `bundle audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check, or Snyk into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure these tools to run automatically on every code commit and build, and ensure they specifically check Bourbon.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Versions (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older Bourbon versions could lead to CSS injection, potentially enabling XSS in specific scenarios, or denial-of-service (DoS) if a vulnerability allows for excessive resource consumption during compilation. This is the *primary* threat directly related to Bourbon.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High to Critical):** While less likely with a well-known library, a compromised Bourbon package could introduce malicious code. Regular updates and integrity checks reduce this risk *specifically for Bourbon*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known Bourbon vulnerabilities to near zero, *provided updates are applied promptly*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised Bourbon package.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automated dependency checking with Dependabot is configured for the `frontend-ui` repository, and it includes Bourbon.
    *   Manual checks are performed monthly by the lead frontend developer, focusing on frontend dependencies.
    *   Changelog review is part of the update procedure documented in the team's wiki.
    *   Basic unit tests cover some Bourbon mixin usage.
    *   Version pinning is used in `package.json` for Bourbon.
    *   `npm audit` is run as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and it checks Bourbon.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests are needed to specifically cover *all* areas where Bourbon mixins are used.  This is missing in the `legacy-styles` module.
    *   Snyk integration is planned but not yet implemented. This would provide more advanced vulnerability scanning and reporting, specifically for dependencies like Bourbon.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Mixin Usage and Input Validation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mixin_usage_and_input_validation.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Mixin Usage and Input Validation**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mixin Documentation Review:** Developers must thoroughly read and understand the Bourbon documentation for *every* Bourbon mixin used in the project. This includes understanding the generated CSS, potential side effects, and any limitations. This is *directly* related to secure use of the Bourbon library.
    2.  **Code Reviews:** All code using Bourbon mixins must undergo a code review. Reviewers should specifically check for:
        *   Correct usage of Bourbon mixins according to the official Bourbon documentation.
        *   Potential for unexpected CSS output *from the Bourbon mixins*.
        *   Any indirect influence of user-provided data on Bourbon mixin arguments.
    3.  **Indirect Input Validation:** Even though Bourbon doesn't directly handle user input, if *any* user-provided data influences the values passed to *Bourbon mixins* (e.g., through variables, calculations), that data *must* be rigorously validated and sanitized *before* it's used in the Sass compilation process. This is crucial because it prevents manipulation of Bourbon's output. This includes:
        *   Type checking (e.g., ensuring a value is a number, string, or valid color, as expected by the Bourbon mixin).
        *   Range checking (e.g., ensuring a font size is within acceptable limits, appropriate for the Bourbon mixin being used).
        *   Whitelist validation (e.g., allowing only specific values from a predefined list, if the Bourbon mixin expects a limited set of inputs).
        *   Escaping or encoding (if necessary, to prevent special characters from being misinterpreted by the Sass compiler or the Bourbon mixin).
    4.  **Avoid Dynamic Mixin Calls:** Do not use dynamic mixin calls (e.g., using string interpolation to construct mixin names) with *Bourbon mixins*, especially if user input influences the mixin name. This is a general Sass best practice, but it's crucial for security when using an external library like Bourbon.
    5. **Avoid `!important` Overuse:** Minimize the use of `!important` in the CSS, including the CSS generated by *Bourbon mixins*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CSS Injection (Severity: Medium to High):** Improper Bourbon mixin usage, especially when influenced by unsanitized user input, could lead to unexpected CSS output, potentially allowing for CSS injection. This is a direct consequence of how Bourbon is used.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** While less direct than typical XSS, CSS injection *could* be leveraged to inject malicious JavaScript in very specific and unusual circumstances (e.g., using CSS expressions or behaviors). This is an indirect, but possible, consequence of misusing Bourbon.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low to Medium):**  In rare cases, extremely complex or malformed CSS generated due to improper Bourbon mixin usage could cause performance issues in the browser or during Sass compilation. This is directly related to the output of Bourbon.
        *   **Styling-Based Attacks (Severity: Low to Medium):** Overuse of `!important` can make it harder to override styles, potentially hindering security fixes or making the application more susceptible to certain types of styling-based attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSS Injection/XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of CSS injection and indirect XSS by ensuring proper Bourbon mixin usage and input validation that affects Bourbon's output.
    *   **DoS:** Minimizes the likelihood of performance issues caused by malformed CSS generated by Bourbon.
    * **Styling-Based Attacks:** Improves the maintainability and security of the CSS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code reviews are mandatory for all pull requests, and reviewers are expected to check Bourbon mixin usage.
    *   Basic input validation is performed on user-provided data in the backend API, but its connection to Bourbon mixin usage is not explicitly checked.
    *   Developers are generally aware of the need to avoid dynamic mixin calls, especially with Bourbon.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal guidelines and training on secure Bourbon mixin usage are needed for the development team. This should be Bourbon-specific training.
    *   More rigorous input validation is required in the frontend components that handle user input that indirectly affects CSS generated by Bourbon (e.g., the `theme-customizer` component). The validation logic needs to be explicitly tied to the expected inputs of the Bourbon mixins.
    *   A linter configuration to discourage overuse of `!important` within the context of Bourbon-generated CSS is not yet in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Third-Party Addon Management (If Applicable, and Directly Related to Bourbon)](./mitigation_strategies/third-party_addon_management__if_applicable__and_directly_related_to_bourbon_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Third-Party Addon Management (If Applicable, and Directly Related to Bourbon)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** Create and maintain a list of all third-party Sass files or libraries that *specifically extend or modify Bourbon's functionality*. This is crucial for tracking Bourbon-related dependencies.
    2.  **Vetting:** Before using any third-party addon *for Bourbon*, thoroughly vet the code for security vulnerabilities.  Examine the source code, check for known issues, and assess the reputation of the author/maintainer. This is directly related to the security of Bourbon extensions.
    3.  **Dependency Management:** Treat third-party addons *for Bourbon* as separate dependencies.  Include them in your project's dependency management system (e.g., npm, yarn) and pin their versions.
    4.  **Regular Updates:** Just like Bourbon itself, regularly update third-party addons *that interact with Bourbon* to the latest stable versions.  Follow the same update and testing procedures as for Bourbon.
    5.  **Minimize Usage:** If possible, avoid using third-party addons *for Bourbon*.  If the required functionality can be achieved with standard Bourbon mixins or custom Sass code, prefer that approach. This reduces reliance on external code that might affect Bourbon.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Code (Severity: Variable, depending on the addon):**  Third-party addons *specifically designed for Bourbon* could contain their own vulnerabilities, unrelated to Bourbon itself, but impacting its use.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):**  A compromised third-party addon *for Bourbon* could introduce malicious code into the project, potentially affecting Bourbon's behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through third-party code that interacts with Bourbon.
    *   Improves the overall security posture of the project by limiting the attack surface related to Bourbon.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project currently does *not* use any third-party Bourbon addons.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal policy prohibiting the use of unvetted third-party Bourbon addons should be documented. This policy should explicitly mention Bourbon.
