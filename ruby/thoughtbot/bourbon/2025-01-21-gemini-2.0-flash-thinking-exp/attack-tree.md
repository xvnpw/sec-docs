## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Bourbon [CRITICAL NODE: Entry Point for Bourbon-Specific Attacks]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_bourbon__critical_node_entry_point_for_bourbon-specific_attacks_.md)

**Description:** This is the overarching goal and represents any successful compromise of the application specifically through vulnerabilities related to the Bourbon library. It's critical because it's the starting point for all the Bourbon-specific attack vectors.
**Why it's Critical:**  Focusing on this node ensures that all vulnerabilities stemming from Bourbon usage are considered and addressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities Introduced by Bourbon's Generated CSS -> This CSS is Interpreted by the Browser to Cause Harm -> CSS Injection leading to XSS [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: XSS Vulnerability]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_bourbon's_generated_css_-_this_css_is_interpreted_by_the_brows_cc6f62fe.md)

**Description:** This path involves an attacker exploiting a scenario where Bourbon generates CSS that, when combined with an application vulnerability (or lack of proper sanitization), allows for the injection of malicious CSS. This injected CSS can then be interpreted by the browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Why it's High-Risk:**
    * **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities can have a severe impact, allowing attackers to steal user credentials, perform actions on behalf of users, and deface websites.
    * **Plausibility:** While the likelihood of Bourbon directly generating *obviously* malicious CSS is low, subtle issues combined with application weaknesses can create this vulnerability.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
    * Ensure proper output encoding and sanitization of any user-controlled data that might influence the generated CSS or be rendered alongside it.
    * Regularly review the generated CSS for any unexpected or potentially harmful patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on Bourbon Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: Supply Chain Compromise]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_bourbon_dependency__high_risk_path___critical_node_supply_chain_compromise_.md)

**Description:** This path involves an attacker compromising the Bourbon package on a public registry (like npm or RubyGems) and injecting malicious code. If the target application includes this compromised version of Bourbon, the malicious code can be executed within the application's context.
**Why it's High-Risk:**
    * **Impact:** A successful supply chain attack can have a critical impact, potentially allowing attackers to gain full control of the application and its data.
    * **Widespread Impact:** Because Bourbon is a widely used library, a compromise could affect numerous applications.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement dependency pinning to ensure that specific, trusted versions of Bourbon are used.
    * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    * Consider using a private registry for dependencies to have more control over the source of packages.
    * Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) if using Bourbon from a CDN.

## Attack Tree Path: [Developer Misuse of Bourbon Features Leading to Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/developer_misuse_of_bourbon_features_leading_to_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path highlights the risk of developers using Bourbon's features in unintended or insecure ways, leading to vulnerabilities in the application.
**Why it's High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Developer errors are a common source of vulnerabilities.
    * **Varied Impact:** The impact can range from low (minor styling issues) to high (information disclosure or even XSS, as seen in the next sub-path).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Provide comprehensive developer training on secure coding practices and the potential security implications of using CSS libraries.
    * Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on Sass and CSS code, to identify potential misuses of Bourbon features.
    * Enforce consistent styling practices and use linters to catch potential issues early.

## Attack Tree Path: [Developer Misuse of Bourbon Features Leading to Vulnerabilities -> This Misuse Creates a Vulnerability in the Application -> Abuse of `content` property for malicious purposes (e.g., injecting scripts) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/developer_misuse_of_bourbon_features_leading_to_vulnerabilities_-_this_misuse_creates_a_vulnerabilit_75a98730.md)

**Description:** This is a specific example of developer misuse where the `content` property in CSS (often used with pseudo-elements) is abused to inject malicious content, potentially including attempts to inject scripts.
**Why it's High-Risk:**
    * **Potential for XSS:** While browser security measures often prevent direct script execution via `content`, clever attackers might find ways to bypass these protections or use it for other malicious purposes.
    * **Ease of Misuse:** The `content` property is relatively easy to use, making accidental or intentional misuse a possibility.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Educate developers on the security implications of using the `content` property and when it's appropriate.
    * Implement CSP to mitigate the impact of any successful script injection.
    * Carefully review code that uses the `content` property, especially when it involves dynamic content or user input.
