# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/bourbon

## Threat: [Compromised Bourbon Dependency](./threats/compromised_bourbon_dependency.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the official Bourbon repository or a widely used mirror. They inject malicious code, such as altered mixins or additional stylesheets, directly into the Bourbon library. When developers install or update Bourbon, they unknowingly include this malicious code in their project.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Visual Defacement:** The attacker can manipulate the application's styling to display misleading or harmful content, damaging the application's reputation or tricking users.
        *   **Clickjacking:** Malicious CSS within Bourbon can be used to overlay invisible elements on top of legitimate UI components, tricking users into performing unintended actions.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Indirect):**  Cleverly crafted CSS within Bourbon can sometimes be used to infer information about the user's environment or actions through techniques like timing attacks or by exploiting browser behavior.
    *   **Bourbon Component Affected:** The entire library, specifically the core mixins and potentially any added stylesheets or functions within the Bourbon repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Verify Source Integrity:**  Always verify the integrity of the Bourbon library source using checksums or by comparing against known good versions.
        *   **Pin Dependencies:**  Use dependency management tools to pin specific versions of Bourbon and avoid automatic updates that might introduce compromised code.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories related to Bourbon.
        *   **Consider Private Repositories:** For sensitive projects, consider hosting a private, vetted copy of the Bourbon library.

## Threat: [Malicious Functionality Introduced via Bourbon Update](./threats/malicious_functionality_introduced_via_bourbon_update.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate update to the Bourbon library, either intentionally malicious by a compromised maintainer account or unintentionally through a vulnerability introduced by a contributor, includes new mixins or modifies existing ones to contain malicious CSS or logic.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to a compromised dependency, leading to visual defacement, clickjacking, or indirect information disclosure directly through the officially distributed Bourbon library.
    *   **Bourbon Component Affected:**  Specific mixins or functions within the Bourbon library that are added or modified in the malicious update.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Bourbon Release Notes:** Carefully review release notes and changelogs for any unexpected or suspicious changes before updating Bourbon.
        *   **Test Updates in a Non-Production Environment:** Thoroughly test Bourbon updates in a staging or development environment before deploying them to production.
        *   **Code Review of Updates:** For critical applications, consider performing a code review of the changes introduced in Bourbon updates.
        *   **Community Monitoring:**  Stay engaged with the Bourbon community and monitor for discussions about potential issues or unexpected behavior in new releases.
