## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mixins or Functions (Supply Chain Risk)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mixins_or_functions__supply_chain_risk_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Mixins or Functions (Supply Chain Risk)

    * **Description:** A compromised or malicious version of the Bourbon library (e.g., through a supply chain attack on package managers) introduces mixins or functions that generate malicious CSS.
    * **How Bourbon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The malicious code resides directly within the Bourbon library's mixins and functions, making Bourbon the vehicle for injecting harmful CSS into the application's stylesheets.
    * **Example:** A compromised Bourbon mixin could generate CSS that exploits browser vulnerabilities, performs cross-site scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious content through CSS properties, or alters the application's appearance to facilitate phishing attacks.
    * **Impact:** Client-side attacks, including XSS, phishing, and potentially browser-based exploits, directly stemming from the malicious CSS generated by Bourbon.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Obtain Bourbon from trusted and official sources.
        * Verify the integrity of the Bourbon package using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official repository.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect potentially malicious or compromised dependencies.
        * Consider using a dependency firewall to control which external packages can be used in the project.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Usage Leading to Unexpected CSS Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_usage_leading_to_unexpected_css_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Incorrect Usage Leading to Unexpected CSS Vulnerabilities

    * **Description:** Developers misuse Bourbon mixins or functions in ways that unintentionally generate CSS with security implications.
    * **How Bourbon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Bourbon provides the mixins and functions that, when used incorrectly, produce the vulnerable CSS. The vulnerability arises directly from how Bourbon's features are applied.
    * **Example:** Using a Bourbon mixin to dynamically generate `url()` values for background images or other resources based on unsanitized user input. This allows an attacker to control the generated URL, potentially leading to open redirects or information disclosure. The vulnerability is a direct consequence of using Bourbon's features with untrusted data.
    * **Impact:** Open redirects, information disclosure, or other client-side vulnerabilities directly caused by the unexpected CSS generated through incorrect Bourbon usage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement thorough code reviews specifically focusing on how Bourbon mixins are used, especially when handling user-provided data or dynamic content.
        * Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for any data used in conjunction with Bourbon mixins that generate URLs or other potentially sensitive CSS properties.
        * Utilize CSS linters and security analysis tools to scan the generated CSS for potential vulnerabilities arising from Bourbon usage.
        * Provide developers with comprehensive training and guidelines on secure Bourbon usage patterns and potential pitfalls.
