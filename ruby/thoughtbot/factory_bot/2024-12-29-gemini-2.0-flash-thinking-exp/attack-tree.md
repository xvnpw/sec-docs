## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes for Application Using FactoryBot

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the FactoryBot library or its usage.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via FactoryBot [CRITICAL]
*   Inject Malicious Data via Factories [CRITICAL]
    *   Exploit Factory Definition Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
        *   **Code Injection in Factory Definitions**
    *   **Exploit Attribute Assignment Vulnerabilities** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Unsafe Attribute Assignment**
    *   **Exploit Callback Vulnerabilities** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Malicious Code in Callbacks**
*   Abuse FactoryBot in Non-Test Environments (Misconfiguration) [CRITICAL]
    *   FactoryBot Enabled in Production or Staging [CRITICAL]
        *   Use Factories to Create or Modify Data in Live Environments [CRITICAL]
            *   **Data Corruption**
            *   **Unauthorized Data Access/Modification**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Compromise Application via FactoryBot**

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, encompassing all potential methods of exploiting FactoryBot.

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data via Factories**

*   Attackers aim to inject harmful data into the application through the factory creation process. This can be achieved by manipulating factory definitions, attribute assignments, or callbacks.

**Critical Node: Exploit Factory Definition Vulnerabilities**

*   Attackers target weaknesses in how factory definitions are loaded or processed to inject malicious code or logic.

**High-Risk Path: Code Injection in Factory Definitions**

*   An attacker supplies a malicious factory definition. This could occur if:
    *   Factory definitions are dynamically loaded from an untrusted source.
    *   A templating engine used in factory definitions has vulnerabilities allowing code injection.
    *   A dependency providing factory definitions is compromised.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server during the test setup or, in cases of misconfiguration, in other environments.

**Critical Node: Exploit Attribute Assignment Vulnerabilities**

*   Attackers exploit how attributes are assigned in factories to inject malicious payloads.

**High-Risk Path: Unsafe Attribute Assignment**

*   Factory-generated attributes are used directly in application code without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If factory attributes are used in raw SQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If factory attributes are rendered in web views, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers.

**Critical Node: Exploit Callback Vulnerabilities**

*   Attackers target the callback mechanisms within FactoryBot to execute malicious code.

**High-Risk Path: Malicious Code in Callbacks**

*   An attacker injects malicious code into factory callbacks. This can happen if:
    *   Callbacks are dynamically defined or loaded from untrusted sources.
    *   The logic within callbacks is not carefully reviewed and allows for injection.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server during object creation.

**Critical Node: Abuse FactoryBot in Non-Test Environments (Misconfiguration)**

*   This critical node represents the significant risk of FactoryBot being enabled and usable in production or staging environments, which is a severe misconfiguration.

**Critical Node: FactoryBot Enabled in Production or Staging**

*   Due to misconfiguration, the FactoryBot library is included and active in a live environment (production or staging).

**Critical Node: Use Factories to Create or Modify Data in Live Environments**

*   With FactoryBot active in a live environment, an attacker finds a way to trigger the creation or modification of data using factories. This could be through:
    *   Accidental exposure of routes or code paths intended for testing.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in application code that incorrectly uses FactoryBot logic.

**High-Risk Path: Data Corruption**

*   An attacker uses factories in a live environment to create or modify data in a way that corrupts the application's data integrity. This could involve creating invalid records, overwriting existing data with incorrect values, or disrupting relationships between data entities.

**High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Data Access/Modification**

*   An attacker uses factories in a live environment to create new user accounts with elevated privileges, modify existing user permissions, or access sensitive data that they should not have access to. This bypasses normal application security controls.
