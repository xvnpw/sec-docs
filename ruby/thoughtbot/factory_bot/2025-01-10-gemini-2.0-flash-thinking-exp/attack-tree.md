## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FactoryBot Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_factorybot_exploitation.md)

The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective by leveraging weaknesses related to FactoryBot.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Factory Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_factory_definitions.md)

This represents a category of attacks that target the way FactoryBot definitions are written. It's critical because flaws here can directly lead to code execution or data exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Callbacks](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_callbacks.md)

This path involves an attacker exploiting the ability to define callbacks in FactoryBot to inject and execute malicious code within the application's context during test execution or, in a severe misconfiguration, potentially beyond. This is high-risk due to the potential for full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Define Factory with Unsafe Callback Logic](./attack_tree_paths/define_factory_with_unsafe_callback_logic.md)

This specific node is critical because it highlights the danger of executing arbitrary code within FactoryBot callbacks, potentially leading to code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Define Factories with Insecure Default Values](./attack_tree_paths/define_factories_with_insecure_default_values.md)

This node is critical because it represents a common developer mistake that can directly expose sensitive information.

This path represents the risk of developers inadvertently including sensitive information (like credentials) directly within factory definitions. This is high-risk because it provides a direct route to compromising sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Include Hardcoded Credentials or Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/include_hardcoded_credentials_or_sensitive_data.md)

This is a highly critical node as it represents a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability where sensitive information is directly embedded in the code.

This specific path within insecure default values is high-risk due to the ease of exploitation and the immediate access to sensitive information it grants an attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Factory Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_factory_attributes.md)

This node is critical because it highlights a more sophisticated vulnerability where insecure deserialization can lead to code execution or data manipulation.

This path involves exploiting insecure deserialization practices within factory attributes to inject malicious payloads, potentially leading to code execution. This is high-risk due to the severity of the potential impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Define Factory Attributes with Unsafe Deserialization Logic](./attack_tree_paths/define_factory_attributes_with_unsafe_deserialization_logic.md)

This node is critical because it highlights a more sophisticated vulnerability where insecure deserialization can lead to code execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Factory Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_factory_usage.md)

This category of attacks focuses on how FactoryBot is used within the application's testing and development lifecycle. It's critical because misuse can have significant security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leftover Test Data in Production](./attack_tree_paths/leftover_test_data_in_production.md)

This path encompasses scenarios where data generated by FactoryBot for testing purposes ends up in the production environment. This is high-risk because it can lead to data inconsistencies, exposure of test data, or even the execution of test-related code in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accidental Execution of Test Code in Production Environment](./attack_tree_paths/accidental_execution_of_test_code_in_production_environment.md)

This is a critical node representing a severe deployment error that can have catastrophic consequences.

This specific path within leftover test data is high-risk due to the potential for unpredictable and catastrophic consequences if test code, including factory usage, runs in the live environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Migration of Test Database or Data to Production](./attack_tree_paths/migration_of_test_database_or_data_to_production.md)

This path within leftover test data is high-risk because it can directly expose sensitive test data or create inconsistencies in the production database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Verbose Test Output](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_verbose_test_output.md)

This path represents the risk of sensitive data generated by factories being inadvertently exposed in test logs or error messages. This is high-risk as it can lead to data breaches through easily accessible logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks in Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks_in_test_environment.md)

This path involves using FactoryBot to create entities or trigger application states in tests that bypass normal security validation. This is high-risk because it can mask vulnerabilities that are present in production or create exploitable states.

## Attack Tree Path: [Factories Used to Create Users or Entities Bypassing Normal Validation](./attack_tree_paths/factories_used_to_create_users_or_entities_bypassing_normal_validation.md)

This node is critical because it demonstrates how FactoryBot can be misused to create application states that would not be possible under normal circumstances, potentially bypassing security checks.

This specific path within bypassing security checks is high-risk because it allows for the creation of invalid or insecure entities that could be exploited if such states were to occur in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of FactoryBot](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_factorybot.md)

This node is critical because it highlights the risk of inheriting vulnerabilities from third-party libraries used by FactoryBot.

This path represents the risk of vulnerabilities existing within the libraries that FactoryBot relies on. This is high-risk because it introduces attack vectors that are outside the direct control of the application developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

This specific path within dependency exploitation is high-risk because known vulnerabilities in dependencies are often easily exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [FactoryBot or its Dependencies Contain Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/factorybot_or_its_dependencies_contain_known_vulnerabilities.md)

This specific node points to the danger of using versions of FactoryBot or its dependencies that have publicly known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering or Insider Threat](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_or_insider_threat.md)

This critical node represents the risk of malicious actors within the development team or those who have compromised developer accounts intentionally introducing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Factory Definitions Introduced by Insiders](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_factory_definitions_introduced_by_insiders.md)

This path represents the risk of a malicious insider or someone with a compromised developer account intentionally introducing flawed or malicious factory definitions. This is high-risk due to the potential for significant and targeted damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Developer Account or Malicious Insider](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_developer_account_or_malicious_insider.md)

This specific node highlights the severe risk posed by compromised accounts or malicious insiders who can directly manipulate factory definitions and potentially the application.

This specific path within insider threats is high-risk because it represents a scenario where an attacker has privileged access and can directly manipulate the application's testing infrastructure.
