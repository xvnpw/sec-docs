# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/factory_bot

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Factory Definitions](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_factory_definitions.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Factory Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to source code repositories or development environments and discover sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personally identifiable information) hardcoded within factory definitions. This could be achieved through compromised developer accounts, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in version control systems.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data could lead to unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or identity theft.
    *   **Affected FactoryBot Component:** Factory definition files (e.g., Ruby files defining factories).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict code review processes to identify and remove hardcoded sensitive data.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure vault solutions for managing sensitive test data within factories.
        *   Implement secrets scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect accidental commits of sensitive information in factory files.
        *   Restrict access to source code repositories and development environments based on the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Data Leakage from Test Database with Sensitive Factory Data](./threats/data_leakage_from_test_database_with_sensitive_factory_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage from Test Database with Sensitive Factory Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the test environment's security controls to gain unauthorized access to the test database. If factory definitions were used to populate the test database with realistic but sensitive data (even if intended for testing), this data could be exfiltrated. The *direct involvement* of FactoryBot is in creating and populating this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data residing in the test database, potentially leading to compliance violations, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected FactoryBot Component:** The `create`, `build`, and `create_list` methods (and similar methods that directly interact with the database to create records based on factory definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Anonymize or mask sensitive data within factory definitions used for populating the test database.
        *   Implement robust access controls and network segmentation for the test environment.
        *   Regularly audit the security of the test database and its access permissions.
        *   Avoid using production data directly in factory definitions for test environments.

## Threat: [Accidental Execution of Factory Code in Production](./threats/accidental_execution_of_factory_code_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Execution of Factory Code in Production
    *   **Description:**  Due to misconfiguration or errors in the build or deployment process, test code including factory definitions could be inadvertently executed in a production environment. This could lead to unintended data creation, modification, or deletion in the production database *directly through FactoryBot's actions*.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption or loss in the production environment, disruption of production services, and potential financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected FactoryBot Component:** All FactoryBot components, as the entire library could be loaded and potentially used to create or manipulate data in production.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and automated build and deployment pipelines that strictly separate test and production code and prevent the inclusion of test-related dependencies and code in production builds.
        *   Utilize environment variables or configuration settings to explicitly disable or prevent the initialization and execution of FactoryBot in production environments.
        *   Implement thorough testing of the deployment process to ensure only production-ready code is deployed.
        *   Enforce clear separation of duties and access controls for deployment processes.
