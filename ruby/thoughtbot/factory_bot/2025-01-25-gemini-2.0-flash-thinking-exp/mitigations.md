## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Test Data - Anonymization in Factories](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_test_data_-_anonymization_in_factories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify factory attributes that might contain or resemble sensitive data (e.g., email addresses, names, phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers, financial details).
    2.  For each identified attribute, replace hardcoded sensitive or realistic-looking sensitive data with anonymized or synthetic data generation methods within your factory definitions.
    3.  Utilize libraries like `Faker` or create custom helper functions within your test suite to generate realistic but non-sensitive data directly within factory definitions. For example, instead of `"john.doe@example.com"` in a factory, use `Faker::Internet.email`.
    4.  Ensure that generated data maintains the correct format and data type required by the application to ensure tests remain valid when using factories.
    5.  Regularly review factory definitions to identify and update any instances where sensitive data might have been inadvertently introduced or not properly anonymized in factory definitions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in test databases (High Severity) - If test databases populated by factories are compromised, real-looking PII created by factories could be exposed.
    *   Accidental use of test database backups in non-test environments (Medium Severity) - If backups of test databases containing realistic PII generated by factories are mistakenly used in staging or development, sensitive data could be exposed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of PII in test databases: High Reduction - Anonymization within factories significantly reduces the risk of exposing real PII generated by factories.
    *   Accidental use of test database backups in non-test environments: Medium Reduction - Reduces the severity of potential exposure from factory-generated data, but doesn't eliminate the risk if anonymization is not perfect or if other sensitive data exists outside of factory context.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented in development environment factories for email and name fields.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Anonymization needs to be extended to all factories and attributes that could potentially contain sensitive data, including addresses, phone numbers, and any custom sensitive fields defined in factories. Staging and CI environments should also use anonymized factories consistently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Values for Security-Sensitive Attributes in Factories](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_values_for_security-sensitive_attributes_in_factories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify factory attributes that are security-sensitive, such as passwords, API keys, access tokens, roles, or permissions, within your factory definitions.
    2.  For these attributes in factories, explicitly define secure and appropriate default values within the factory definitions instead of relying on potentially weak or predictable defaults.
    3.  When defining factories, for passwords, use a strong, randomly generated password. For API keys or tokens, generate random, unique strings within the factory definition. For roles or permissions, set defaults in factories to the least privileged necessary for testing the specific feature.
    4.  Avoid using common or easily guessable default values like `"password"`, `"123456"`, or `"admin"` in factory definitions.
    5.  Utilize factory callbacks (e.g., `after_build`, `after_create`) within factory definitions to programmatically generate these secure default values, potentially using secure random number generators or dedicated libraries called from within the factory.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Predictable default credentials in test environments (Medium Severity) - Weak default passwords or API keys defined in factories can be easily guessed or exploited if test environments are accessible.
    *   Accidental use of insecure defaults in development or staging environments (Low Severity) - While less likely, developers might copy factory defaults to other environments, potentially introducing weak security based on factory examples.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Predictable default credentials in test environments: High Reduction - Using strong, randomly generated defaults within factories significantly reduces the risk of exploitation.
    *   Accidental use of insecure defaults in development or staging environments: Low Reduction - Primarily addresses the risk in test environments using factories, with a minor indirect benefit to other environments by promoting secure practices exemplified in factories.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, default passwords in user factories are currently set to a static, weak value for ease of testing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to update user factories and any other factories dealing with authentication or authorization to use secure, randomly generated default values for passwords, API keys, and similar attributes. This secure default generation in factories should be implemented across all environments (development, staging, CI).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews Specifically for Factory Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_specifically_for_factory_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Incorporate factory definition files `(factories/*.rb)` into the standard code review process, with a specific focus on security aspects of factory usage.
    2.  Ensure that all changes to factory definitions, including additions, modifications, and deletions, are reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the codebase, specifically looking at factory-related security concerns.
    3.  During code reviews of factory definitions, specifically focus on:
        *   Potential exposure of sensitive data in factory attributes.
        *   Use of secure or insecure default values for security-sensitive attributes within factories.
        *   Unintentional or malicious modifications to factory logic that could introduce security issues via test data or factory behavior.
        *   Overall clarity and maintainability of factory definitions to ensure long-term security and reduce chances of errors in factory usage.
    4.  Use code review checklists or guidelines that specifically include security considerations for factory definitions to ensure reviewers are aware of factory-specific security risks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Introduction of sensitive data into factories by developers (Medium Severity) - Developers might unintentionally or unknowingly add real or realistic sensitive data to factories, which code review can catch.
    *   Introduction of insecure default values by developers in factories (Low Severity) - Developers might introduce weak default values in factories without realizing the security implications, which code review can identify.
    *   Malicious modification of factories by internal threats (Medium Severity) - In case of internal malicious actors, factory definitions could be tampered with to introduce vulnerabilities or expose data through test setup, which code review can help detect.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of sensitive data into factories by developers: Medium Reduction - Code reviews specifically focused on factories can catch unintentional introduction of sensitive data in factory definitions.
    *   Introduction of insecure default values by developers in factories: Medium Reduction - Code reviews focused on factories can identify and correct insecure default values defined in factories.
    *   Malicious modification of factories by internal threats: Medium Reduction - Code reviews of factory definitions act as a deterrent and detection mechanism for malicious changes to factory setup.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, code reviews are generally implemented for all code changes, including factory definitions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  While code reviews are in place, there isn't a specific checklist or guideline that explicitly focuses on security aspects of factory definitions. Need to enhance the code review process with specific security checks for factories to ensure factory-related security is consistently reviewed.
