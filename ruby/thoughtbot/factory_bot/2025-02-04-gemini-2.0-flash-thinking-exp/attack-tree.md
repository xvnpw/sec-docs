## Attack Tree Path: [Root Goal: Compromise Application Using FactoryBot [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_goal_compromise_application_using_factorybot__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success in any of the branches below leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1: Accidental Production Exposure of FactoryBot Functionality [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_accidental_production_exposure_of_factorybot_functionality__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This path represents the risk of FactoryBot's development-focused functionality inadvertently becoming active or accessible in the production environment.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Production environments should be hardened and not include development tools. Exposure of FactoryBot can lead to various attacks, including DoS and data manipulation.

    *   **2.1. AND 1.1: FactoryBot Code/Libraries Included in Production Build [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  FactoryBot libraries and related code are mistakenly included in the production build, making the functionality available even if not intentionally exposed via routes.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Presence of development code in production increases the attack surface.

        *   **2.1.1. OR 1.1.1: Incomplete Build Process/Configuration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Flaws in the build process or configuration management lead to development dependencies being packaged into the production application.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  A common oversight that can easily happen if build processes are not rigorously defined and automated.

            *   **2.1.1.1. 1.1.1.1: Development Dependencies Not Stripped in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, the build process fails to remove development-specific libraries (like FactoryBot) when creating the production artifact.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly results in FactoryBot code being present in production.

        *   **2.1.2. OR 1.1.3: Accidental Deployment of Development Environment [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  The entire development environment configuration, including dependencies and potentially exposed routes, is mistakenly deployed to production.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  A severe misconfiguration leading to a highly vulnerable production setup.

            *   **2.1.2.1. 1.1.3.1: Wrong Environment Configuration Deployed [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Human error or pipeline misconfiguration causes the deployment of development environment settings instead of production settings.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Simple mistake with catastrophic consequences.

    *   **2.2. OR 1.2: Direct Access to FactoryBot Execution Endpoints (If Exposed) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Development or testing routes that utilize FactoryBot logic are unintentionally left exposed and accessible in the production application.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly allows attackers to trigger FactoryBot functionality in production.

        *   **2.2.1. OR 1.2.1: Unintentional Exposure of Development/Testing Routes [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Developers forget to remove or properly secure routes used for testing purposes that interact with FactoryBot.
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Common oversight, especially in fast-paced development.

            *   **2.2.1.1. 1.2.1.1: Routes Using FactoryBot Logic Not Properly Protected/Removed in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Specific routes that execute FactoryBot code (e.g., for creating test data) are not removed or secured with authentication/authorization in production.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly exploitable if routes are discoverable or guessable.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 2: Exploitation of Factory Definitions for Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/or_2_exploitation_of_factory_definitions_for_information_disclosure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Even if FactoryBot code is not executed in production, access to the application's codebase (containing factory definitions) can reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Why Critical Node:** Information disclosure can aid further attacks, although less directly impactful than production execution.

    *   **3.1. OR 2.1: Sensitive Data in Factory Definitions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Factory definitions themselves contain sensitive information, making them a target for information extraction if code access is gained.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Direct exposure of secrets or sensitive schema information.

        *   **3.1.1. OR 2.1.1: Hardcoded Secrets/Credentials in Factories (Anti-Pattern) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly hardcode secrets directly within factory definitions.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Direct secret compromise if codebase is accessed.

            *   **3.1.1.1. 2.1.1.1: Extract Secrets from Factory Code via Code Review/Source Code Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker gains access to the source code repository or leaked code files and extracts hardcoded secrets from factory files.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Direct and immediate secret compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 3: Denial of Service (DoS) via FactoryBot Abuse (If Exposed) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_3_denial_of_service__dos__via_factorybot_abuse__if_exposed___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If FactoryBot functionality is exposed in production, attackers can abuse it to create a Denial of Service by generating excessive database records.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Can lead to application unavailability and service disruption.

    *   **4.1. 3.1: Mass Data Creation in Production (If FactoryBot Executable) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit exposed FactoryBot functionality in production to create a massive number of database records.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly leads to database overload and potential application crash.

        *   **4.1.1. 3.1.1: Triggering FactoryBot to Create Excessive Records [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers find a way to trigger FactoryBot execution in production, specifically with the intent to create a large volume of data.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  The core action leading to the DoS.

            *   **4.1.1.1. 3.1.1.1: Exploiting Exposed FactoryBot Endpoints or Code to Generate Large Datasets [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage exposed routes or code paths to call FactoryBot and generate a large dataset, overwhelming the database.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  The specific method of triggering the DoS attack.
