# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/factory_bot

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Test Databases](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_test_databases.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with unauthorized access to test environments, could exploit sensitive data accidentally created in test databases by `factory_bot`. Factories might generate realistic but sensitive data (PII, secrets) and weak test database security allows exfiltration. The attacker could use this data for identity theft, espionage, or further attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, reputational damage, legal repercussions, compromise of internal systems if secrets are exposed.
*   **Affected Factory_Bot Component:** Factory definitions, data generation logic within factories, database interaction through factories.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Sanitization in Factories:** Use Faker or similar libraries to generate realistic but non-sensitive data. Avoid hardcoding or copying production data.
    *   **Secure Test Databases:** Implement strong access controls and encryption for test databases. Treat them as sensitive environments.
    *   **Regular Factory Audits:** Review factory definitions to sanitize inadvertently created sensitive data.
    *   **Environment Isolation:** Strictly separate test, staging, and production environments with access controls.

## Threat: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass Masking Real Vulnerabilities](./threats/authenticationauthorization_bypass_masking_real_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Overly permissive factories for testing authentication/authorization can bypass production security checks. Tests might pass (false positive) despite real vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these undetected vulnerabilities in production.
*   **Impact:** Undetected security vulnerabilities in production, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.
*   **Affected Factory_Bot Component:** Factory definitions related to user creation, role assignment, and permission setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Realistic User Factories:** Design factories to create users with roles and permissions accurately reflecting production roles. Avoid overly privileged "admin" factories unless necessary.
    *   **Explicit Authorization Tests:** Write tests explicitly verifying authorization logic for various user roles created by factories.
    *   **Code Review of Factories:** Review factory definitions to ensure accurate representation of user roles and no inadvertent security bypasses.
    *   **Security Testing:** Supplement tests with penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify missed vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Factory_Bot or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_factory_bot_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in `factory_bot` or its dependencies. Using vulnerable versions can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other exploits.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, system instability, potential for remote code execution.
*   **Affected Factory_Bot Component:** `factory_bot` library itself, its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep `factory_bot` and dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Use automated dependency scanning in CI/CD to detect vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:** Include `factory_bot` and dependencies in regular security audits.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories for vulnerability information.

## Threat: [Accidental Data Modification/Deletion in Non-Test Environments](./threats/accidental_data_modificationdeletion_in_non-test_environments.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured `factory_bot` in test environments might connect to and modify data in non-test environments (staging, production) due to incorrect database connection settings. An attacker manipulating test environment configuration could trigger this for data corruption or loss in production.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, application downtime, business disruption, potential financial losses.
*   **Affected Factory_Bot Component:** Database connection configuration used by `factory_bot` in test environments, test environment setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Enforce environment-specific database connection configurations using variables or separate files.
    *   **Database Isolation:** Isolate test databases from non-test databases using dedicated instances or schemas.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement automated checks to validate database connection configurations in test environments.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Access):** Grant minimal database privileges to test users and processes.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure (for test environments):** Use immutable infrastructure for consistent and correct test environment configurations.
