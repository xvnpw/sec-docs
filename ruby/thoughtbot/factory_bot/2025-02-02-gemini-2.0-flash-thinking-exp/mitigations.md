## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Sensitive Data in Factories](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_sensitive_data_in_factories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Fields:** Review your application's data model and identify fields that store sensitive information (PII, secrets, financial data, etc.).
    2.  **Replace Real Data with Faker:** In your factory definitions, for each sensitive data field, replace any hardcoded real or realistic data with calls to the Faker gem (e.g., `Faker::Name.name`, `Faker::Internet.email`, `Faker::Lorem.word`).
    3.  **Placeholder Secrets:** For fields representing secrets (API keys, passwords), use placeholder values like `"placeholder_api_key"` or generate random strings using `SecureRandom.hex(32)` instead of actual secrets.
    4.  **Review and Update:** Regularly review factory definitions to ensure no new sensitive data is inadvertently introduced and update Faker usage as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Test Environments (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of real or realistic sensitive data in test databases, logs, or during debugging.
    *   **Data Breach via Test Database Backup (Medium Severity):** If test databases are backed up and these backups are compromised, sensitive data within factories could be exposed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Test Environments (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by replacing real data with non-sensitive, generated data.
    *   **Data Breach via Test Database Backup (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the severity of a potential breach by limiting the exposure to non-sensitive data in test backups.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `spec/factories`. Faker is used for names and emails in `User` and `Customer` factories. Passwords are currently set to `"password"` in `User` factory.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Placeholder secrets are not consistently used for API keys or other secret-like fields across all factories.
    *   Review and update process for factory definitions is not formally established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Defaulting to Sensitive Data in Factories](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_defaulting_to_sensitive_data_in_factories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Factory Defaults:** Examine factory definitions, especially for attributes related to roles, permissions, or access levels.
    2.  **Set Minimum Necessary Privileges:** Ensure factories create entities with the minimum necessary privileges or roles required for the tests they support. Avoid creating default `"admin"` users unless specifically needed for admin-related tests.
    3.  **Use Traits for Elevated Privileges:** If tests require entities with higher privileges, use Factory Bot traits to define these specific scenarios instead of making them the default.
    4.  **Test with Different Privilege Levels:** Design tests to explicitly cover scenarios with different privilege levels to ensure proper authorization and access control.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Privilege Escalation in Tests (Low Severity):** Tests might inadvertently rely on overly permissive default users, potentially masking authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration in Test Data (Low Severity):** Test data might not accurately reflect real-world security configurations if defaults are too permissive.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Privilege Escalation in Tests (Low Reduction):** Reduces the risk of overlooking authorization issues by ensuring tests are not implicitly relying on overly privileged users.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration in Test Data (Low Reduction):** Improves the accuracy of test data representation of security configurations.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default users created by factories generally have standard user roles. Admin users are created using traits when needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit review of all factory defaults for privilege levels is needed to ensure consistency.
    *   More comprehensive testing with different privilege levels could be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Set Secure Values for Security-Sensitive Attributes](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_set_secure_values_for_security-sensitive_attributes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Security-Sensitive Attributes:** Identify attributes in your data model that are critical for security (passwords, API keys, tokens, security flags, etc.).
    2.  **Explicitly Set in Factories:** In factory definitions for entities with these attributes, explicitly set them to secure or appropriate values. Do not rely on application defaults.
    3.  **Use Secure Generation Methods:** For passwords and similar attributes, use secure generation methods like `SecureRandom.hex(32)` or password hashing functions within the factory if needed for specific test scenarios.
    4.  **Avoid Hardcoded Insecure Defaults:** Do not use simple or predictable hardcoded values for security-sensitive attributes in factories.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Defaults in Test Data (Medium Severity):** Factories might create entities with insecure default values for security-sensitive attributes, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if these defaults are accidentally used or reflected in production.
    *   **Weak Password Usage in Tests (Low Severity):** Using weak or predictable passwords in test data could make tests less realistic and potentially mask password-related vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Defaults in Test Data (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by ensuring security-sensitive attributes are explicitly set to secure values in test data.
    *   **Weak Password Usage in Tests (Low Reduction):** Improves the security posture of test data by using stronger password generation methods.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Passwords in `User` factory are currently set to `"password"`. API keys and tokens are often generated using `SecureRandom.hex` in factories where they are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of secure password generation across all factories where passwords are relevant.
    *   Review and standardization of how security-sensitive attributes are handled in all factories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Strong Password Generation in Factories](./mitigation_strategies/use_strong_password_generation_in_factories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Replace Weak Passwords:** In factories where passwords are set (e.g., `User` factory), replace any weak or hardcoded passwords (like `"password"`) with strong password generation using `SecureRandom.hex(32)` or similar methods.
    2.  **Consider Password Hashing (If Needed):** If your tests require interacting with password hashing logic, you might need to hash the generated password within the factory using your application's password hashing mechanism (e.g., `BCrypt::Password.create(generated_password)`).
    3.  **Ensure Password Complexity (If Applicable):** If your application enforces password complexity rules, ensure the generated passwords in factories meet these requirements for relevant test cases.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weak Password Usage in Tests (Low Severity):** Using weak passwords in test data could make tests less realistic and potentially mask password-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Password Guessing in Test Environments (Very Low Severity):** While unlikely, weak passwords in test environments could theoretically be more easily guessed in case of unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weak Password Usage in Tests (Low Reduction):** Improves the realism and security posture of test data by using strong passwords.
    *   **Password Guessing in Test Environments (Very Low Reduction):** Marginally reduces the already low risk of password guessing in test environments.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some factories use `SecureRandom.hex` for token generation, but passwords in `User` factory are still `"password"`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Update `User` factory and other relevant factories to use `SecureRandom.hex(32)` for password generation.
    *   Consider password hashing in factories if needed for specific password-related tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Design Factories to Be Focused and Minimal](./mitigation_strategies/design_factories_to_be_focused_and_minimal.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Factory Complexity:** Examine existing factory definitions for complexity and nesting levels.
    2.  **Simplify Factories:** Refactor overly complex factories to be more focused and minimal. Break down large factories into smaller, more specific factories or use traits to handle variations.
    3.  **Minimize Associations:** Reduce unnecessary associations in factories. Only include associations that are directly required for the tests using those factories.
    4.  **Optimize Callbacks and Sequences:** Review factory callbacks and sequences for performance impact. Simplify or remove unnecessary or resource-intensive operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Performance Issues in Tests (Medium Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Complex factories can lead to slow test execution and increased database load, potentially hindering security testing efforts.
    *   **Test Maintainability Issues (Low Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Overly complex factories can make tests harder to understand and maintain, indirectly impacting the ability to effectively test security features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Performance Issues in Tests (Medium Reduction):** Improves test performance and reduces database load by simplifying factory creation.
    *   **Test Maintainability Issues (Low Reduction):** Enhances test maintainability and readability, indirectly improving the effectiveness of security testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some factories are relatively focused, but others could be simplified.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and refactoring of complex factories to improve focus and minimize data generation.
    *   Establish guidelines for factory design to promote simplicity and minimize complexity in future factory creation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Factory Usage Scope within Tests](./mitigation_strategies/limit_factory_usage_scope_within_tests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Test Setup:** Examine test files and identify areas where factories are used.
    2.  **Create Only Necessary Factories:** Within each test case, create only the specific factory instances that are directly required for that test. Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
    3.  **Avoid Global Factory Setup:** Minimize or eliminate global factory setup (e.g., in `before(:all)` blocks) that creates objects used across multiple tests. Prefer creating factories within `before(:each)` or directly within individual `it` blocks.
    4.  **Refactor Tests for Specificity:** Refactor tests to be more focused and specific, reducing the need for large numbers of factory objects.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Performance Issues in Tests (Medium Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Excessive factory usage can contribute to slow test execution and increased database load.
    *   **Test Readability and Maintainability Issues (Low Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Unnecessary factory objects can make tests harder to understand and maintain.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Performance Issues in Tests (Medium Reduction):** Improves test performance and reduces database load by limiting unnecessary factory creation.
    *   **Test Readability and Maintainability Issues (Low Reduction):** Enhances test readability and maintainability by focusing factory usage on specific test needs.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Tests generally create factories within `before(:each)` or `it` blocks. Global factory setup is minimal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Further review of tests to identify and eliminate any instances of unnecessary factory creation.
    *   Promote best practices for limiting factory scope during code reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Factory Creation Strategies for Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_factory_creation_strategies_for_performance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Factory Performance:** Profile factory creation performance to identify bottlenecks (e.g., slow callbacks, inefficient sequences, excessive database queries).
    2.  **Optimize Callbacks and Sequences:** Refactor or remove slow or unnecessary callbacks and sequences. Ensure sequences are efficient and avoid redundant operations.
    3.  **Optimize Associations:** Review factory associations for efficiency. Consider using `association :related_object, factory: :minimal_related_object_factory` to use lighter factories for associations when full object creation is not needed.
    4.  **Batch Create Records (Where Possible):** If factories create multiple records of the same type, explore batch creation techniques to reduce database round trips.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) in Test Environments (Medium Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Inefficient factory creation can lead to slow test suites and potentially contribute to resource exhaustion in test environments under heavy load.
    *   **Slow Security Testing Cycles (Low Severity - Indirect Security Risk):** Slow test suites due to factory performance issues can hinder the speed and efficiency of security testing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) in Test Environments (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of performance-related issues in test environments by optimizing factory creation.
    *   **Slow Security Testing Cycles (Low Reduction):** Improves the speed and efficiency of security testing by reducing test suite execution time.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not systematically implemented. Factory performance optimization is done reactively when performance issues are noticed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Proactive factory performance analysis and optimization is not a standard practice.
    *   No established guidelines for writing performant factories.
