## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents the initial stage where an attacker attempts to introduce malicious content into the application through Paperclip's file upload functionality.
    *   Success at this node is critical as it enables subsequent attacks involving malicious file uploads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass File Type Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_file_type_restrictions.md)

*   This path focuses on techniques attackers use to circumvent client-side or basic server-side checks that aim to restrict the types of files uploaded.
    *   **Spoof File Extension:**
        *   Attackers rename a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) with an extension that is typically allowed by the application (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
        *   If the application relies solely on the file extension for validation, it might incorrectly identify the file as safe.
    *   **Manipulate MIME Type:**
        *   Attackers craft a malicious HTTP request where the `Content-Type` header does not match the actual file content.
        *   For example, a PHP web shell might be sent with a `Content-Type: image/jpeg` header.
        *   If the application primarily relies on the `Content-Type` header for validation, this can bypass the check.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files (AND Bypass File Type Restrictions)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files__and_bypass_file_type_restrictions_.md)

*   This path describes the action of uploading files with malicious intent, which is only possible after successfully bypassing file type restrictions.
    *   **Upload Web Shell (e.g., PHP, JSP):**
        *   A web shell is a script (often written in PHP, JSP, or other server-side languages) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server remotely.
        *   If an attacker can upload a web shell and then access it through a web browser, they gain full control over the server.
        *   This is a high-impact attack vector, often leading to data breaches, server compromise, and further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node focuses on vulnerabilities that arise during the processing of uploaded files by Paperclip or its associated libraries (like ImageMagick).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Library Vulnerabilities (e.g., ImageMagick)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_library_vulnerabilities__e_g___imagemagick_.md)

*   Paperclip often uses external libraries like ImageMagick for tasks such as resizing, converting, and manipulating images. These libraries have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Shell Injection via Filename:**
        *   If the application passes user-provided filenames directly to the command line of ImageMagick (or similar tools) without proper sanitization, attackers can inject shell commands within the filename.
        *   For example, an attacker might upload a file named `image.jpg; rm -rf /`. When Paperclip processes this file, the `rm -rf /` command could be executed on the server, potentially deleting critical system files.
        *   This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to immediate and severe compromise of the server.
