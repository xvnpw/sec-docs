# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/paperclip

## Threat: [Malicious Executable Upload via Mismatched Extension](./threats/malicious_executable_upload_via_mismatched_extension.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a file that is actually an executable but renames it with an allowed extension. Paperclip stores the file with this potentially misleading extension. If the application then serves this file directly based on the stored extension, it can lead to remote code execution. Paperclip's role is in persisting the file with the attacker-controlled extension.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** `Paperclip::Storage` (stores the file with the extension).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Content Type Validation:** Validate file content, not just the extension, *before* Paperclip stores the file.
* **Serving Files from a Separate Domain/Subdomain:** Configure the web server to serve uploaded files from a domain that does not execute scripts. This mitigates the impact even if Paperclip stores the file with a misleading extension.
* **`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` Header:** Set this header to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image Processing](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_image_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted image that, when processed by Paperclip's image processors (like ImageMagick), triggers a request to an attacker-controlled URL. Paperclip initiates this processing through its integration with these libraries.

**Impact:** **High**. Exposure of internal services, potential data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `Paperclip::Processors::Thumbnail` (or other processors), interaction with underlying image processing libraries.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Update Image Processing Libraries:** Keep ImageMagick and other dependencies updated.
* **Disable Vulnerable ImageMagick Features:** Configure ImageMagick's policy to disable vulnerable coders.
* **Sandboxing Image Processing:** Run image processing in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Uploads](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_svg_uploads.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads an SVG file containing malicious JavaScript. Paperclip stores this file. If the application then serves this SVG directly without sanitization, the script can execute in the user's browser. Paperclip's role is in storing the potentially malicious SVG.

**Impact:** **High**. User account compromise, data theft.

**Affected Component:** `Paperclip::Storage` (stores the SVG file).

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **SVG Sanitization:** Sanitize uploaded SVG files *after* Paperclip stores them but before serving.
* **`Content-Type` Header:** Ensure the correct `Content-Type` header is set when serving SVGs.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP.
