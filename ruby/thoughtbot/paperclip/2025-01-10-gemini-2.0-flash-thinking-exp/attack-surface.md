# Attack Surface Analysis for thoughtbot/paperclip

## Attack Surface: [Filename Manipulation & Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/filename_manipulation_&_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious users can craft filenames with special characters (like "..") to attempt writing files outside the intended storage directory.
    *   **How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip, by default, uses the uploaded filename for storage. Without proper sanitization, it can pass these malicious filenames to the underlying storage mechanism.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a file named `../../../evil.sh`. If not sanitized, Paperclip might attempt to store this file in a location outside the intended upload directory.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, storing files in unintended locations leading to unauthorized access or code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize filenames on the server-side before passing them to Paperclip. Remove or replace potentially dangerous characters.
        *   Use Paperclip's `hash_secret` option to generate unique, unpredictable filenames, effectively ignoring user-provided names for storage.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Type Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_type_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Allowing users to upload any file type can lead to the execution of malicious code if the storage location is web-accessible.
    *   **How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip facilitates the storage of uploaded files. Without explicit configuration, it doesn't inherently restrict file types.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a `.php` file containing malicious code. If stored in a web-accessible directory and the server is configured to execute PHP, the attacker can trigger the execution of this code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed file extensions in Paperclip's configuration using the `content_type` validation.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (like ImageMagick, often used by Paperclip processors) can be exploited by uploading maliciously crafted image files.
    *   **How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip often utilizes external processors for image manipulation. If these processors have vulnerabilities, Paperclip acts as the entry point by handling the potentially malicious file.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a known vulnerability in ImageMagick, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep ImageMagick and other processors updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Consider using secure processing options or disabling vulnerable features within processor configurations if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect file system permissions on the storage directory can allow unauthorized users to access or modify uploaded files.
    *   **How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip writes files to the specified storage location. If the permissions on this location are too permissive, it introduces a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** The uploads directory has world-writable permissions. An attacker could upload malicious files or modify existing ones.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the storage directory has restrictive permissions, allowing only the application user to read and write files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Interpolations in Storage Paths/URLs](./attack_surfaces/insecure_interpolations_in_storage_pathsurls.md)

*   **Description:** If user-controlled input is used within Paperclip's interpolation options for storage paths or URLs, it could lead to path traversal or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip allows customization of storage paths and URLs using interpolations. If not carefully handled, this can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A configuration uses `/:class/:attachment/:id/:style/:fingerprint`. If `:class` is directly taken from user input without sanitization, an attacker could manipulate it to access different directories.
    *   **Impact:** Path traversal, potential access to sensitive data or unintended file storage locations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in Paperclip interpolations.
        *   If user input is necessary, sanitize and validate it rigorously before using it in interpolations.
