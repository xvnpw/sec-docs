# Threat Model Analysis for thoughtbot/paperclip

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker uploads a file containing malicious code disguised as a legitimate file type.
        *   **How:** If Paperclip's configuration allows storing files in a location where the web server can execute them, or if Paperclip triggers vulnerable image processing, the uploaded file can lead to code execution.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Paperclip Component:**
        *   **Description:** `Paperclip::Storage::Filesystem` (if insecure storage location is configured), `Paperclip::Processors` (if vulnerable image processing is triggered by Paperclip), `Paperclip::Attachment` (handling the upload process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Paperclip to store uploaded files in a location outside the web server's document root.
        *   Ensure the web server is configured to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions within Paperclip's validation options.
        *   Keep image processing libraries used by Paperclip up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using sandboxed environments for image processing configured through Paperclip.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Files](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_uploaded_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Files
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker uploads a file (e.g., an SVG image, an HTML file) containing malicious JavaScript code.
        *   **How:** If Paperclip is configured to serve these files directly without setting appropriate `Content-Type` headers, the browser might execute the malicious script when the file is accessed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Compromise of user accounts, data theft, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Paperclip Component:**
        *   **Description:** `Paperclip::Attachment` (handling the upload), potentially `Paperclip::Storage::Filesystem` or other storage adapters if they are used to directly serve the file without proper headers configured outside of Paperclip.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the web server (not directly Paperclip) to serve uploaded files with the correct `Content-Type` header (e.g., `application/octet-stream` for downloads) and the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header.
        *   While Paperclip doesn't directly handle content sanitization, integrate sanitization libraries into the application's workflow after Paperclip handles the upload.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image Processing](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_image_processing.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image Processing
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that, when processed by an image processing library configured through Paperclip (like ImageMagick), forces the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
        *   **How:** Vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, triggered by Paperclip's processing functionality, can be exploited to make arbitrary HTTP requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Access to internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible, potential data leakage, or the ability to perform actions on behalf of the server.
    *   **Affected Paperclip Component:**
        *   **Description:** `Paperclip::Processors` (specifically the image processing processor being used, e.g., `Paperclip::Processors::Thumbnail`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep image processing libraries used by Paperclip up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Disable or restrict vulnerable features of image processing libraries (e.g., coders in ImageMagick) if configurable through the processing options in Paperclip.
        *   Consider running image processing in a sandboxed environment if the chosen processing library and Paperclip's integration allow for it.

## Threat: [Insecure File Storage Permissions Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_file_storage_permissions_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Storage Permissions Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to uploaded files due to overly permissive file system permissions on the storage location configured in Paperclip or misconfigured cloud storage buckets used by Paperclip.
        *   **How:** If the storage location managed by Paperclip is not properly secured, anyone with knowledge of the file paths or access to the storage can read, modify, or delete the files.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Data breach, data manipulation, or deletion of user-uploaded content.
    *   **Affected Paperclip Component:**
        *   **Description:** `Paperclip::Storage::Filesystem` or other storage adapters (e.g., `Paperclip::Storage::S3`) as configured within Paperclip.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the storage location configured in Paperclip has appropriate access controls (e.g., restrictive file system permissions, private S3 buckets with proper IAM policies).
        *   Regularly review and audit storage permissions configured for Paperclip.
