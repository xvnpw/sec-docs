## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server__critical_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success at this node signifies a complete compromise of the server hosting the application. This can be achieved through various vulnerabilities within Paperclip's handling of file uploads and processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This involves leveraging weaknesses in image processing libraries, most commonly ImageMagick, which Paperclip often utilizes.

**Mechanism:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file designed to exploit a known vulnerability within the image processing library. When Paperclip triggers the processing of this image (e.g., for thumbnail generation), the malicious code embedded within the image is executed by the vulnerable library.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known ImageMagick Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_imagemagick_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This specifically targets publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) within the ImageMagick library.

**Mechanism:** Attackers leverage well-documented exploits for ImageMagick. This often involves crafting image files with specific header manipulations or embedded commands that trigger the vulnerability during processing. A common example is exploiting shell injection vulnerabilities where the filename or other parameters passed to ImageMagick are not properly sanitized, allowing the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filename Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filename_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This focuses on weaknesses in how Paperclip and the application handle user-provided filenames.

**Mechanism:** Attackers upload files with malicious filenames designed to exploit how these filenames are used in server-side operations. This can involve path traversal attempts or command injection.

**Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability, this can lead to overwriting sensitive files, reading arbitrary files, or even executing arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Filename (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_filename__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of proper filename sanitization to access or manipulate files outside the intended storage directory.

**Mechanism:** An attacker crafts a filename containing path traversal sequences like `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the filename before using it to store or access the file, the attacker can potentially access or overwrite files in other directories.

**Impact:** Successful path traversal can allow attackers to read sensitive configuration files, overwrite critical system files, or even gain unauthorized access to other parts of the file system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Filename (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_filename__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into the filename that are then executed by the server.

**Mechanism:** If the application or Paperclip uses the uploaded filename in a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can embed shell commands within the filename (e.g., `; rm -rf /`). When this command is executed by the server, it can have devastating consequences.

**Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the web application, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
