# Attack Surface Analysis for thoughtbot/paperclip

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload Types](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_types.md)

**Description:** The application allows uploading files of any type without proper validation.

**How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip handles the file upload process and storage. If the application doesn't implement strict `content_type` validation *before* Paperclip processes the file, malicious files can be stored.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as a `.jpg` file. If the web server allows execution of PHP files in the upload directory, this could lead to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict `content_type` validation using Paperclip's `content_type` validator or custom validation logic *before* saving the attachment.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Content-Type Validation](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_content-type_validation.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the `Content-Type` header during upload to bypass client-side or insufficient server-side validation.

**How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip relies on the `Content-Type` header provided by the client. If the application only checks this header without further verification, it can be tricked.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `Content-Type` header of a malicious executable to `image/jpeg` to bypass a simple `content_type` check.

**Impact:** Upload of malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution or other attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Combine `content_type` validation with other checks.
*   Sanitize filenames to prevent injection of potentially harmful characters.

## Attack Surface: [Filename Manipulation Leading to Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/filename_manipulation_leading_to_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to store files outside the intended upload directory.

**How Paperclip Contributes:** If the application doesn't sanitize filenames before Paperclip stores them, malicious filenames can be used to write files to arbitrary locations.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job`. If not sanitized, this could overwrite system files or create malicious cron jobs.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potential system compromise, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize filenames using methods like `File.basename` or regular expressions to remove or replace potentially dangerous characters and path traversal sequences *before* passing the filename to Paperclip.
*   Configure Paperclip to generate unique and safe filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (via ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick)](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities__via_imagemagickgraphicsmagick_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (like ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick) used by Paperclip for transformations.

**How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip often uses these libraries for image resizing, format conversion, etc. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, uploading specially crafted images can trigger them.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image that exploits a known vulnerability in ImageMagick, leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick (and any other processing dependencies) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Sanitize image processing options passed to Paperclip to prevent command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Large File Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__large_file_uploads_.md)

**Description:** Attackers upload extremely large files to exhaust server resources (disk space, memory, processing power).

**How Paperclip Contributes:** Paperclip handles the upload and storage of files. Without proper size limits, it can facilitate this attack.

**Example:** An attacker repeatedly uploads multi-gigabyte files, filling up the server's disk space and potentially crashing the application.

**Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, increased infrastructure costs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement file size limits using Paperclip's `size` validator.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) to Uploaded Files](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__to_uploaded_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers can guess or enumerate URLs to access files uploaded by other users without proper authorization.

**How Paperclip Contributes:** If Paperclip is configured to store files in predictable locations (e.g., based on user ID and filename), IDOR vulnerabilities can arise if the application doesn't implement proper access controls when serving these files.

**Example:** User A uploads a document. The URL is `example.com/uploads/users/123/document.pdf`. An attacker guesses or finds the URL `example.com/uploads/users/124/private_data.pdf` and gains access to User B's file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use non-predictable storage paths and filenames generated by Paperclip or custom logic.
