# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify file attachment management for Ruby on Rails applications.
  - Provide an easy-to-use interface for developers to handle file uploads, storage, and retrieval.
  - Reduce development time and complexity associated with file management in web applications.
- Business Risks:
  - Data loss due to improper file handling or storage.
  - Unauthorized access to uploaded files, potentially containing sensitive information.
  - Insecure file handling practices leading to vulnerabilities such as arbitrary file upload or server-side request forgery (SSRF).
  - Dependency on an open-source library, requiring ongoing maintenance and security updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Rails Framework Security - The project is built as a Ruby on Rails gem, leveraging the inherent security features provided by the Rails framework, such as protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, SQL Injection, etc.). Implemented within the Rails application using the gem.
  - security control: Server Security - The security of the server infrastructure where the Rails application and Paperclip are deployed. This includes operating system hardening, network security, and access controls. Implemented at the infrastructure level.
  - security control: Database Security - Security measures implemented for the database system used by the Rails application to store metadata related to file attachments. Implemented at the database level.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - As an open-source gem, Paperclip relies on other libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could introduce security risks. Risk is accepted by using open-source components and needs to be mitigated by dependency scanning and updates.
  - accepted risk: Configuration Errors - Misconfiguration of Paperclip or the underlying storage mechanisms (e.g., incorrect permissions on file storage) could lead to security vulnerabilities. Risk is accepted as part of operational responsibility and needs to be mitigated by proper documentation and secure configuration practices.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Input Validation - Implement robust input validation for file uploads, including file type, size, and content checks, to prevent malicious file uploads.
  - security control: Secure File Storage - Ensure files are stored securely, considering encryption at rest and appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
  - security control: Access Control - Implement proper authorization mechanisms to control who can upload, access, and manage files.
  - security control: Vulnerability Scanning - Regularly scan the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The Rails application using Paperclip must implement authentication to verify the identity of users uploading and accessing files.
    - Requirement: Paperclip itself should not handle authentication, but rely on the authentication mechanisms provided by the host Rails application.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The Rails application must implement authorization to control which users can upload files and access specific files.
    - Requirement: Paperclip should provide mechanisms to integrate with the application's authorization logic, allowing control over file access based on user roles or permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Paperclip must provide features to validate file uploads, including checking file types, sizes, and potentially file content (e.g., using content type detection).
    - Requirement: Validation should occur both on the client-side (for user feedback) and server-side (for security enforcement).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Consider encryption at rest for stored files, especially if they contain sensitive data. This might be implemented at the storage provider level (e.g., cloud storage encryption) or within the application.
    - Requirement: Ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) are used for file uploads and downloads to protect data in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - File Upload Functionality: Allowing users to upload files is critical for applications relying on user-generated content, document management, or data collection.
  - File Download/Access Functionality: Providing users with access to uploaded files is essential for content delivery, data sharing, and application functionality.
  - Management of File Metadata: Maintaining accurate metadata about files is important for organization, searchability, and data integrity.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - User Uploaded Files: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application. Files could contain highly sensitive personal data, confidential business documents, or publicly available information. The sensitivity level is determined by the application using Paperclip and the types of files users are allowed to upload.
  - File Metadata: Metadata itself might not be highly sensitive, but it can reveal information about file content and user activity. Sensitivity depends on the context and application requirements.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE Questions & Assumptions:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for Rails developers to handle file attachments.
  - Assumption: Security is a secondary but important consideration, especially for applications handling sensitive user data.
  - Question: What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) for applications using Paperclip? This will influence the required security controls.
  - Question: What is the acceptable level of risk for file data loss and unauthorized access? This will help prioritize security investments.

  - Question: Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that the project must adhere to?
- DESIGN Questions & Assumptions:
  - Assumption: Paperclip is designed to be storage agnostic and can be configured to use various storage backends (filesystem, cloud storage).
  - Assumption: The deployment environment will include standard components like web servers, application servers, and database servers.
  - Question: What are the expected performance and scalability requirements for file uploads and downloads? This might influence the choice of storage backend and deployment architecture.
  - Question: Are there any specific requirements for disaster recovery and business continuity related to file attachments?
