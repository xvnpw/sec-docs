# Attack Surface Analysis for thoughtbot/paperclip

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Type Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_type_upload.md)

**Description:** Paperclip configuration allows uploading files of any type without robust content-based validation, relying on easily spoofed file extensions.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Permissive default configurations and reliance on extension-based validation if `content_type` validation is not properly implemented.
**Example:** Uploading a malicious `.php` file disguised as `.jpg` which, if served directly, could lead to Remote Code Execution.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong server-side `content_type` validation using Paperclip's options and gems like `mimemagic`.
    *   Whitelist allowed MIME types in Paperclip configurations.
    *   Reject files with dangerous MIME types.
    *   Avoid serving user uploads directly from the application domain; use separate storage with restricted execution.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (File Storage)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities__file_storage_.md)

**Description:** Paperclip's storage path configuration, if not carefully managed, allows attackers to manipulate file paths to access or overwrite files outside the intended storage directory.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Using user-provided input directly in `path` configurations or insecurely customizing path interpolation within Paperclip settings.
**Example:** Crafting a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` during upload, potentially leading to overwriting or accessing sensitive system files if path sanitization is missing in Paperclip configuration.
**Impact:** Information disclosure, data integrity compromise, potential Remote Code Execution.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid user input in Paperclip `path` configurations.
    *   Sanitize any user input used in path construction before Paperclip processes it.
    *   Use Paperclip's built-in path interpolation securely and avoid complex, dynamic paths.
    *   Ensure storage paths are relative and prevent escaping the intended directory within Paperclip settings.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Uploads](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_uploads.md)

**Description:** Paperclip's URL upload feature, if enabled, allows attackers to make requests to internal or external resources by providing malicious URLs.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Directly enabling URL-based file fetching in Paperclip without proper validation and restriction of target URLs.
**Example:** Providing a URL to an internal service like `http://localhost:6379` (Redis) during a Paperclip URL upload, potentially exposing internal services or data.
**Impact:** Internal network scanning, access to internal services, data exfiltration, Denial of Service of external services.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable URL-based uploads in Paperclip if not strictly necessary.
    *   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization before Paperclip fetches files.
    *   Whitelist allowed domains or protocols for URL uploads within Paperclip configuration or application logic.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (via ImageMagick)](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities__via_imagemagick_.md)

**Description:** Paperclip's reliance on image processors like ImageMagick makes applications vulnerable to vulnerabilities within these processors when handling user-uploaded images.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Paperclip's integration with and usage of external image processors like ImageMagick for image transformations.
**Example:** Uploading a crafted image that exploits a known vulnerability in ImageMagick, leading to Remote Code Execution when Paperclip processes the image using ImageMagick.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), arbitrary file read.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep ImageMagick (or other image processors used by Paperclip) updated to the latest patched versions.
    *   Consider using sandboxed environments for image processing triggered by Paperclip.
    *   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in ImageMagick and specific image file formats processed by Paperclip.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Storage](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_storage.md)

**Description:** Paperclip is configured to store uploaded files in publicly accessible locations, exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Misconfiguration of Paperclip's `storage` and related settings, leading to files being stored in publicly accessible cloud buckets or web-accessible directories.
**Example:** Configuring Paperclip to use a public S3 bucket without proper access controls, making all uploaded files publicly accessible.
**Impact:** Information disclosure, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive files.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Paperclip storage locations are properly secured and not publicly accessible by default.
    *   For cloud storage, use private buckets and configure signed URLs for controlled access via Paperclip.
    *   For local storage, store files outside the web root and serve them through application logic with authorization checks, not directly via web server.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Errors Leading to High/Critical Risks](./attack_surfaces/configuration_errors_leading_to_highcritical_risks.md)

**Description:**  Incorrect or insecure Paperclip configurations directly lead to exploitable vulnerabilities with high or critical impact.
**Paperclip Contribution:**  Flexibility of Paperclip configuration allows for mistakes that can weaken security if best practices are not followed.
**Example:** Disabling essential validations like `content_type` for perceived performance gains, or using outdated and vulnerable versions of image processors due to neglecting updates in Paperclip setup.
**Impact:** Can lead to any of the High or Critical risks listed above (RCE, SSRF, Data Breach, etc.) depending on the specific misconfiguration.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand Paperclip's configuration options and security implications.
    *   Follow security best practices when configuring Paperclip, prioritizing strong validations and secure storage.
    *   Regularly audit Paperclip configurations for potential weaknesses and misconfigurations.
    *   Keep Paperclip and its dependencies updated to mitigate risks from outdated components.
