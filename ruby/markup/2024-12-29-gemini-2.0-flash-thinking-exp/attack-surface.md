Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving markup, with high and critical severity:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markup Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into markup content that, when processed and rendered by `github/markup`, executes in a user's browser.
    *   **How Markup Contributes:** `github/markup`'s core function is to convert various markup languages into HTML. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the *output* HTML, malicious scripts embedded within the input markup will be rendered and executed. Different markup languages offer various ways to embed HTML or script-like content.
    *   **Example:** A user submits Markdown containing: `` `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>` ``. When `github/markup` renders this, the `<script>` tag is included in the HTML output and executed by the browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Sanitization:**  Always sanitize the HTML output generated by `github/markup` before displaying it to users. Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., Loofah in Ruby) that removes or escapes potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Markup Features**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit features in certain markup languages supported by `github/markup` to make the server perform unintended requests to internal or external resources.
    *   **How Markup Contributes:** Some markup languages allow including external resources like images or iframes using specific syntax (e.g., Markdown image links, HTML `<img>` or `<iframe>` tags). If the application doesn't restrict the allowed protocols or target domains, attackers can manipulate these features.
    *   **Example:** A user submits Markdown containing: `` `![Internal Resource](http://internal.server/sensitive-data)` ``. If the application processes this without restrictions, the server might attempt to fetch the resource from the internal server.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict External Resource Loading:** Configure the underlying rendering engines (if possible) or implement application-level checks to restrict the loading of external resources. Whitelist allowed domains or protocols.
        *   **Disable Potentially Dangerous Features:** If certain markup features are not essential, consider disabling them in the rendering process.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application server from sensitive internal networks to limit the impact of SSRF.
