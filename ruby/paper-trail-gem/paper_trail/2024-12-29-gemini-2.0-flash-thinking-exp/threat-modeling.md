### High and Critical PaperTrail Threats

- **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Audit Logs
  - **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `versions` table, either through SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application's code that interacts with the table, direct database access due to compromised credentials, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in a data export feature that includes audit logs. They then read the contents of the `object` or `object_changes` columns, which contain serialized data representing the changes made to tracked models, potentially revealing sensitive information. This directly involves PaperTrail as it is responsible for storing this data in the `versions` table.
  - **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information, leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
  - **Affected PaperTrail Component:** `versions` table (data storage).
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - Secure database credentials and restrict direct database access to only necessary services and personnel.
    - Implement strong access controls on the `versions` table, limiting read access to authorized users only.
    - Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database, including within the `versions` table.
    - Carefully select which attributes are tracked by PaperTrail using the `:ignore` and `:only` options in model configurations.
    - Regularly review the data stored in the `versions` table and implement data retention policies to remove old or unnecessary sensitive data.

- **Threat:** Tampering with Audit Logs to Conceal Malicious Activity
  - **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., compromised administrator account or direct database access) modifies or deletes entries in the `versions` table to hide their malicious actions. This could involve altering the `whodunnit`, `object`, or `object_changes` columns to misrepresent events or removing records entirely to erase their tracks. This directly involves PaperTrail as the `versions` table is where its audit data is stored.
  - **Impact:** Loss of audit trail integrity, hindering incident response and forensic investigations, making it difficult to identify the source and scope of security breaches or unauthorized activities.
  - **Affected PaperTrail Component:** `versions` table (data storage).
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong access controls on the database and the `versions` table, restricting write and delete access to only highly trusted processes.
    - Consider using database features like audit trails or write-ahead logs that are separate from PaperTrail's data for an additional layer of immutable logging.
    - Regularly monitor the `versions` table for unexpected modifications or deletions.
    - Implement integrity checks or digital signatures on audit log entries to detect tampering.
    - Secure administrator accounts with strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and limit the number of users with administrative privileges.

- **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializers
  - **Description:** If custom serializers are used with PaperTrail to store complex data structures in the `object` or `object_changes` columns, an attacker who can influence the data being serialized (e.g., through a vulnerability in the application's data input) could inject malicious payloads that are then deserialized by PaperTrail, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security breaches. This threat directly arises from the use of PaperTrail's feature allowing custom serializers.
  - **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data corruption.
  - **Affected PaperTrail Component:** Custom serializers used with PaperTrail.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid using custom serializers if possible. Rely on PaperTrail's default serialization mechanisms.
    - If custom serializers are necessary, ensure they are implemented securely and are not vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    - Use safe deserialization libraries and keep them up to date.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious payloads.
