# Threat Model Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Threat: [Spoofing - whodunnit Spoofing via Direct Database Manipulation](./threats/spoofing_-_whodunnit_spoofing_via_direct_database_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** `whodunnit` Spoofing via Direct Database Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with direct write access to the `versions` table (e.g., through a compromised database account or a separate SQL injection vulnerability) directly modifies the `whodunnit` column to attribute changes to a different user.
    *   **Impact:** False attribution of actions, undermining audit trail integrity and potentially framing innocent users. Loss of accountability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `versions` table (`whodunnit` column), PaperTrail's core versioning mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Database Security:** Implement strict least-privilege access control on the database. Ensure database users have only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable database-level auditing to track all changes to the `versions` table, including the source of the changes (IP address, user, etc.).

## Threat: [Spoofing - whodunnit Spoofing via Application Code Manipulation](./threats/spoofing_-_whodunnit_spoofing_via_application_code_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** `whodunnit` Spoofing via Application Code Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker who can modify the application code (e.g., through a compromised server or a code injection vulnerability) alters the logic that sets the `whodunnit` value, causing it to record incorrect user information.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to direct database manipulation, this leads to false attribution of actions and undermines the audit trail.
    *   **Affected Component:** `PaperTrail::VersionConcern#user_for_paper_trail` (or the custom method used to set `whodunnit`), PaperTrail's configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Integrity:** Implement strong code integrity controls to prevent unauthorized code modifications (e.g., code signing, file integrity monitoring).
        *   **Externalize `whodunnit`:** Consider using an external, trusted service (e.g., an authentication provider) to determine the `whodunnit` value, making it harder to spoof.

## Threat: [Tampering - Direct Deletion of Version Records](./threats/tampering_-_direct_deletion_of_version_records.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Deletion of Version Records
    *   **Description:** An attacker with direct database access deletes records from the `versions` table, removing the history of specific changes.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of audit trail data, making it impossible to track past actions or revert to previous states. Potential for data loss if the application relies on version history for functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `versions` table, PaperTrail's core versioning mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Database Security:** Strict least-privilege access control on the database.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable database-level auditing.
        *   **Database Backups:** Implement regular, secure database backups and test the restoration process.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** If supported by the database, use RLS.

## Threat: [Tampering - Modification of Serialized object Data](./threats/tampering_-_modification_of_serialized_object_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Modification of Serialized `object` Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker with direct database access modifies the serialized data in the `object` column of the `versions` table, potentially injecting malicious code or altering historical data.
    *   **Impact:** If the application deserializes and uses this modified data without proper validation, it could lead to code execution, data corruption, or other security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `versions` table (`object` column), PaperTrail's serialization mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if deserialization is unsafe), High (if data is used without validation)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Safe Deserialization:** Use a safe deserialization library and whitelist allowed classes. *Never* use unsafe deserialization methods like `Marshal.load` with untrusted data.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data retrieved from the `object` column *before* using it.
        *   **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting the `object` data at rest.
        *   **Database Security:** Strict least-privilege access control on the database.

## Threat: [Tampering - Modification of object_changes](./threats/tampering_-_modification_of_object_changes.md)

*   **Threat:** Modification of `object_changes`
    * **Description:** Similar to modifying `object`, but targeting the `object_changes` column.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to incorrect display of changes, or potential vulnerabilities if the application uses this data unsafely.
    * **Affected Component:** `versions` table (`object_changes` column).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as for `object` modification.

## Threat: [Repudiation - Versioning Temporarily Disabled](./threats/repudiation_-_versioning_temporarily_disabled.md)

* **Threat:** Versioning Temporarily Disabled
    * **Description:** Versioning is accidentally or maliciously disabled (e.g., by commenting out code, changing configuration) for a period, resulting in a gap in the audit trail.
    * **Impact:** Loss of audit trail data for the period when versioning was disabled.
    * **Affected Component:** PaperTrail configuration, `PaperTrail.enabled = false`, model-level `has_paper_trail` declaration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Configuration Management:** Use a robust configuration management system.
        * **Code Review:** Require code reviews for any changes that could affect PaperTrail's configuration.
        * **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect if PaperTrail is disabled.
        * **Alerting:** Set up alerts to notify administrators if PaperTrail is disabled.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure - Unauthorized Access to Version History via UI/API](./threats/information_disclosure_-_unauthorized_access_to_version_history_via_uiapi.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Version History via UI/API
    *   **Description:** The application's user interface or API allows unauthorized users to view the version history of records, exposing potentially sensitive information.  This is *directly* related to PaperTrail because it's the version history that's being exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Application controllers and views that display version history, PaperTrail's `version` association.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement strict authorization checks.
        *   **API Security:** Carefully review API endpoints.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure - Sensitive Data Stored in object or object_changes](./threats/information_disclosure_-_sensitive_data_stored_in_object_or_object_changes.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Stored in `object` or `object_changes`
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII) is stored directly in the `object` or `object_changes` columns without encryption or redaction.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data if the `versions` table is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** `versions` table (`object` and `object_changes` columns), PaperTrail's serialization mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Avoid storing sensitive data in versioned fields.
        *   **Data Redaction/Anonymization:** Redact or anonymize sensitive data.
        *   **Field-Level Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive fields.
        *   **`ignore`, `only`, `skip` Options:** Use PaperTrail's options to exclude specific attributes.
