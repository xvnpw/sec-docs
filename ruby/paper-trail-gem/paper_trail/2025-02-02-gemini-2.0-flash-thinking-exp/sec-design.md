# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the `paper_trail` Ruby gem, a library designed to track changes to data within Ruby on Rails applications. It provides an audit trail of modifications made to models, enabling features like version history, rollback, and activity logging.

* Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Data Integrity: Ensuring that changes to application data are reliably recorded and can be reviewed.
  - Accountability: Providing a clear audit trail of who made what changes and when.
  - Compliance: Meeting regulatory or internal requirements for data change tracking and auditing.
  - Debugging and Troubleshooting: Assisting in identifying the root cause of issues by reviewing historical data changes.
  - Feature Enhancement: Enabling features like undo/redo, version comparison, and activity feeds based on tracked changes.

* Business Risks:
  - Data Loss or Corruption in Audit Logs: If the audit trail itself is compromised or unreliable, the benefits of using `paper_trail` are negated.
  - Performance Overhead: Tracking changes can introduce performance overhead to the application, potentially impacting user experience.
  - Storage Costs: Storing audit logs can consume significant storage space, especially in applications with high data modification rates.
  - Security Breaches via Audit Logs: If audit logs contain sensitive information and are not properly secured, they could become a target for attackers.
  - Compliance Failures: If `paper_trail` is not configured or used correctly, it may not meet the required compliance standards, leading to penalties or reputational damage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Management: Relies on RubyGems.org for gem distribution and dependency resolution. (Implemented by: RubyGems infrastructure)
  - security control: Code Review:  Project is open source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for community code review. (Implemented by: GitHub community and maintainers)
  - security control: Version Control: Uses Git for version control, providing history and traceability of code changes. (Implemented by: Git and GitHub)
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:  The gem depends on other Ruby gems, which may contain security vulnerabilities. Risk is mitigated by regular dependency updates and security scanning (if implemented by the consuming application).
  - accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of `paper_trail` in the consuming application could lead to incomplete or inaccurate audit logs, or potential security issues.
  - accepted risk: Data Exposure in Logs: Audit logs may inadvertently capture sensitive data if not configured carefully.

* Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement input validation and sanitization within `paper_trail` to prevent injection attacks when storing data in audit logs.
  - security control: Secure Configuration Guidance: Provide clear documentation and best practices for securely configuring `paper_trail`, including guidance on what data to track and how to protect audit logs.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the `paper_trail` gem code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, dependency scanning) into the development and release process of `paper_trail`.

* Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: `paper_trail` itself does not handle authentication. It relies on the authentication mechanisms of the consuming Rails application to determine the current user making changes.
  - Authorization: `paper_trail` should respect the authorization policies of the consuming Rails application. Access to audit logs should be restricted to authorized users only. The gem itself does not enforce authorization, this is responsibility of consuming application.
  - Input Validation: `paper_trail` must validate and sanitize data before storing it in the audit trail to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS if audit logs are displayed in a web interface). This is especially important for user-provided data that is being tracked.
  - Cryptography: Consider using encryption for sensitive data stored in audit logs, especially if the database itself is not encrypted at rest. This could involve encrypting specific attributes or the entire audit log data. Data masking or redaction techniques should also be considered to minimize the storage of sensitive data in audit logs.

# DESIGN

The `paper_trail` gem is designed as a library that integrates directly into Ruby on Rails applications. It leverages Rails' ActiveRecord models to intercept data changes and store them in audit logs.

## DEPLOYMENT

`paper_trail` is deployed as part of the Rails application deployment. There is no separate deployment process for the gem itself. The Rails application can be deployed in various environments, such as cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes), or traditional server infrastructure.

Let's consider a typical cloud deployment using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
  - Auditing Data Changes: The core business process is reliably tracking and auditing changes to application data. This is critical for compliance, accountability, and debugging.
  - Accessing Audit Logs:  Authorized personnel need to be able to access and review audit logs for various purposes (security investigations, compliance audits, etc.).

* Data Sensitivity:
  - Audit Logs: The sensitivity of data within audit logs depends on what is being tracked. It can range from low sensitivity (e.g., tracking status changes) to high sensitivity (e.g., tracking financial transactions, personal information, configuration changes).  If configured to track sensitive attributes, the audit logs themselves become highly sensitive.
  - Application Data being Tracked: The sensitivity of the original application data being tracked by `paper_trail` is also relevant, as changes to sensitive data will be recorded in the audit logs.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
  - What types of applications are intended to use `paper_trail`? Are they handling sensitive data (PII, financial data, etc.)?
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for applications using `paper_trail` (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
  - What is the expected volume of audit logs? What are the storage and performance considerations?
  - What are the typical use cases for accessing and reviewing audit logs? Who are the authorized users?
  - Are there any specific security requirements or concerns for audit logs in the target applications?

* Assumptions:
  - `paper_trail` is primarily used in web applications built with Ruby on Rails.
  - Security of audit logs is a concern, especially if sensitive data is tracked.
  - Consuming applications are responsible for implementing authorization and access control for audit logs.
  - Performance overhead of audit logging is acceptable for typical use cases.
  - Standard Ruby gem development and security practices are followed for `paper_trail` development.
