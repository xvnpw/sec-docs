# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Tracked Attributes](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_tracked_attributes.md)

**Description:**
1.  Within each model using `has_paper_trail`, review the declaration.
2.  Instead of relying on default behavior, use `only: [...]` to list attributes to be tracked or `ignore: [...]` to list attributes to be excluded from tracking.
3.  Carefully select attributes to track, ensuring sensitive data is not inadvertently included in version history.
4.  Update model files with explicit `only:` or `ignore:` options.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (High Severity) - Prevents accidental logging of sensitive attributes like passwords, API keys, or PII in the `versions` table.

**Impact:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (High Reduction) - Significantly reduces the risk of unintended sensitive data logging by controlling tracked attributes.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Codebase (Model files - e.g., `app/models/user.rb`, `app/models/product.rb`)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `skip_attributes_to_track`](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__skip_attributes_to_track_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify attributes that may dynamically contain sensitive information based on context.
2.  In a PaperTrail initializer (e.g., `config/initializers/paper_trail.rb`), configure `PaperTrail.config.skip_attributes_to_track = [...]`.
3.  Add these dynamic attributes to the `skip_attributes_to_track` array to prevent their tracking in version history.
4.  This provides a global configuration to skip tracking certain attribute names across all models.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (Medium Severity) - Prevents logging of attributes that are not always sensitive but can contain sensitive data in certain situations.

**Impact:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (Medium Reduction) - Adds a layer of protection for dynamically sensitive attributes, reducing potential exposure.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Configuration files (e.g., `config/initializers/paper_trail.rb`)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Version History](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_version_history.md)

**Description:**
1.  Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of the `versions` table.
2.  Use SQL queries or scripts to search for patterns of sensitive data within the `object_changes` and `object` columns stored by PaperTrail.
3.  Manually examine query results to identify any accidentally logged sensitive information that slipped through other preventative measures.
4.  Develop a process to redact or remove sensitive data from the `versions` table if found (with caution and consideration for audit trail integrity).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (Medium Severity) - Addresses existing instances of accidentally logged sensitive data that were not prevented proactively.

**Impact:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (Medium Reduction) - Provides a reactive measure to catch and remediate past mistakes, acting as a safety net.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Operational procedures, Database administration scripts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization Before Tracking](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_before_tracking.md)

**Description:**
1.  For attributes that must be tracked by PaperTrail for audit purposes but may contain sensitive data, implement sanitization *before* PaperTrail records the changes.
2.  Apply sanitization logic within model callbacks (e.g., `before_save`) or service objects *before* the record is saved and versioned by PaperTrail.
3.  Use techniques like masking (e.g., `************1234`), tokenization, or hashing to redact sensitive portions of the data before PaperTrail stores it.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (High Severity) - Prevents sensitive data from being stored in version history in a readable format, even when tracking is necessary.

**Impact:**
*   Sensitive Data Exposure in Version History (High Reduction) - Effectively mitigates sensitive data exposure within PaperTrail's version history by sanitizing data proactively.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Codebase (Model files, Service Objects)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Access Control for Version Data](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_access_control_for_version_data.md)

**Description:**
1.  Treat the `versions` table as highly sensitive data generated by PaperTrail.
2.  Restrict direct database access to the `versions` table to only authorized personnel (e.g., DBAs, auditors).
3.  Limit `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` permissions on the `versions` table for application users and less privileged roles to prevent unauthorized direct access to version history.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Version History (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized users from directly querying and accessing sensitive version history data stored by PaperTrail in the database.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Version History (High Reduction) - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized direct database access to PaperTrail's version data.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (Basic database roles exist, but specific restrictions on `versions` table for PaperTrail data not fully configured)

**Missing Implementation:** Database configuration (Specific permission restrictions on `versions` table for different roles)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Endpoints for Version Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_endpoints_for_version_access.md)

**Description:**
