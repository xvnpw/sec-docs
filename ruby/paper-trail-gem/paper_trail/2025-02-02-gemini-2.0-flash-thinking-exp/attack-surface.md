# Attack Surface Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Version History](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_version_history.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data tracked by PaperTrail and stored in the `versions` table can be exposed to unauthorized users if access controls are insufficient. This is a direct consequence of PaperTrail's functionality of recording changes.
*   **PaperTrail Contribution:** PaperTrail's core function is to track changes, and by default, it can track sensitive attributes if not configured carefully. This leads to sensitive data being persisted in the version history.
*   **Example:** A user's password reset token is temporarily stored in a user model attribute and tracked by PaperTrail. If version history access is not restricted, an attacker could potentially retrieve this token from the `versions` table even after it's been cleared from the current user record, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, PII exposure, potential identity theft, account takeover, regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Attribute Filtering (Critical):**  Utilize PaperTrail's `ignore` or `only` options in model configurations to **explicitly exclude** sensitive attributes from being tracked. This is the most direct way to prevent sensitive data from entering version history.
    *   **Strict Access Control (High):** Implement **robust authorization mechanisms** to severely restrict access to version history features and the `versions` table. Access should be limited to only essential personnel and audited regularly.
    *   **Data Sanitization Pre-Versioning (High):**  Before PaperTrail creates versions, implement application-level logic to **sanitize or redact sensitive data** within the tracked attributes. This ensures sensitive information is never persisted in version history.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest (High):** Encrypt the database at rest to protect sensitive data within the `versions` table from unauthorized physical access or database breaches.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Custom Serializers are Used)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_serializers_are_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If developers implement custom serializers for PaperTrail and use insecure deserialization methods, it can introduce **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities. This is a direct risk if PaperTrail's extensibility is misused.
*   **PaperTrail Contribution:** PaperTrail allows for the use of custom serializers to handle data serialization. If these custom serializers employ unsafe deserialization practices, they become a direct attack vector within the PaperTrail ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A custom serializer uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize data for versioned attributes. An attacker, through some vulnerability (even indirect), manages to inject malicious serialized data into the `versions` table. When this version is accessed and deserialized, it executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, significant business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Custom Serializers (Critical):**  **Prefer PaperTrail's default serializers** whenever possible. They are designed to be secure. Only use custom serializers if absolutely necessary and after thorough security review.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices (Critical):** If custom serializers are unavoidable, **absolutely avoid unsafe deserialization methods** like `Marshal.load` on potentially untrusted data. Use safer formats like JSON and secure deserialization libraries.
    *   **Input Validation for Serializers (High):** If custom serializers handle any form of external input or data that could be influenced by attackers, **rigorously validate and sanitize** this input before deserialization.
    *   **Code Review and Security Audit (High):**  **Mandatory security code reviews and audits** of any custom serializer implementations are crucial to identify and eliminate deserialization vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Mismanagement Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_mismanagement_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect or insecure configuration of PaperTrail, particularly regarding tracked attributes, can lead to the **unintentional logging of sensitive data** in version history, increasing the attack surface. This is a direct consequence of how PaperTrail is set up.
*   **PaperTrail Contribution:** PaperTrail's configuration directly dictates what data is tracked. Default or poorly considered configurations can easily result in sensitive information being logged without proper awareness of the security implications.
*   **Example:** Developers fail to use `ignore` or `only` options and PaperTrail defaults to tracking all attributes of user models, including fields intended for temporary storage of sensitive information during password reset or two-factor authentication processes. This sensitive data ends up permanently in the version history.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, PII exposure, potential identity theft, regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Configuration (High):**  **Proactively configure PaperTrail to track only the absolutely necessary attributes.**  Defaulting to tracking everything is insecure. Explicitly define what to track using `only` or `ignore` lists.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits (High):**  **Establish a process for regularly auditing PaperTrail configurations** to ensure they remain secure and aligned with data minimization principles. Review tracked attributes whenever models are modified or new sensitive data is introduced.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management (High):** Manage PaperTrail configurations as part of the application's overall secure configuration management strategy. Avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration details and use environment variables or secure configuration stores.
