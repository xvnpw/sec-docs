# Threat Model Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of Audit Logs](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of_audit_logs.md)

**Description:** An attacker, exploiting a vulnerability elsewhere or with compromised database access, directly modifies entries in PaperTrail's `versions` table. This involves altering data within columns like `whodunnit`, `created_at`, or `object_changes`, directly affecting the integrity of the audit trail managed by PaperTrail.

**Impact:** Loss of audit trail integrity, hindering accountability and potentially covering malicious actions tracked by PaperTrail.

**Affected Component:** `PaperTrail::Version` model, `versions` table (managed by PaperTrail).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust database access controls specifically for the `versions` table.
*   Harden the application against vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized database access.
*   Consider database-level audit logging (outside of PaperTrail) for an additional layer of security on the audit data itself.

## Threat: [Deletion of Audit Logs](./threats/deletion_of_audit_logs.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized database access directly deletes entries from PaperTrail's `versions` table, removing records of past changes tracked by PaperTrail.

**Impact:** Complete loss of audit trail data managed by PaperTrail, making it impossible to track changes and identify potential security incidents recorded by PaperTrail.

**Affected Component:** `PaperTrail::Version` model, `versions` table (managed by PaperTrail).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict database access controls, carefully managing permissions for deleting records from the `versions` table.
*   Implement soft-delete or archival mechanisms for PaperTrail's audit logs instead of direct deletion.
*   Regularly back up the `versions` table.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Audit Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_audit_logs.md)

**Description:** PaperTrail, by design, records changes to model attributes in the `object_changes` column. If sensitive data is present in tracked attributes and not explicitly ignored in PaperTrail's configuration, this sensitive data will be stored within PaperTrail's audit logs, potentially exposing it to unauthorized individuals who gain access to the `versions` table.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information directly through PaperTrail's stored audit data, leading to potential privacy breaches or security compromises.

**Affected Component:** `PaperTrail::Model::InstanceMethods#record_update`, `PaperTrail::Version#object_changes` attribute, `versions` table (managed by PaperTrail).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure PaperTrail's `ignore` option in your models to explicitly exclude sensitive attributes from being tracked.
*   Avoid storing sensitive data in model attributes that are tracked by PaperTrail if possible.
*   If absolutely necessary to track changes to sensitive data, implement data masking or redaction techniques *before* PaperTrail records the changes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Excessive Logging](./threats/denial_of_service_through_excessive_logging.md)

**Description:** If PaperTrail is configured to track changes for a large number of models or attributes without careful consideration, or if changes occur very frequently, the `versions` table managed by PaperTrail can grow rapidly. This can lead to increased database load specifically due to PaperTrail's logging activity, potentially impacting application performance.

**Impact:** Performance degradation specifically related to PaperTrail's logging operations, potentially leading to database overload and application slowdowns.

**Affected Component:** `PaperTrail.track` configuration, `PaperTrail::Model::InstanceMethods#record_update`, database write operations initiated by PaperTrail.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure which models and attributes are tracked by PaperTrail, only tracking what is necessary for audit purposes.
*   Consider using conditional logging within PaperTrail to reduce the volume of audit data.
*   Regularly archive or prune older audit logs from PaperTrail's `versions` table.
