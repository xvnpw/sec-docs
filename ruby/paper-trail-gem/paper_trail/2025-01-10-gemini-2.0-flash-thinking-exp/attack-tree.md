## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Version Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_version_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to directly manipulate the data stored in PaperTrail's `versions` table to hide malicious actions or create false audit trails.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Modification of Versions Table](./attack_tree_paths/direct_modification_of_versions_table.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains the ability to directly alter the records in the `versions` table. This can be achieved through:
    *   **SQL Injection in Version Retrieval/Display (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1. Identify application endpoints or functionalities that retrieve or display version data using PaperTrail's methods (e.g., `version.reify`, displaying version history).
            2. Craft malicious SQL queries by injecting code into input parameters that are used to construct database queries.
            3. Execute the crafted queries to modify existing version records (e.g., changing `object_changes`, `whodunnit`, `created_at`) or delete records entirely.
            4. This allows the attacker to cover their tracks by altering the audit log.
    *   **Direct Database Access (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1. Compromise database credentials through various means (e.g., exploiting application vulnerabilities, social engineering, insider threat).
            2. Gain direct access to the database server or a database client.
            3. Execute SQL commands to directly modify, insert, or delete records in the `versions` table.
            4. This provides complete control over the audit history, enabling sophisticated manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations in how PaperTrail is set up and used within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of Version Data](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_version_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application unintentionally stores sensitive information within the data tracked by PaperTrail.
    *   **Storing Sensitive Data in Versions (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1. Identify models that handle sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information).
            2. If these models are tracked by PaperTrail without proper configuration (e.g., using `only` or `ignore` options), the sensitive data will be stored in the `object` and `object_changes` columns of the `versions` table.
            3. An attacker gaining access to the `versions` table (even through read-only access in some scenarios) can then retrieve this sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Default Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_default_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses a weak or default PaperTrail configuration that leaves it vulnerable.
    *   **Disabled Versioning for Critical Models (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1. Identify critical ActiveRecord models whose changes should be audited for security or compliance reasons.
            2. If versioning is not enabled for these models in the PaperTrail configuration, any changes made to these models will not be recorded in the `versions` table.
            3. Attackers can then target these non-versioned models to perform malicious actions without leaving an audit trail.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Flaws in PaperTrail Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_flaws_in_papertrail_integration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits flaws in how the application integrates with PaperTrail, allowing actions to bypass the versioning mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Version Creation Logic](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_version_creation_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker finds ways to modify data without triggering PaperTrail's version creation callbacks.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Analyze the application's code to identify paths where data is modified on ActiveRecord models.
        2. Look for instances where data is updated using methods that bypass ActiveRecord callbacks (e.g., raw SQL queries, `update_columns`, `increment_counter` without callbacks, direct database manipulation).
        3. Perform actions through these bypass mechanisms to modify data without a corresponding version being created in the `versions` table.
        4. This allows attackers to make changes stealthily, as no record of their actions is created by PaperTrail.
