# Attack Surface Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Version History](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_version_history.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive information present in model attributes is stored in the `versions` table, making it accessible historically even if removed from the current record.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail's core function is to track changes, which includes storing snapshots of model data, inherently including sensitive attributes if not configured otherwise.

**Example:** A user's Social Security Number (SSN) is stored in a `User` model and updated. PaperTrail retains the version of the record containing the SSN even after it's removed or masked in the current record.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `versions` table leads to a data breach, exposing sensitive personal or confidential information, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or regulatory fines.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Attribute Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Configure PaperTrail to only track specific, non-sensitive attributes using `only` or `ignore` options.
* **Data Scrubbing/Masking:** Implement custom logic to sanitize or mask sensitive data before it's stored in the `versions` table (using callbacks or custom serializers).
* **Access Control on `versions` Table:** Restrict database access to the `versions` table to only authorized personnel or application components.
* **Data Retention Policies:** Implement policies to periodically purge or archive older version records containing sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Object Changes](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_object_changes.md)

**Description:** PaperTrail serializes object attributes (often using YAML by default) to store changes. If vulnerabilities exist in the deserialization process, malicious data in version records could lead to arbitrary code execution upon retrieval.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail's mechanism of storing object differences relies on serialization and deserialization. The choice of serialization format directly impacts this risk.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a model attribute in a way that, when serialized and later deserialized by PaperTrail, executes malicious code on the server. This is more likely with inherently unsafe formats like YAML.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Secure Serialization Formats:**  Avoid using inherently unsafe serialization formats like YAML. Consider using safer alternatives like JSON or implement custom, secure serialization.
* **Input Validation on Version Data (if applicable):** Although less common, if version data is processed in a way that allows user input to influence deserialization, implement strict validation.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Ensure PaperTrail and its dependencies (including serialization libraries) are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Audit Logs (if access is compromised)](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_audit_logs__if_access_is_compromised_.md)

**Description:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the database or application with sufficient privileges, they could potentially manipulate or delete version records to cover their tracks.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail stores audit information in a database table, making it a target for manipulation if access controls are weak.

**Example:** After successfully performing a malicious action, an attacker with database access directly deletes or modifies version records related to their activity to erase evidence.

**Impact:** Loss of audit integrity, making it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents or compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Database Access Controls:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for database access.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to database users and application components.
* **Audit Logging of Database Access:**  Log all access and modifications to the `versions` table itself.
* **Consider Immutable Audit Logs:** For highly sensitive environments, explore solutions that provide immutable audit logs, making tampering more difficult.
