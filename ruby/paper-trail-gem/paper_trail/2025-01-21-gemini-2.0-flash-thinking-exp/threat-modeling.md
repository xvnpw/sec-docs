# Threat Model Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Audit Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:** PaperTrail, by default, tracks changes to all model attributes. If sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information) is stored in these attributes and not explicitly ignored by PaperTrail, it will be recorded in the `versions` table. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the `versions` table could then view this sensitive information. Access could be gained through database breaches, SQL injection, or compromised application credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposing sensitive user or system data. This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `PaperTrail::Version` model, `versions` table (database), configuration options (`ignore`, `only`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure PaperTrail to ignore sensitive attributes using the `ignore` option in your model definitions.
        *   Consider using encryption at rest for the database to protect sensitive data even if the `versions` table is accessed.
        *   Implement strong access controls on the `versions` table, limiting read access to authorized personnel only.
        *   Regularly review the data stored in the `versions` table to ensure no unexpected sensitive information is being logged.

## Threat: [Loss of Audit Logs](./threats/loss_of_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidental administrative errors or malicious actions targeting the PaperTrail's storage mechanism (typically the `versions` table) could lead to the deletion or corruption of the audit logs. This could involve direct database manipulation or exploitation of vulnerabilities in database management tools.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of historical change data managed by PaperTrail, making it impossible to track past actions, investigate incidents, or comply with audit requirements.
    *   **Affected Component:** `versions` table (database), `PaperTrail` module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust database backup and recovery strategies, including regular automated backups stored in secure, separate locations.
        *   Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized deletion of the `versions` table or its backups.
        *   Consider using database features like point-in-time recovery to restore the `versions` table to a specific state.
        *   Regularly test the backup and recovery process to ensure its effectiveness.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PaperTrail Gem Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_papertrail_gem_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, PaperTrail might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities within its code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or its data, potentially through crafted requests or by leveraging specific functionalities of the gem.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** All PaperTrail components
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the PaperTrail gem updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review security advisories and changelogs for PaperTrail and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using tools like Dependabot or Snyk to automatically monitor and update dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
