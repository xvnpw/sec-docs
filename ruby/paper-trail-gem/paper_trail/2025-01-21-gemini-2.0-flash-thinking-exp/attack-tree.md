## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Disable PaperTrail Temporarily)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__disable_papertrail_temporarily_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target misconfigurations in the application's environment or feature flags that control PaperTrail's activation.
    *   **Mechanism:** By manipulating environment variables or toggling feature flags, attackers can temporarily disable PaperTrail, allowing them to perform actions without them being logged.
    *   **Impact:** Actions performed while PaperTrail is disabled will not be recorded, hindering auditing and potentially masking malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Model Methods Directly (Circumvent Model Callbacks)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_model_methods_directly__circumvent_model_callbacks_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with sufficient access (e.g., database access) bypass the application layer and directly modify data in the database.
    *   **Mechanism:** This circumvents PaperTrail's model callbacks, which are triggered by application-level data modifications. Direct SQL manipulation or the use of database triggers can achieve this.
    *   **Impact:** Data changes are made without PaperTrail being aware, leading to incomplete or inaccurate audit logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Access (Directly Modify PaperTrail Data & Gain Unauthorized Access)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_access__directly_modify_papertrail_data_&_gain_unauthorized_access_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the database credentials or exploit vulnerabilities to gain direct access to the database.
    *   **Mechanism:** Once inside the database, attackers can directly query, modify, or delete data within PaperTrail's tables (e.g., the `versions` table).
    *   **Impact:** This allows for the manipulation of historical records, deletion of audit logs, and unauthorized access to sensitive historical information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Manipulation (if attacker gains database access)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_manipulation__if_attacker_gains_database_access_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a specific instance of exploiting database access, focusing on the direct modification of PaperTrail data.
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers with database access use SQL commands to alter or delete entries in PaperTrail's tables, effectively rewriting history.
    *   **Impact:** Historical records can be falsified or removed, obscuring malicious activity and compromising the integrity of the audit trail.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in `object_changes`](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in__object_changes_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the way PaperTrail stores changes in the `object_changes` column, which is often serialized (e.g., using YAML or JSON).
    *   **Mechanism:** If custom serializers are used and are vulnerable to deserialization attacks, attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed when the data is deserialized.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application server or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation to Access Admin Audit Logs](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation_to_access_admin_audit_logs.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the application to elevate their privileges to an administrative level.
    *   **Mechanism:** By exploiting flaws in authorization or authentication mechanisms, attackers gain access to administrative accounts or roles.
    *   **Impact:** With elevated privileges, attackers can access more sensitive audit logs, potentially revealing information about administrative actions and system configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Access Controls (if PaperTrail data is not properly secured)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_access_controls__if_papertrail_data_is_not_properly_secured_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in the database's access control mechanisms.
    *   **Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the database software, brute-forcing credentials, or leveraging misconfigurations in user permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation grants direct read access to the database containing PaperTrail data, allowing attackers to view all historical records.
