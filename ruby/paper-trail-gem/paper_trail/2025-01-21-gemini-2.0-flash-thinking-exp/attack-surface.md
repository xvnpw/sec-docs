# Attack Surface Analysis for paper-trail-gem/paper_trail

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Version History](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_version_history.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) present in tracked model attributes is stored in the `versions` table.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail's core function is to record changes to model attributes, including potentially sensitive ones, in the `versions` table.

**Example:** A user's address is tracked. When the user updates their address, both the old and new addresses are stored in the `versions` table. If this data is accessed without proper authorization, the old address (which might be sensitive) is exposed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive historical data, leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or other security incidents.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully select which attributes are tracked using PaperTrail's `:only` and `:ignore` options.
*   Implement attribute-level filtering to redact or exclude sensitive data before it's stored in the `versions` table.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at the application level before it's tracked by PaperTrail.
*   Implement robust access controls for the `versions` table itself at the database level.

## Attack Surface: [Data Integrity Manipulation in `versions` Table](./attack_surfaces/data_integrity_manipulation_in__versions__table.md)

**Description:** Attackers with write access to the `versions` table can modify or delete historical records, compromising the audit trail.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail relies on the integrity of the `versions` table for its audit logging functionality. If this table is writable by unauthorized parties, the audit trail becomes unreliable.

**Example:** An attacker gains SQL injection access and modifies the `whodunnit` column in a version record to attribute a malicious action to a different user.

**Impact:** Compromised audit trails, making it difficult to identify the source of malicious activity or to perform accurate forensic analysis.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the database and prevent unauthorized write access to the `versions` table.
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization throughout the application to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using database-level triggers or write-only database users for PaperTrail to limit the potential for manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (with Custom Serializers)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__with_custom_serializers_.md)

**Description:** If a custom serializer is used for the `object` or `object_changes` columns, it could introduce deserialization vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.

**How PaperTrail Contributes:** PaperTrail allows for custom serializers, and if a vulnerable serializer is used, it can be exploited when reading version data.

**Example:** A custom serializer uses `Marshal.load` without proper safeguards. An attacker could inject malicious serialized data into the database, which, when loaded by PaperTrail, executes arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using custom serializers unless absolutely necessary.
*   If a custom serializer is required, ensure it is implemented securely and does not have known deserialization vulnerabilities. Prefer safe serialization formats like JSON.
*   Regularly update the serializer library if it's a third-party dependency.
