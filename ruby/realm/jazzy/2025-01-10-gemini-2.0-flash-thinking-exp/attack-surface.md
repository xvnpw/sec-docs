# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* Description: Jazzy relies on third-party libraries (Ruby gems). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
* How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface: By including these dependencies, Jazzy introduces the attack surface of those libraries into the project's build process and potentially the generated documentation.
* Example: A vulnerability in a gem used for HTML templating could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the generated documentation.
* Impact: Compromise of the build environment, introduction of vulnerabilities (like XSS) into the generated documentation, potential information disclosure.
* Risk Severity: High
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update Jazzy and all its Ruby gem dependencies.
    * Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    * Pin dependency versions to ensure consistent and tested builds.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Documentation](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_documentation.md)

* Description: Vulnerabilities in Jazzy's processing of source code comments or configuration can lead to the generation of HTML with XSS flaws.
* How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface: Jazzy parses source code comments and uses them to generate documentation. If input is not properly sanitized or escaped, malicious scripts can be injected.
* Example: A developer might include a comment containing a malicious `<script>` tag, which Jazzy includes verbatim in the generated HTML.
* Impact: Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the documentation, potentially stealing user credentials, performing actions on behalf of users, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
* Risk Severity: High
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Ensure Jazzy (or its underlying libraries) properly sanitizes and escapes user-provided content from source code comments and configuration.
    * Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the generated documentation to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    * Regularly review the generated documentation for any unexpected or suspicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Build Environment Compromise Leading to Malicious Documentation](./attack_surfaces/build_environment_compromise_leading_to_malicious_documentation.md)

* Description: If the environment where Jazzy is executed (e.g., CI/CD pipeline) is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the Jazzy installation or its dependencies to inject malicious content.
* How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface: Jazzy relies on the integrity of the environment where it runs. If that environment is compromised, Jazzy becomes a vector for injecting malicious content.
* Example: An attacker could modify the Jazzy executable or a dependency within the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious JavaScript into every generated documentation build.
* Impact: Widespread distribution of compromised documentation, potentially affecting many users.
* Risk Severity: Critical
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Harden the build environment and follow secure CI/CD practices.
    * Regularly scan the build environment for vulnerabilities.
    * Implement integrity checks for Jazzy and its dependencies before execution.
