# Threat Model Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection During Documentation Generation](./threats/malicious_code_injection_during_documentation_generation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the codebase could inject malicious code within comments or code blocks that, when processed by Jazzy, leads to arbitrary code execution on the machine running Jazzy. The attacker might craft specific input that exploits vulnerabilities in Jazzy's parsing logic or the underlying tools it uses (like SourceKit).

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on the build server or developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Jazzy's parsing module, specifically the components responsible for processing comments and code blocks (potentially leveraging SourceKit integration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes to identify and prevent the introduction of malicious code or comments.
* Run Jazzy in a sandboxed or containerized environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of potential code execution.
* Keep Jazzy and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider static analysis tools to identify potentially dangerous code patterns before documentation generation.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Jazzy relies on various Ruby gems and potentially other system libraries. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the system running Jazzy. This could involve leveraging publicly known exploits against outdated or vulnerable versions of these libraries.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service on the build server or developer's machine, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.

**Affected Component:** Jazzy's dependency management system (e.g., Bundler) and the specific vulnerable Ruby gems or system libraries it relies on.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit Jazzy's dependencies using tools like `bundle audit` or similar vulnerability scanners.
* Keep Jazzy and all its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
* Consider using dependency pinning to ensure consistent and known versions of dependencies and to facilitate easier vulnerability management.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.
