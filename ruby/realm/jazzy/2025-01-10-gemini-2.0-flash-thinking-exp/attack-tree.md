## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code in Documentation Comments](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_in_documentation_comments.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious code, often JavaScript, and embeds it within documentation comments of the Swift or Objective-C code.
    * Exploitation: When Jazzy processes these comments and generates documentation (e.g., HTML), the malicious code is included in the output. When a user views the documentation in their browser, the malicious script executes.
    * Potential Impact: Client-side code execution, leading to actions like stealing cookies or session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the documentation page.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Jazzy's Dependencies (e.g., Ruby Gems)](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_vulnerabilities_in_jazzy's_dependencies__e_g___ruby_gems_.md)

* Attack Vector: Jazzy relies on various third-party libraries (Ruby Gems). Attackers identify publicly known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
    * Exploitation: By providing specific input or triggering certain conditions during Jazzy's execution, attackers can leverage these known vulnerabilities. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running Jazzy.
    * Potential Impact: Server-side code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input Reflection](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input_reflection.md)

* Attack Vector: User-provided data (e.g., from documentation comments) is not properly sanitized or encoded before being included in the generated HTML output.
    * Exploitation: An attacker crafts input containing malicious JavaScript. When Jazzy generates the documentation, this script is included verbatim. When a user views the documentation, the browser executes the attacker's script.
    * Potential Impact: Client-side code execution, enabling actions like session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of Jazzy](./attack_tree_paths/using_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_jazzy.md)

* Attack Vector: The development team uses an outdated version of Jazzy that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    * Exploitation: Attackers identify these known vulnerabilities and craft exploits specifically targeting the outdated version of Jazzy.
    * Potential Impact: Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version. This could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Jazzy's Processing](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_jazzy's_processing.md)

* Represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to inject malicious code that gets executed during Jazzy's operation. This could be through input manipulation, exploiting parsing flaws, or leveraging vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node highlights the risk of insufficient input validation and sanitization, making Jazzy susceptible to various injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Jazzy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_jazzy.md)

* Emphasizes the risk associated with using third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be a significant attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jazzy's Output (Generated Documentation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jazzy's_output__generated_documentation_.md)

* Focuses on the risks associated with the content generated by Jazzy, particularly the potential for injecting malicious scripts that can harm users viewing the documentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations or Insecure Usage of Jazzy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_or_insecure_usage_of_jazzy.md)

* This node highlights the risks arising from improper setup or usage of Jazzy, which can amplify the impact of underlying vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Running Jazzy with Elevated Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/running_jazzy_with_elevated_privileges.md)

* A critical misconfiguration where Jazzy is run with more permissions than necessary. This means that if an attacker gains code execution through Jazzy, they will have those elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing the Generated Documentation in Insecure Environments](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_the_generated_documentation_in_insecure_environments.md)

* A critical misconfiguration where the generated documentation is hosted on a vulnerable server or without proper access controls, making it easier for attackers to exploit any vulnerabilities within the documentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of Jazzy](./attack_tree_paths/using_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_jazzy.md)

* A critical misconfiguration where the development team fails to keep Jazzy updated, leaving known vulnerabilities unpatched and exploitable.
