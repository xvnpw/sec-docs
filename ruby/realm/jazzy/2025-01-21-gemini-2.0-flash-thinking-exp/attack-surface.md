# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code/Markup in Comments (Leading to XSS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_codemarkup_in_comments__leading_to_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (typically JavaScript or HTML) into source code comments. When Jazzy processes these comments and generates documentation, the malicious code is included in the output HTML.
    *   **How Jazzy Contributes:** Jazzy parses and renders comments, including Markdown or other supported formats, into HTML. If Jazzy doesn't properly sanitize or escape these comments, it can inadvertently include active malicious code in the generated documentation.
    *   **Example:** A developer includes a comment like `/*! <script>alert("XSS");</script> */` in their Swift code. Jazzy, without proper sanitization, renders this directly into the HTML documentation, causing an alert box to appear when a user views the documentation.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated documentation can allow attackers to:
        *   Steal user cookies and session tokens.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Deface the documentation website.
        *   Potentially gain access to user accounts if the documentation is hosted on a site with authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization/Escaping in Jazzy:**  Jazzy developers should implement robust input sanitization and output escaping mechanisms to prevent the inclusion of malicious scripts in the generated HTML.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Developers hosting the generated documentation should implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   **Code Review:**  Developers should carefully review source code comments to identify and remove any suspicious or potentially malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Overwrite via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_overwrite_via_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how Jazzy processes its configuration file (`.jazzy.yaml`) could allow an attacker to manipulate settings, potentially leading to the overwriting of arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **How Jazzy Contributes:** Jazzy reads and interprets the `.jazzy.yaml` file to determine output paths and other settings. If there are flaws in how these paths are handled, an attacker could potentially specify a path outside the intended documentation directory.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor modifies the `.jazzy.yaml` file (if they have write access) to set the output path to a critical system file like `/etc/passwd`. When Jazzy runs, it attempts to write documentation to this location, potentially corrupting or overwriting the file.
    *   **Impact:**  Data loss, system instability, potential for privilege escalation if critical system files are overwritten.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Parsing:** Jazzy developers should implement robust validation and sanitization of configuration file values, especially file paths, to prevent writing outside of allowed directories.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run Jazzy with the minimum necessary permissions to perform its task. Avoid running it as root or with elevated privileges.
        *   **File System Permissions:** Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to restrict who can modify the `.jazzy.yaml` file.
