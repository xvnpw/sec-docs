# Threat Model Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Documentation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_documentation.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., within Swift or Objective-C code comments using Markdown syntax) that, when processed by Jazzy, results in the generation of HTML containing embedded JavaScript. When a user views the generated documentation, this script executes in their browser. The attacker might attempt to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a phishing site, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Affected Component:** Jazzy's HTML generation module, specifically the components responsible for parsing and rendering Markdown from code comments and documentation markup.
### Impact:
- User session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
- Theft of sensitive information stored in browser cookies or local storage.
- Redirection to malicious websites, potentially leading to malware infection or further phishing attacks.
- Defacement of the documentation website.
### Risk Severity:** High
### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Developers:**
    - Update Jazzy to the latest version to benefit from potential security fixes related to input sanitization and output encoding.
    - Carefully review Jazzy's configuration options related to HTML escaping and sanitization. Ensure they are configured to be as strict as possible.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any user-provided data that might be incorporated into code comments or documentation.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Jazzy](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_jazzy.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the Jazzy project's infrastructure (e.g., through a compromised maintainer account, build server, or repository) and injects malicious code into a release of Jazzy. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised version.
- **Affected Component:** The entire Jazzy application and its distribution mechanisms (e.g., GitHub releases, package managers).
### Impact:
- Execution of arbitrary code on the developer's machine during documentation generation.
- Injection of malicious content into the generated documentation.
- Potential compromise of the development environment and source code.
### Risk Severity:** High
### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Developers:**
    - Download Jazzy from official and verified sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository).
    - Verify the integrity of downloaded Jazzy binaries using checksums or signatures provided by the maintainers.
    - Stay informed about any security advisories or announcements related to Jazzy.
    - Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools that can detect known vulnerabilities or malicious components in dependencies.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of Jazzy's third-party dependencies. They might then attempt to exploit this vulnerability if Jazzy uses the vulnerable version. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain actions within Jazzy to leverage the dependency's flaw.
- **Affected Component:** Jazzy's dependency management system and the specific vulnerable third-party library.
### Impact:
- Remote code execution on the server or machine running Jazzy.
- Denial of service by exploiting a vulnerability that causes resource exhaustion.
- Information disclosure if the vulnerability allows access to sensitive data.
### Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Developers:**
    - Regularly update Jazzy to the latest version, which typically includes updates to its dependencies.
    - Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to identify and receive alerts about vulnerabilities in Jazzy's dependencies.
    - Investigate and address reported vulnerabilities promptly by updating Jazzy or its dependencies manually if necessary.
    - Consider using a dependency management tool that provides vulnerability scanning and management features.
