```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jazzy's Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jazzy's_code.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks targeting flaws within Jazzy's codebase itself. Successful exploitation can lead to direct control over the server or sensitive data.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Dependency Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **[HIGH RISK] Exploit Vulnerable Dependency:** Jazzy relies on third-party libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them. This often involves identifying outdated dependencies and using publicly available exploits. The impact can range from arbitrary code execution to data breaches.
    * Code Injection Vulnerabilities:
        * **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious Code via Source Code Comments/Docstrings (leading to execution during parsing):** If Jazzy doesn't properly sanitize input from source code comments or docstrings, attackers might inject code that gets executed during the documentation generation process. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:
        * **[HIGH RISK] Access Sensitive Files on the Server:** If Jazzy allows manipulation of file paths during its operation, attackers could potentially access sensitive files on the server.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Overwrite Critical Files:**  Similar to accessing files, attackers could potentially overwrite critical system or application files, leading to system instability or compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**[HIGH RISK] Exploit Vulnerable Dependency:** Jazzy relies on third-party libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them. This often involves identifying outdated dependencies and using publicly available exploits. The impact can range from arbitrary code execution to data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jazzy's Processing of Malicious Input](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jazzy's_processing_of_malicious_input.md)

* This category focuses on attacks that exploit how Jazzy handles and processes data, particularly from source code.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Documentation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious JavaScript via Source Code Comments/Docstrings:** If Jazzy doesn't sanitize content from source code comments or docstrings when generating HTML documentation, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser Viewing Documentation:** When a user views the generated documentation, the injected script will execute in their browser.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Steal Cookies/Session Tokens:** Attackers can steal user session information, leading to account takeover.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Redirect User to Malicious Site:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites or sites hosting malware.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:** Attackers can perform actions on the application as if they were the logged-in user.
    * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Jazzy:
        * Access Internal Services [HIGH RISK]: By injecting malicious URLs into source code comments, attackers could trick Jazzy into making requests to internal services that are not publicly accessible.
        * Exfiltrate Data [HIGH RISK]: Attackers could potentially use Jazzy to make requests to external servers, sending sensitive data from the internal network.
    * Command Injection via Jazzy:
        * **[HIGH RISK] Execute Arbitrary Commands on the Server:** If Jazzy improperly handles or executes commands based on input (e.g., from comments), attackers could inject malicious commands to gain control of the server.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Gain Shell Access:** Successful command injection can allow attackers to obtain a shell on the server.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Modify System Files:** Attackers can modify critical system files, leading to system compromise.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Install Malware:** Attackers can install malware on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Documentation](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_documentation.md)

* **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious JavaScript via Source Code Comments/Docstrings:** If Jazzy doesn't sanitize content from source code comments or docstrings when generating HTML documentation, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser Viewing Documentation:** When a user views the generated documentation, the injected script will execute in their browser.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Steal Cookies/Session Tokens:** Attackers can steal user session information, leading to account takeover.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Redirect User to Malicious Site:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites or sites hosting malware.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:** Attackers can perform actions on the application as if they were the logged-in user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Development Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_development_environment.md)

**[HIGH RISK PATH] Attacker Gains Access to Developer Machine [HIGH RISK]:** If an attacker compromises a developer's machine, they gain the ability to directly manipulate the application's codebase and build process.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Modify Source Code with Malicious Intent:** Attackers can insert backdoors or vulnerabilities directly into the application's source code.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious Code into Jazzy Configuration:** Attackers can modify Jazzy's configuration to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior during the documentation generation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on Jazzy Distribution](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_jazzy_distribution.md)

**[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Jazzy's Repository or Release Process [HIGH RISK]:** If an attacker can compromise Jazzy's official repository or the process used to release new versions, they can inject malicious code into the distributed version of Jazzy.
        * **[HIGH RISK] Distribute Backdoored Version of Jazzy:** A compromised version of Jazzy will be distributed to developers.
            * **[HIGH RISK] Application unknowingly uses compromised Jazzy:** Applications using the backdoored version of Jazzy will be vulnerable.
