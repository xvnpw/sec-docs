### High and Critical Jazzy Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Jazzy documentation generator:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Source Comments
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the source code repository injects malicious code within documentation comments. Jazzy's parser interprets these comments, and the malicious code is executed *by Jazzy* during the documentation generation process. This could involve executing arbitrary commands on the build server or manipulating the generated documentation content *through Jazzy's actions*.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks. Manipulation of documentation can lead to misinformation or social engineering attacks against users.
    *   **Affected Jazzy Component:** Parser (specifically the comment parsing logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all changes, especially to documentation comments.
        *   Enforce branch protection and access controls on the source code repository.
        *   Run Jazzy in a sandboxed or isolated environment with limited permissions.
        *   Consider static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious code patterns in comments.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion during Parsing
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted source code with extremely complex or deeply nested structures within comments or code. When *Jazzy* attempts to parse this code, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition on the build server.
    *   **Impact:**  Build process disruption, delays in software releases, potential infrastructure instability.
    *   **Affected Jazzy Component:** Parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts and resource limits for the Jazzy process.
        *   Monitor resource usage during documentation generation.
        *   Consider input sanitization or complexity analysis before passing source code to Jazzy.
        *   Update Jazzy to the latest version, as newer versions may have improved resource management.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Generated Documentation
    *   **Description:** *Jazzy* fails to properly sanitize user-provided content within documentation comments or symbol names. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the generated HTML documentation *by exploiting Jazzy's output generation logic*. When users view this documentation, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts viewing the documentation, potential data breaches, defacement of documentation websites.
    *   **Affected Jazzy Component:** Output Generator (specifically the HTML generation logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Jazzy uses proper output encoding and sanitization techniques to prevent XSS.
        *   Review Jazzy's release notes and changelogs for any reported XSS vulnerabilities and update accordingly.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web server hosting the documentation to mitigate the impact of potential XSS attacks.
        *   Perform security testing on the generated documentation to identify and fix any XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Jazzy Installation or Binary
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Jazzy installation or the Jazzy binary itself, potentially through a supply chain attack. This compromised version of *Jazzy* could inject malicious code into the generated documentation or perform other malicious actions *as part of its core functionality*.
    *   **Impact:**  Severe compromise of the build process, potential injection of malware into the application's documentation, supply chain attacks.
    *   **Affected Jazzy Component:** Entire Jazzy application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain Jazzy from trusted sources and verify its integrity (e.g., using checksums).
        *   Secure the build environment and restrict access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems on the build infrastructure.
