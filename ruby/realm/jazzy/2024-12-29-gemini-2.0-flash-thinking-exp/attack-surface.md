* **Attack Surface: Malicious Code Injection via Source Code Comments**
    * **Description:** Jazzy parses source code comments to generate documentation. If developers inadvertently or maliciously include executable code (e.g., JavaScript within HTML comments) in the comments, Jazzy might render it in the generated documentation.
    * **How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jazzy's core function of parsing and rendering comments makes it a vehicle for injecting malicious code into the generated documentation.
    * **Example:** A developer includes a comment like `<!-- <script>alert('XSS')</script> -->` in their code. When Jazzy generates the documentation, this script will be executed in the browser of anyone viewing the documentation.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated documentation, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Educate developers on secure coding practices for comments, emphasizing the avoidance of executable code.
        * Implement code review processes to identify and remove potentially malicious code in comments.
        * Consider using linters or static analysis tools that can detect suspicious patterns in comments.
        * If possible, configure Jazzy or use post-processing steps to sanitize the generated HTML output.

* **Attack Surface: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Configuration**
    * **Description:** Jazzy's configuration file (`.jazzy.yaml`) allows specifying input and output paths. Improperly sanitized or validated paths could allow an attacker to read or write files outside the intended documentation directory.
    * **How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The configuration mechanism provided by Jazzy, if not carefully implemented, can introduce path traversal risks.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `.jazzy.yaml` file and modifies the `output` path to `../../../sensitive_data`. When Jazzy runs, it might overwrite or expose sensitive files.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized file modification, or potentially gaining access to the underlying system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict access to the Jazzy configuration file to authorized personnel only.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for path configurations within Jazzy.
        * Run Jazzy with the least necessary privileges.
        * Regularly review the Jazzy configuration file for any suspicious or unexpected paths.

* **Attack Surface: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Generated Documentation**
    * **Description:** Jazzy might inadvertently include sensitive information present in the source code comments or code structure within the generated documentation.
    * **How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By automatically generating documentation from code and comments, Jazzy can unintentionally expose information that should remain private.
    * **Example:** A developer includes an API key or internal URL within a comment intended for internal documentation. Jazzy includes this in the publicly generated documentation.
    * **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials, internal URLs, or other confidential information, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Educate developers on what information is appropriate for public documentation.
        * Implement code review processes to identify and remove sensitive information from comments intended for public documentation.
        * Consider using tools or scripts to automatically scan generated documentation for potential secrets.
        * Differentiate between internal and external documentation generation processes if necessary.

* **Attack Surface: Compromised Jazzy Executable or Dependencies (Supply Chain Attack)**
    * **Description:** If the Jazzy gem itself or its dependencies are compromised (e.g., through a malicious update on a package repository), running Jazzy could introduce malicious code into the development environment.
    * **How Jazzy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By relying on external packages, Jazzy inherits the risk of supply chain attacks targeting those packages.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of the Jazzy gem on RubyGems.org and releases a compromised version. Developers unknowingly install this version, which contains malware.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the development environment, data exfiltration, code injection, and further propagation of the attack.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use trusted package repositories and verify the integrity of downloaded packages (e.g., using checksums).
        * Employ security scanning tools that can detect malicious code in dependencies.
        * Consider using private or mirrored package repositories for better control over dependencies.
        * Regularly review and audit the list of dependencies used by Jazzy.
