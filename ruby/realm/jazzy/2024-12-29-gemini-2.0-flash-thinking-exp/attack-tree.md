            *   Inject Malicious Code via Source Comments/Docstrings [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Leverage Vulnerable Ruby Gems
*   Manipulate Generated Documentation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Inject Malicious Content into Documentation [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Inject Malicious JavaScript via Source Comments/Docstrings
*   Exploit Configuration or Usage Weaknesses
    *   Exposing Jazzy's Interface or Output Directory Publicly [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Input Sanitization Flaws -> Inject Malicious Code via Source Comments/Docstrings -> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Jazzy:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious code within Swift or Objective-C comments or docstrings that are processed by Jazzy.
    *   Mechanism: Jazzy fails to properly sanitize or escape these inputs. When Jazzy processes the code, the malicious code is executed on the server or during the documentation generation process.
    *   Potential Impact: Full control over the server where Jazzy is running, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks on the application.

*   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Leverage Vulnerable Ruby Gems -> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Jazzy:**
    *   Attack Vector: Jazzy relies on external Ruby gems. Attackers target known vulnerabilities within these dependencies.
    *   Mechanism: By exploiting vulnerabilities in gems like `nokogiri` (for XML/HTML parsing) or other dependencies, an attacker can achieve remote code execution during Jazzy's execution.
    *   Potential Impact: Similar to input sanitization flaws, RCE can lead to full server compromise.

*   **Inject Malicious JavaScript via Source Comments/Docstrings -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input -> Inject Malicious Content into Documentation -> Manipulate Generated Documentation:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within source code comments or docstrings.
    *   Mechanism: Jazzy fails to properly sanitize or escape these inputs when generating the HTML documentation. When users view the generated documentation in their browsers, the malicious JavaScript code is executed.
    *   Potential Impact: Compromise of user accounts viewing the documentation, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, or other client-side attacks.

*   **Exposing Jazzy's Interface or Output Directory Publicly:**
    *   Attack Vector: The directory where Jazzy generates the documentation is made publicly accessible without proper security measures.
    *   Mechanism: Attackers can directly access the generated documentation files. This can expose potentially vulnerable documentation containing XSS vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
    *   Potential Impact: Exposure of potentially vulnerable documentation, information disclosure, and the possibility of exploiting client-side vulnerabilities within the documentation.

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jazzy's Codebase:**
    *   Description: This represents the broad category of exploiting security flaws directly within Jazzy's own code.
    *   Significance: Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like RCE.

*   **Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Jazzy:**
    *   Description:  The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server where Jazzy is running.
    *   Significance: This is a highly critical outcome, granting the attacker significant control over the system.

*   **Exploit Input Sanitization Flaws:**
    *   Description: Jazzy fails to properly clean or validate user-supplied input (in this case, from source code).
    *   Significance: This is a common vulnerability that can lead to various attacks, including RCE and XSS.

*   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Description: Jazzy relies on external libraries or components that have known security weaknesses.
    *   Significance: Exploiting these vulnerabilities can provide an entry point for attackers.

*   **Manipulate Generated Documentation:**
    *   Description: The attacker aims to alter the content of the documentation produced by Jazzy.
    *   Significance: This can be used to inject malicious content targeting users who view the documentation.

*   **Inject Malicious Content into Documentation:**
    *   Description: The attacker successfully inserts harmful content (like JavaScript code or malicious links) into the generated documentation.
    *   Significance: This directly leads to attacks targeting users of the documentation.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input:**
    *   Description: Jazzy fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided input when generating web content, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
    *   Significance: XSS is a common and impactful vulnerability in web applications.
