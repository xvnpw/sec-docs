# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Use of Access Control Modifiers (with Jazzy in mind)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_use_of_access_control_modifiers__with_jazzy_in_mind_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Codebase:** Systematically examine all Swift and Objective-C code.
2.  **Identify Public API:** Determine which elements are intended for the *public* API.
3.  **Apply `public` or `open`:** Mark *only* the intended public API with `public` or `open`.
4.  **Apply `internal`:** Use `internal` for elements within the same module.
5.  **Apply `fileprivate`:** Use `fileprivate` for elements within the *same source file*.
6.  **Apply `private`:** Use `private` for elements within the *enclosing declaration*.
7.  **Consistency Check:** Regularly review to ensure consistent and correct usage.
8.  **Jazzy Consideration:** Keep in mind that `jazzy` will, by default, document `public`, `open`, and `internal` elements. Use `private` and `fileprivate` to *prevent* documentation generation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs (Severity: High):** Prevents internal details from being included in the generated documentation.
    *   **Accidental Public Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally making internal components public.
    *   **Information Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Limits the amount of information about internal structure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs:** Significantly reduces the risk (primary defense).
    *   **Accidental Public Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Information Leakage:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example: "Partially implemented. Access control modifiers are used in `CoreData` and `Networking`, but inconsistently in `UI` and `Utilities`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example: "Missing in `LegacyCode` and helper classes in `Utilities`. `StringExtensions.swift` and `DateHelpers.swift` lack consistent access control."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use of `--min-acl` Flag](./mitigation_strategies/use_of__--min-acl__flag.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Minimum Access Level:** Determine the minimum access level for documentation (usually `public` for libraries, `internal` for some apps).
2.  **Modify `jazzy` Command:** Add `--min-acl` followed by the access level (e.g., `jazzy --min-acl public`).
3.  **Integrate into Build Process:** Ensure this command is used consistently (build script or CI/CD).
4.  **Test:** Run `jazzy` and verify the documentation includes only elements with the specified level or higher.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs (Severity: High):** "Fail-safe" to prevent internal APIs from being included.
    *   **Accidental Public Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Reinforces the intended public API.
    *   **Inconsistent Access Control (Severity: Medium):** Mitigates inconsistent access control modifier use.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs:** Significantly reduces risk (backup to access control).
    *   **Accidental Public Exposure:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Inconsistent Access Control:** Moderately reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example: "Implemented in `generate_docs.sh`, run as part of CI/CD."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example: "Not used in local development builds. Developers need to be reminded to use the flag."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use of `--exclude` Flag](./mitigation_strategies/use_of__--exclude__flag.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Files/Directories to Exclude:** Determine files/directories to *never* include (e.g., internal helpers, tests).
2.  **Modify `jazzy` Command:** Add `--exclude` followed by a comma-separated list of files/directories (e.g., `jazzy --exclude Source/Internal/*,Tests/*`).
3.  **Integrate into Build Process:** Ensure consistent use (build script or CI/CD).
4.  **Test:** Run `jazzy` and verify excluded files/directories are not in the documentation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs (Severity: High):** Excludes entire code sections, regardless of access control.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Code (Severity: High):** Excludes files with sensitive details.
    *   **Inclusion of Irrelevant Code (Severity: Low):** Prevents test files, etc., from cluttering documentation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal APIs:** Significantly reduces risk for excluded files/directories.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Code:** Significantly reduces risk for excluded files/directories.
    *   **Inclusion of Irrelevant Code:** Eliminates risk for excluded files/directories.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example: "Implemented in `generate_docs.sh`. Excludes `Tests` and files matching `*Internal.swift`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example: "Not used to exclude specific files in `Utilities`, even though some helper classes should be excluded."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use of `//:nodoc:` Comment Tag](./mitigation_strategies/use_of__nodoc__comment_tag.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Elements to Exclude:** Identify specific code elements to exclude, even if `public` or `internal`.
2.  **Add `//:nodoc:` Tag:** *Before* the element, add `//:nodoc:` (e.g., `//:nodoc: public func helper() { ... }`).
3.  **Test:** Run `jazzy` and verify marked elements are excluded.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Specific Internal Elements (Severity: Medium):** Fine-grained control over included elements.
    *   **Temporary Exclusion (Severity: Low):** Temporarily hide parts of the API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Specific Internal Elements:** Significantly reduces risk for marked elements.
    *   **Temporary Exclusion:** Convenient for temporary hiding.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example: "Used sporadically, primarily in `Networking` to exclude internal helpers."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example: "Not consistently used. Many internal helpers within public classes are not marked."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `jazzy` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__jazzy__updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for new `jazzy` (and SourceKitten) versions:
    *   `jazzy` GitHub repository
    *   SourceKitten GitHub repository
    *   Dependency manager
2.  **Update Dependencies:** Update to new versions, following instructions.
3.  **Test:** Run `jazzy` and verify correct documentation generation, no regressions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `jazzy` (Severity: Low to High):** Updates often include security patches.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in SourceKitten (Severity: Low to High):** Updating `jazzy` often updates SourceKitten.
    *   **Bugs and Compatibility Issues (Severity: Low):** Updates fix bugs, improve compatibility.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `jazzy` and SourceKitten:** Reduces risk (potentially significantly).
    *   **Bugs and Compatibility Issues:** Improves stability and reliability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example: "Dependencies managed through Swift Package Manager, updates checked weekly."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example: "No automated update checks. Relies on manual checks."
