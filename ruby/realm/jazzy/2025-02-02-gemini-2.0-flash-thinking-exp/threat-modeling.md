# Threat Model Analysis for realm/jazzy

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Comments or Code Snippets](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_comments_or_code_snippets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious comments or code snippets within Swift/Objective-C source code. Jazzy's parser, if vulnerable, interprets these as commands. The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server or developer machine running Jazzy during documentation generation. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities.
*   **Impact:**  System compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breach, supply chain contamination if malicious code is injected into generated documentation and distributed.
*   **Jazzy Component Affected:** Parser (specifically the comment and code parsing logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Jazzy to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Report any suspicious parsing behavior or potential vulnerabilities to the Jazzy maintainers.
    *   Consider code review processes to identify and remove potentially malicious comments or code snippets before documentation generation.
    *   Run Jazzy in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Jazzy relies on Ruby gems. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the Jazzy execution environment. This could lead to various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:**  System compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breach, privilege escalation, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Jazzy Component Affected:** Dependency Management (Ruby gem dependencies).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Jazzy and all its Ruby gem dependencies using `bundle update`.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools like `bundler-audit` to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in Jazzy's dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for monitoring security advisories for Ruby gems and proactively patching vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dependency management tool that provides vulnerability scanning and alerting features.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the RubyGems repository or a source of Jazzy's dependencies. They inject malicious versions of gems. When developers install or update Jazzy or its dependencies, they unknowingly download and install the compromised gems, introducing malicious code into their development environment and potentially into generated documentation.
*   **Impact:**  Supply chain contamination, widespread compromise of developer machines and systems using Jazzy, potential distribution of malware through generated documentation, data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Jazzy Component Affected:** Dependency Management, Installation Process (gem installation).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted and reputable gem sources (e.g., the official RubyGems repository, but be aware of its potential risks).
    *   Implement dependency verification mechanisms (like checksum verification if available and practical).
    *   Regularly audit Jazzy's dependencies and their sources.
    *   Consider using a private gem repository or mirroring trusted sources to reduce the risk of supply chain compromise.
    *   Employ security scanning tools that can detect malicious code in dependencies.
