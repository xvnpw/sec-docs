# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Jazzy, is a documentation generator for Swift and Objective-C.

- Business Priorities:
  - To provide a tool that automatically generates developer documentation from source code.
  - To improve developer productivity by reducing the manual effort required to create and maintain documentation.
  - To enhance code understanding and maintainability through clear and accessible documentation.
  - To potentially enable sharing of documentation with external users or customers.

- Business Goals:
  - To create comprehensive and well-formatted documentation for Swift and Objective-C projects.
  - To ensure documentation is up-to-date with the latest code changes.
  - To make documentation easily accessible to developers and other stakeholders.
  - To support various documentation formats and output options.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of inaccurate or incomplete documentation if the tool fails to correctly parse source code.
  - Risk of exposing sensitive information if documentation generation process is not secure or if documentation is publicly accessible without proper authorization.
  - Risk of reduced developer productivity if the tool is unreliable, difficult to use, or generates poor quality documentation.
  - Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies used by Jazzy are compromised.
  - Risk of availability issues if the documentation generation process or hosting infrastructure is not resilient.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Access to the Jazzy GitHub repository is controlled by GitHub's authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implemented by: GitHub.
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the Jazzy project. Implemented by: Jazzy project maintainers (process).
  - security control: Usage of GitHub's issue tracking and pull request system for managing changes. Implemented by: GitHub.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Jazzy, as dependency management is inherent to software projects.
  - accepted risk: Potential for community contributions to introduce security issues, mitigated by code review.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying Ruby runtime environment.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in Jazzy's dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the Jazzy build process to detect potential security flaws in the code.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for source code parsing to prevent code injection or other vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Secure the process of publishing and distributing Jazzy as a gem to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - security control: If Jazzy is used in a CI/CD pipeline, ensure the pipeline itself is secure and access controlled.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to Jazzy itself as a command-line tool. Authentication might be relevant if Jazzy is integrated into a web-based documentation platform or CI/CD pipeline, but this is outside the scope of Jazzy itself.
  - Authorization:
    - Authorization is relevant for access to the Jazzy GitHub repository and potentially for access to any systems where Jazzy is deployed or used in a CI/CD pipeline. GitHub handles authorization for the repository. For deployment environments, authorization should be configured based on the specific context.
  - Input Validation:
    - Robust input validation is crucial for Jazzy to prevent vulnerabilities when parsing Swift and Objective-C source code. Jazzy must validate input file paths, command-line arguments, and the content of source code files to prevent malicious code injection or other attacks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography is not a primary security requirement for Jazzy itself. However, if Jazzy is used to handle or process sensitive data during documentation generation (e.g., API keys, secrets in code comments), then appropriate cryptographic measures might be needed in the projects that use Jazzy, but not within Jazzy itself. Secure communication (HTTPS) should be used if documentation is hosted on a web server.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software development lifecycle.
  - Documentation generation and maintenance.
  - Developer productivity and efficiency.
  - Code understanding and maintainability.
  - Potential external sharing of documentation.

- Data to Protect:
  - Source code (indirectly, as input to Jazzy). Sensitivity depends on the project being documented. Could range from public open-source code to proprietary and confidential code.
  - Generated documentation. Sensitivity depends on the content of the source code and the intended audience for the documentation. Could contain API keys, internal architecture details, or other sensitive information if not carefully reviewed.
  - Jazzy codebase itself. Integrity and availability of the Jazzy tool are important for its users.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code: Low to High, depending on the project.
  - Generated documentation: Low to Medium, depending on the project and review process.
  - Jazzy codebase: Medium, as it's a development tool used by many.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Where will the generated documentation be hosted? Publicly accessible or internally?
  - What is the intended audience for the documentation? Internal developers, external users, or both?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements related to the documentation or the projects using Jazzy?
  - What is the process for reviewing and approving generated documentation before it is published?
  - Are there any specific security concerns related to the source code being documented?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary goal is to improve developer productivity and code understanding through automated documentation generation.
    - Documentation is intended to be accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible.
    - The organization values developer experience and code quality.

  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Security is important but not the absolute highest priority compared to functionality and ease of use for a developer tool.
    - Basic security controls are in place, such as code review and dependency management.
    - There is a willingness to implement recommended security controls to improve the security posture of Jazzy and its usage.

  - DESIGN:
    - Jazzy is primarily used as a command-line tool by developers on their local machines or in CI/CD pipelines.
    - The deployment scenario described is focused on developer's local machine usage.
    - The build process is automated using GitHub Actions and publishes to RubyGems.org.
