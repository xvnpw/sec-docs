## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Documentation](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_documentation.md)

*   **Critical Node: Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Data**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Overly Broad Documentation Scope:** Jazzy might be configured to document a wider range of code than intended, including internal APIs, configuration details, or code sections containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, internal URLs).
        *   **Inclusion of Sensitive Comments:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information directly in code comments that are then processed and exposed in the generated documentation. This could include notes about security vulnerabilities, internal system architecture, or temporary credentials used for testing.
        *   **Accidental Documentation of Test/Debug Code:**  If test code or debugging code containing sensitive information is not properly excluded from Jazzy's documentation scope, it could be unintentionally published.
        *   **Lack of Review Process for Documentation Content:**  If there is no review process for the generated documentation before it is published, sensitive information might slip through unnoticed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jazzy Toolchain/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jazzy_toolchaindependencies.md)

*   **Critical Node: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Critical Node: Outdated Jazzy Dependencies**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Ruby Gems:** Jazzy relies on various Ruby gems. If these gems have known security vulnerabilities (publicly disclosed in vulnerability databases like CVE), and the application is using outdated versions of Jazzy and its dependencies, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
            *   **Exploitation of Publicly Available Exploits:** For many known vulnerabilities in popular gems, exploit code is often publicly available. Attackers can easily find and use these exploits to target systems running vulnerable versions of Jazzy's dependencies.
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Many dependency vulnerabilities, especially in server-side languages like Ruby, can lead to Remote Code Execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system where Jazzy is run, potentially compromising the application's build environment or even production infrastructure if Jazzy is used in deployment pipelines.
            *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, vulnerabilities in dependencies might allow attackers to escalate their privileges on the system, gaining administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage of Jazzy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_of_jazzy.md)

*   **Critical Node: Insecure Hosting of Generated Documentation**
    *   **Critical Node: Publicly Accessible Sensitive Documentation**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The generated documentation, even if containing sensitive information, might be hosted on a public web server without any authentication or authorization mechanisms. This allows anyone on the internet to access it.
            *   **Default Server Configurations:**  Using default or insecure web server configurations for hosting documentation can expose vulnerabilities. This includes outdated server software, missing security headers, enabled directory listing, or weak access controls.
            *   **Exposure of Internal Network Documentation:** If documentation intended for internal use only is accidentally hosted on a publicly accessible server, it can reveal internal network details, API endpoints, and system architecture to external attackers, aiding in reconnaissance for further attacks.
            *   **Search Engine Indexing:** Publicly hosted documentation might be indexed by search engines, making sensitive information even more easily discoverable by attackers.
            *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if using HTTP):** If the documentation is served over unencrypted HTTP, attackers on the network path can intercept the traffic and potentially steal sensitive information being transmitted. While less directly related to Jazzy, it's a risk of insecure hosting.
