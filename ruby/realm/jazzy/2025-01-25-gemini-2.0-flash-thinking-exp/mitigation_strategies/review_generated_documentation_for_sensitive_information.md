**1. Establish Review Process:**

*   **Description:** Implement a mandatory review step for generated documentation before publication.
*   **Analysis:** This is the foundational step and crucial for the strategy's success.  A mandatory review process introduces a human element into what is typically an automated documentation pipeline. This step is highly effective in principle as it creates a gatekeeper function to prevent sensitive information from being released.
*   **Effectiveness:** High.  Human review is excellent at identifying context-dependent sensitive information that automated tools might miss.
*   **Feasibility:** Medium. Requires integration into the development workflow.  Needs clear ownership and defined responsibilities for reviewers.  Can potentially introduce delays in documentation publication if not managed efficiently.
*   **Challenges:**  Resistance from development teams if perceived as adding overhead.  Defining clear triggers for the review process (e.g., before each release, documentation update).  Ensuring consistent application of the review process.
*   **Recommendations:** Integrate the review process into the existing release or documentation update workflow.  Clearly define roles and responsibilities for reviewers.  Use automation to trigger review notifications.  Consider using a documentation staging environment for review before public release.
*   **Jazzy Specifics:**  Jazzy generates documentation automatically. This step requires interrupting the automated pipeline and inserting a manual review stage *after* Jazzy generation but *before* publication.

**2. Define Review Checklist:**

*   **Description:** Create a checklist for reviewers to specifically look for sensitive information.
*   **Analysis:** A checklist provides structure and consistency to the review process. It ensures that reviewers are looking for specific types of sensitive information and reduces the chance of overlooking critical items.  The provided checklist items are relevant and comprehensive for typical software documentation.
*   **Effectiveness:** High.  Significantly increases the likelihood of identifying sensitive information by providing a structured approach.
*   **Feasibility:** High.  Creating and maintaining a checklist is relatively straightforward.  Can be easily updated as new types of sensitive information are identified.
*   **Challenges:**  Checklist needs to be regularly reviewed and updated to remain relevant.  Overly long or complex checklists can become cumbersome and less effective.  Reviewers need to understand the *context* of the checklist items, not just blindly follow it.
*   **Recommendations:**  Start with a concise and focused checklist.  Regularly review and update the checklist based on experience and evolving threats.  Provide examples and context for each checklist item during reviewer training.  Make the checklist easily accessible to reviewers (e.g., as a digital document or integrated into a review tool).
*   **Jazzy Specifics:** The checklist is technology-agnostic and directly applicable to reviewing documentation generated by Jazzy.  Reviewers need to understand the typical output structure of Jazzy documentation to effectively use the checklist.

**3. Train Reviewers:**

*   **Description:** Train developers or designated reviewers on identifying sensitive information and the importance of redaction.
*   **Analysis:** Training is essential for the success of the review process.  Reviewers need to understand what constitutes sensitive information in the context of documentation and the potential consequences of its disclosure.  Training should also cover redaction techniques and the importance of consistent application of the review process.
*   **Effectiveness:** High.  Well-trained reviewers are significantly more effective at identifying sensitive information than untrained individuals.
*   **Feasibility:** Medium. Requires time and resources to develop and deliver training.  Ongoing training or refresher sessions may be needed, especially for new team members or as threats evolve.
*   **Challenges:**  Ensuring consistent training across all reviewers.  Keeping training materials up-to-date.  Measuring the effectiveness of the training.  Motivating reviewers to take the training seriously and apply it diligently.
*   **Recommendations:**  Develop targeted training materials specifically for documentation review.  Use real-world examples and case studies in training.  Incorporate hands-on exercises or simulations.  Provide ongoing training and updates.  Track reviewer training completion and effectiveness.
*   **Jazzy Specifics:** Training should include examples of sensitive information that might inadvertently appear in Jazzy-generated documentation, such as internal class names, function signatures revealing implementation details, or comments containing secrets.

**4. Redact Sensitive Information:**

*   **Description:** If sensitive information is found, redact it from the documentation.  This includes editing source code comments, using Jazzy configuration, or post-processing.
*   **Analysis:** Redaction is the core action taken when sensitive information is identified.  The described methods (source code comments, Jazzy config, post-processing) offer flexibility in how redaction can be achieved.  Choosing the appropriate method depends on the type of sensitive information and the desired level of control.
*   **Effectiveness:** High.  Directly removes sensitive information from the published documentation.
*   **Feasibility:** Medium.  Requires understanding of Jazzy configuration and potentially post-processing tools.  Editing source code comments might require careful consideration to avoid impacting code clarity.  Post-processing adds complexity to the documentation pipeline.
*   **Challenges:**  Ensuring redaction is complete and consistent.  Avoiding accidental re-introduction of sensitive information in future documentation updates.  Maintaining a balance between security and documentation completeness/usefulness.  Post-processing can be error-prone and require careful testing.
*   **Recommendations:**  Prioritize redaction at the source (source code comments or Jazzy configuration) whenever possible for maintainability.  Use Jazzy configuration options (e.g., `--exclude`) to prevent generation of sensitive sections.  If post-processing is necessary, automate it as much as possible and thoroughly test the process.  Document the redaction methods used.
*   **Jazzy Specifics:**  Leverage Jazzy's configuration options to control what is included in the documentation.  Explore Jazzy plugins or custom scripts for more advanced post-processing if needed.  Consider using Jazzy's comment directives to control documentation generation for specific code sections.

**5. Version Control Review:**

*   **Description:** Ensure changes made during the review process (redactions, comment modifications) are properly tracked in version control.
*   **Analysis:** Version control is crucial for maintaining an audit trail of changes, facilitating collaboration, and enabling rollback if necessary.  Tracking redaction changes in version control ensures accountability and allows for review of the redaction process itself.
*   **Effectiveness:** Medium.  Indirectly contributes to security by improving accountability and maintainability of the redaction process.  Essential for long-term management of documentation security.
*   **Feasibility:** High.  Standard practice in software development to use version control.  Requires minimal additional effort if version control is already in place.
*   **Challenges:**  Ensuring that *all* redaction changes are committed to version control.  Properly documenting the *reason* for redaction in commit messages.  Training reviewers to use version control effectively for documentation changes.
*   **Recommendations:**  Integrate documentation changes into the standard version control workflow.  Encourage reviewers to create separate commits for documentation redaction changes with clear commit messages.  Use code review practices for documentation changes as well.
*   **Jazzy Specifics:**  Version control should track changes to source code comments, Jazzy configuration files, and any post-processing scripts used for redaction.  This ensures that the entire documentation generation and redaction process is auditable.
