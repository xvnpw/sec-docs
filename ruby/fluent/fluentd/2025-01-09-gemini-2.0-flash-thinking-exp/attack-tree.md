## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Send Crafted Logs via Insecure Input Source](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_send_crafted_logs_via_insecure_input_source.md)

* **Exploit lack of authentication/authorization on input sources (e.g., unsecured TCP/UDP ports):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Fluentd, by default or through misconfiguration, might be configured to listen for log data on network ports (like TCP or UDP) without requiring any form of authentication or authorization.
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker can send arbitrary log data to these open ports.
    * **Impact:** This allows the attacker to inject malicious or misleading log entries into the system. These injected logs could be crafted to trigger vulnerabilities in the application that consumes the logs, hide malicious activity, or pollute analytics data.

* **Inject malicious data into log streams from compromised application components:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If other parts of the application are compromised, the attacker can leverage that access to inject malicious log entries into the log streams that Fluentd is collecting.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses their access to a compromised component to generate and send crafted log messages that Fluentd will process and forward.
    * **Impact:**  This allows the attacker to inject logs that appear to originate from legitimate sources within the application, making detection more difficult. The injected logs can have the same malicious intent as described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary Code via Fluentd](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_execute_arbitrary_code_via_fluentd.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities (Code Injection):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Fluentd relies heavily on plugins for input, filtering, and output. These plugins are often developed by third parties and may contain security vulnerabilities, such as command injection or SQL injection flaws.
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies and exploits a known vulnerability in a loaded Fluentd plugin. This could involve sending specially crafted log data or manipulating plugin configurations.
    * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Fluentd, leading to full system compromise.

    * *Leverage known vulnerabilities in plugins allowing execution of arbitrary code (e.g., command injection, SQL injection in output plugins):*
        * **Attack Vector:** Specific plugins might have vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in system commands or database queries.
        * **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts malicious log data or configuration parameters that, when processed by the vulnerable plugin, result in the execution of arbitrary commands or SQL queries.
        * **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to run commands on the server (command injection) or manipulate databases (SQL injection), potentially gaining further access or control.

    * *Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in plugins handling serialized data:*
        * **Attack Vector:** Some plugins might handle serialized data (e.g., JSON, YAML, Ruby's Marshal format). If this deserialization is not done securely, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, leads to code execution.
        * **Attacker Action:** The attacker sends malicious serialized data to Fluentd, which is then processed by the vulnerable plugin.
        * **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code when the malicious data is deserialized.

* **Critical Node: Manipulate Fluentd Configuration:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to Fluentd's configuration files, they can modify the configuration to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker gains read/write access to the `fluent.conf` file or other configuration files used by Fluentd.
    * **Impact:** This grants the attacker significant control over Fluentd's behavior, allowing them to configure malicious input or output plugins.

    * *Critical Node: Gain unauthorized access to Fluentd configuration files:*
        * **Attack Vector:**  Attackers can exploit operating system vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or use stolen or default credentials to gain access to the server's file system where Fluentd's configuration files are stored.
        * **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses various techniques to gain access to the server's file system.
        * **Impact:**  Once access is gained, the attacker can read and modify the Fluentd configuration.

        * *Exploit OS-level vulnerabilities or misconfigurations:*
            * **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities in the operating system running Fluentd or insecure OS configurations (e.g., weak file permissions, unpatched vulnerabilities) can be exploited.
            * **Attacker Action:** The attacker leverages known OS vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access to the file system.
            * **Impact:** Allows the attacker to read and modify system files, including Fluentd's configuration.

        * *Leverage weak credentials or default passwords:*
            * **Attack Vector:** If the server running Fluentd uses weak or default passwords for user accounts, attackers can easily gain access.
            * **Attacker Action:** The attacker attempts to log in using common default credentials or brute-forces weak passwords.
            * **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker access to the server and its file system.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exfiltrate Sensitive Information via Fluentd](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exfiltrate_sensitive_information_via_fluentd.md)

* **Critical Node: Manipulate Output Plugins:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can modify Fluentd's configuration, they can reconfigure output plugins to send log data to attacker-controlled destinations.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker gains write access to Fluentd's configuration files and modifies the settings of output plugins.
    * **Impact:** This allows the attacker to exfiltrate all the log data that Fluentd is collecting, potentially including sensitive information like API keys, passwords, personal data, etc.

    * *Reconfigure output plugins (via configuration manipulation) to send logs to attacker-controlled destinations:*
        * **Attack Vector:** By modifying the configuration, the attacker can change the destination of log output (e.g., changing the target server for an `out_forward` plugin or the storage bucket for an `out_s3` plugin).
        * **Attacker Action:** The attacker alters the configuration file to point the output plugin to a server or storage location under their control.
        * **Impact:** All subsequent logs processed by Fluentd will be sent to the attacker's destination, allowing them to collect sensitive information.
