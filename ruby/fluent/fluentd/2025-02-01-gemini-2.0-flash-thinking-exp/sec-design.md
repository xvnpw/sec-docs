# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Fluentd, aims to provide a unified logging layer, enabling businesses to collect, process, and forward log data from various sources to diverse destinations.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Centralized Logging: Aggregate logs from disparate systems into a single platform for easier analysis and management.
  - Real-time Data Processing: Enable immediate processing and forwarding of log data for timely insights and incident response.
  - Data Integration: Facilitate seamless integration with various data storage, analytics, and monitoring tools.
  - Scalability and Reliability: Ensure the logging system can handle increasing data volumes and remain operational under stress.
  - Open Source and Community Driven: Leverage community contributions and open standards for flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

- Business Risks:
  - Data Loss: Failure to reliably collect and forward logs, leading to loss of critical operational data.
  - Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive log data, resulting in confidentiality violations and compliance issues.
  - System Unavailability: Downtime of the logging system, hindering monitoring and incident response capabilities.
  - Performance Bottleneck: Inefficient log processing impacting overall system performance and data delivery latency.
  - Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration leading to incorrect data routing, filtering, or loss of logs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Access control to Fluentd configuration files (typically file system permissions). Implemented via operating system level access controls.
  - security control: Plugin-based architecture allows for community contributions, but also requires careful review of plugin security. Implemented via community review process and user discretion.
  - security control: Support for TLS/SSL for secure communication channels. Implemented in input and output plugins that support network communication.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user-provided plugins introduces potential security vulnerabilities if plugins are not thoroughly vetted.
  - accepted risk: Default configurations might not be hardened and require manual security adjustments.
  - accepted risk: Security of destination systems is outside the scope of Fluentd itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of Fluentd core and plugins (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
  - security control: Enforce least privilege principles for Fluentd process execution and access to resources.
  - security control: Implement centralized configuration management and version control for Fluentd configurations.
  - security control: Establish a security incident response plan specifically for the logging infrastructure.
  - security control: Regularly audit Fluentd configurations and logs for security misconfigurations and anomalies.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for accessing Fluentd management interfaces (if any) and configuration.
    - Requirement: Authentication for plugins that require external service access.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing Fluentd configurations and accessing logs.
    - Requirement: Authorization policies to control plugin execution and resource access.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Input validation for data received from various sources to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - Requirement: Sanitization of log data before forwarding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities in downstream systems.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Encryption of sensitive log data in transit using TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: Consider encryption of sensitive log data at rest, depending on storage destination capabilities and sensitivity of data.
    - Requirement: Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys and certificates.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Operational Monitoring: Fluentd enables real-time monitoring of application and system behavior, crucial for maintaining service availability and performance.
  - Security Monitoring and Incident Response: Logs collected by Fluentd are essential for security monitoring, threat detection, and incident investigation.
  - Compliance and Auditing: Log data is often required for compliance with regulatory requirements and for audit trails.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Log data can contain sensitive information depending on the systems being monitored. This may include:
    - Application logs: Potentially contain user data, transaction details, error messages with sensitive information.
    - System logs: May contain system configurations, user activity, security events.
    - Database logs: Could include query details, data access patterns.
  - Sensitivity level: Moderate to High, depending on the specific data logged and the organization's data classification policies. Data confidentiality and integrity are important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific regulatory compliance requirements for log data in the target environment?
  - What is the expected volume of log data Fluentd will need to handle?
  - What are the specific data retention requirements for logs?
  - Are there any specific security policies or standards that Fluentd deployment must adhere to?
  - What are the performance requirements for log delivery latency?

- Assumptions:
  - Fluentd will be deployed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises Kubernetes cluster.
  - Data storage destination supports appropriate security controls (access control, encryption at rest).
  - Security team and operations team have the necessary expertise to manage and monitor Fluentd.
  - Organization has existing security policies and incident response procedures that will be extended to cover the logging infrastructure.
  - Input sources are trusted to some extent, but input validation is still necessary to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
