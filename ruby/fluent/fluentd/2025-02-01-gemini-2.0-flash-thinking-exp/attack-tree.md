## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fluentd Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fluentd_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Fluentd are a primary high-risk attack vector.  These are often easier to exploit than code vulnerabilities and can have significant impact.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Exploit Fluentd Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** The overarching category of configuration-related attacks.
    *   **Misconfiguration leading to Information Disclosure [CRITICAL]:**  Exposing sensitive information through misconfiguration.
    *   **Improperly secured Fluentd UI/API (if enabled) [CRITICAL]:**  Direct access point if not secured.
    *   **Verbose logging configuration exposing sensitive data [CRITICAL]:**  Unintentional logging of sensitive information.
    *   **Misconfiguration leading to Insecure Plugin Usage [CRITICAL]:**  Using plugins in an insecure manner due to misconfiguration.
    *   **Using vulnerable or outdated plugins [CRITICAL]:**  Directly using plugins with known security flaws.

*   **High-Risk Paths originating from this node:**
    *   **Access sensitive logs/metrics via unauthorized access (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  If Fluentd's UI or API is enabled and not properly secured (e.g., default credentials, no authentication, exposed to public networks), attackers can gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive logs and metrics. This can include application secrets, user data, and internal system details, potentially leading to credential theft and further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Disable Fluentd UI/API if not strictly necessary.
            *   If UI/API is required, enforce strong authentication (not default credentials).
            *   Implement robust access control and authorization.
            *   Restrict access to trusted networks only.
            *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.

    *   **Logs contain credentials, API keys, PII, etc. (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Overly verbose logging configurations can inadvertently include sensitive data like passwords, API keys, personal information (PII), or internal system details in logs that Fluentd processes and potentially stores or forwards.
        *   **Impact:** High risk of sensitive data exposure, leading to compliance violations, reputational damage, and potential identity theft or further system compromise if credentials are leaked.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Minimize logging verbosity. Log only necessary information.
            *   Implement data masking or redaction techniques in the application before logging or within Fluentd filters to remove sensitive data from logs.
            *   Regularly review logging configurations to ensure they are not overly verbose and do not log sensitive information.

    *   **Exploit known vulnerabilities in plugins (RCE, SSRF, etc.) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Using outdated or vulnerable Fluentd plugins exposes the system to known vulnerabilities within those plugins. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities, which can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE) to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and other security flaws.
        *   **Impact:**  Potentially catastrophic, including full system compromise via RCE, access to internal networks via SSRF, data breaches, and service disruption.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all Fluentd plugins in use.
            *   Regularly check for and apply updates to Fluentd and all its plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   Subscribe to security advisories for Fluentd and its plugins to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
            *   Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated or vulnerable plugins.
            *   Implement a process for quickly patching or removing vulnerable plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection Attacks via Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection_attacks_via_application__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Log injection attacks are a high-risk path because they leverage vulnerabilities in the application itself to compromise the logging infrastructure (Fluentd) and potentially the entire system.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks via Application [CRITICAL]:** The broad category of attacks originating from malicious logs injected by the application.
    *   **Inject Malicious Payloads into Application Logs [CRITICAL]:** The action of injecting malicious content into application logs.
    *   **Code Injection via Logged Data (High-Risk Path):** Specifically injecting code through logs.

*   **High-Risk Paths originating from this node:**
    *   **Code Injection via Logged Data (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application logs user-controlled data without proper sanitization, and Fluentd's parsers, filters, or output plugins are vulnerable to code injection, attackers can inject malicious code within the logged data. When Fluentd processes these logs, the injected code can be executed, leading to compromise of the Fluentd server and potentially the application infrastructure.
        *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Fluentd server, potentially leading to full system compromise. Attackers can gain control of the logging infrastructure, manipulate logs, pivot to other systems, and exfiltrate data.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Robust Input Sanitization in Application:**  Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation in the application *before* logging any user-controlled data. This is the most critical mitigation step.
            *   **Secure Log Processing Pipeline:** Harden Fluentd's processing pipeline. Use secure parsers and filters. Avoid using logged data directly in commands or code execution within Fluentd plugins.
            *   **Output Sanitization:** If possible, implement output sanitization in Fluentd to further mitigate the risk of code injection, although input sanitization in the application is the primary defense.
            *   **Security Awareness for Developers:** Train developers on secure logging practices and the risks of log injection vulnerabilities.
