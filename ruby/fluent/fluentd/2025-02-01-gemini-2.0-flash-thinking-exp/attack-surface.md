# Attack Surface Analysis for fluent/fluentd

## Attack Surface: [Input Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within input plugins that process data from various sources. These can include buffer overflows, injection flaws, or deserialization issues.
**Fluentd Contribution:** Fluentd's plugin-based architecture relies on numerous input plugins, increasing the likelihood of encountering vulnerabilities in third-party or less-maintained plugins.
**Example:** A vulnerable `in_http` plugin with a buffer overflow. An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long header, causing a buffer overflow in the plugin, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Fluentd server.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Plugin Selection:**  Use only well-maintained and reputable input plugins. Prefer plugins from the official Fluentd ecosystem or those with strong community support and security records.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep all Fluentd plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Fluentd and its plugins for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation and sanitization within the application sending data to Fluentd, even if plugins are expected to handle it.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection in Filter Plugins](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_in_filter_plugins.md)

**Description:** Filter plugins that allow users to define custom logic (e.g., using embedded scripting languages) can be vulnerable to code injection if not properly sandboxed.
**Fluentd Contribution:** Fluentd's flexibility allows for custom filter logic, which, if implemented insecurely, can introduce code injection vulnerabilities.
**Example:** A filter plugin using Ruby's `eval()` function to process log data based on user-provided configuration. An attacker can manipulate the configuration to inject malicious Ruby code that gets executed by Fluentd.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Exfiltration, Privilege Escalation.
**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic code execution features in filter plugins. Prefer declarative configuration or well-tested, pre-built filter plugins.
*   **Input Sanitization for Dynamic Logic:** If dynamic logic is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate any user-provided input that influences the execution of this logic.
*   **Plugin Review:** Carefully review the code of filter plugins that use dynamic logic, especially if they are custom-built or from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Credentials in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_credentials_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys) directly in Fluentd configuration files, making them vulnerable to exposure if the configuration is compromised.
**Fluentd Contribution:** Fluentd configuration often requires credentials for input and output plugins. Storing these directly in configuration files is a common misconfiguration within Fluentd deployments.
**Example:** An `out_s3` plugin configuration that includes the AWS access key and secret key directly in the `fluent.conf` file. If an attacker gains access to this file, they can obtain the AWS credentials.
**Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Output Destinations, Data Breaches, Cloud Account Compromise.
**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secrets Management:** Use dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and manage credentials securely.
*   **Environment Variables:**  Utilize environment variables to pass credentials to Fluentd instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
*   **Configuration File Protection:** Restrict access to Fluentd configuration files to authorized personnel and processes only. Use appropriate file system permissions.
