## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Logs](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_logs.md)

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in input plugins (HTTP, TCP, Syslog, etc.) to inject arbitrary data or code through parsing bugs or buffer overflows.
* Crafting log messages with special characters or escape sequences that are not properly handled by Fluentd or downstream systems, leading to command injection or other unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Plugin Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_plugin_vulnerability.md)

Successful exploitation can lead to immediate code execution or the injection of malicious data into the logging pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Log Data to Influence Downstream Processes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_log_data_to_influence_downstream_processes.md)

* Injecting false or misleading information into logs to trigger errors, alerts, or incorrect actions in applications or security systems that consume these logs.
* Injecting malicious payloads disguised as legitimate log data, which are then processed and potentially executed by downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Filtering Logic](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_filtering_logic.md)

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Fluentd configuration mechanism to inject malicious filter rules that drop legitimate logs, allow malicious logs to pass through, or modify log data in transit.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in specific filter plugins to bypass filtering logic or cause incorrect data transformations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Filter)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__filter_.md)

Compromising the configuration grants significant control over how logs are processed and where they are sent, enabling various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filter Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filter_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Allows attackers to bypass security measures and manipulate log data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect Logs to Malicious Destinations](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_logs_to_malicious_destinations.md)

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Fluentd configuration to change the output destinations to attacker-controlled servers, enabling data exfiltration.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in output plugins to redirect logs or gain unauthorized access to the configured output destinations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Output)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__output_.md)

Compromising the configuration grants significant control over how logs are processed and where they are sent, enabling various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Can lead to code execution on output systems or unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in those systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Information via Output](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_information_via_output.md)

* Exploiting insecure configurations in output plugins that inadvertently expose sensitive data (e.g., credentials, API keys) in the logs being sent to less secure destinations.
* Exploiting bugs in output plugins that lead to unintended data exposure through the output stream.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fluentd Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fluentd_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

Provides the attacker with the keys to the kingdom, allowing them to manipulate the entire logging pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Fluentd Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_fluentd_configuration.md)

* Exploiting insecure file system permissions to directly access and modify the Fluentd configuration file.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in remote configuration management interfaces (if enabled) to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Fluentd Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/modify_fluentd_configuration.md)

* Injecting malicious input, filter, or output configurations after gaining access to the configuration.
* Disabling security features within the Fluentd configuration to weaken the logging pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Offers a direct route to code execution on the Fluentd server by exploiting known vulnerabilities in underlying libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deployment Practices Specific to Fluentd](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deployment_practices_specific_to_fluentd.md)

Creates fundamental weaknesses that can be easily exploited, such as running with excessive privileges or exposing management interfaces without proper security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Run Fluentd with Excessive Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/run_fluentd_with_excessive_privileges.md)

Deploying Fluentd with higher privileges than necessary (e.g., running as root), which, if compromised, grants the attacker elevated privileges on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Fluentd Management Interfaces Insecurely](./attack_tree_paths/expose_fluentd_management_interfaces_insecurely.md)

* Leaving Fluentd management API endpoints unprotected, allowing unauthorized access to control and configure the service.
* Using default or weak credentials for management interfaces, allowing easy access for attackers.
