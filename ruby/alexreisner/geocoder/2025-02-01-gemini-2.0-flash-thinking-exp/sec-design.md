# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly and versatile Python library for geocoding and reverse geocoding.
  - Simplify the integration of location-based services into Python applications.
  - Support multiple geocoding providers to offer flexibility and redundancy.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of inaccurate geocoding results leading to errors in applications relying on location data.
  - Risk of dependency on external geocoding services, which may introduce availability, performance, or cost variability.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities within the library that could be exploited by applications using it.
  - Risk of improper handling of location data, potentially leading to privacy violations or compliance issues depending on the application context.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The library is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Dependency Management - Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, facilitating dependency tracking and management. (Implemented: `requirements.txt`)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Geocoding Services - The library depends on external geocoding services for its core functionality, inheriting their security and availability risks.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Input Validation - Implement robust input validation to sanitize address inputs and prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
  - security control: Rate Limiting/Usage Quotas - Consider implementing rate limiting or usage quotas within applications using this library to prevent abuse of geocoding services and potential denial-of-service scenarios.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, but applications using the library will need to handle authentication for accessing geocoding services if required by the provider.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself, but applications using the library will need to manage authorization for accessing geocoding services based on the provider's requirements and user permissions.
  - Input Validation: Essential for all input parameters, especially address strings, to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity. Validation should be performed on both the client and server side (if applicable in the context of the application using the library).
  - Cryptography: May be relevant if applications using this library handle sensitive location data. Encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest should be considered for sensitive location information depending on the application's data protection requirements.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to a Version Control System (e.g., Git/GitHub).
  - The CI/CD system is triggered by code changes (e.g., push to repository).
  - Build Job: Compiles the code and prepares build artifacts.
  - Test Job: Executes automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure code quality and functionality.
  - Security Scan Job: Performs security scans, including:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency scanning to check for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - Package Job: Packages the build artifacts into distributable formats (e.g., wheel, sdist for Python).
  - Publish Job: Publishes the packaged artifacts to an Artifact Repository (e.g., PyPI for public release, or a private repository for internal use).
- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Build Process - Using a CI/CD system ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing the risk of manual errors and unauthorized modifications.
  - security control: Version Control - Code changes are tracked and managed using version control, providing auditability and rollback capabilities.
  - security control: Automated Testing - Automated tests help ensure code quality and reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - SAST tools analyze the source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Regularly scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities and updating them helps mitigate risks associated with vulnerable third-party libraries.
  - security control: Secure CI/CD Pipeline - Securing the CI/CD pipeline itself, including access controls, secrets management, and pipeline configuration, is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - security control: Code Signing (optional) - Signing the published packages can provide assurance of package integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Applications relying on accurate location data for core functionalities such as mapping, navigation, location-based services, address verification, and geographic analysis.
  - Business processes that depend on the availability and reliability of geocoding services integrated through the library.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Address Data: Input addresses provided to the library may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) depending on the context. Sensitivity varies based on application and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  - Location Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude): Geocoding results (coordinates) can also be considered sensitive, especially when linked to individuals or specific locations. Sensitivity depends on the application and how this data is used and stored.
  - API Keys: API keys for accessing geocoding services are sensitive credentials that must be protected to prevent unauthorized access and usage of these services.
