# Threat Model Analysis for alexreisner/geocoder

## Threat: [API Key Exposure](./threats/api_key_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could discover exposed API keys for geocoding providers that are used by the `geocoder` gem. This could happen if keys are hardcoded in the application code, committed to version control, or exposed in client-side code. Once exposed, attackers can use these keys to make unauthorized requests to the geocoding provider's API.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized usage of API keys can lead to significant financial costs due to quota overages, service disruption if the provider revokes the key due to abuse, and potentially enable further malicious activities if the API access grants broader permissions beyond geocoding.

**Geocoder Component Affected:** Application configuration (where API keys are stored and used by the `Geocoder` gem to access external providers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Securely store API keys:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to store API keys outside of the application codebase.
*   **Restrict API key usage:** If the geocoding provider allows it, restrict API key usage to specific domains, IP addresses, or application origins to limit potential abuse from unauthorized sources.
*   **Regularly rotate API keys:** Implement a process for periodically rotating API keys to minimize the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
*   **Avoid committing keys to version control:** Never hardcode API keys directly in the application code or configuration files that are committed to version control systems.
*   **Monitor API key usage:** Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual API key usage patterns that might indicate unauthorized access or abuse.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** The `geocoder` gem itself, or its dependencies (gems it relies upon), might contain security vulnerabilities. If a high or critical severity vulnerability is discovered and exploited by an attacker, it could allow them to compromise the application using the `geocoder` gem. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the gem's code, or in the libraries it depends on for network communication, data parsing, or other functionalities.

**Impact:**  The impact of exploiting a dependency vulnerability can be severe, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server, data breaches, denial of service, or complete application takeover, depending on the nature and location of the vulnerability.

**Geocoder Component Affected:** `Geocoder` gem core code and its dependencies (libraries used by the gem, listed in `Gemfile` or `gemspec`).

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep dependencies updated:** Regularly update the `geocoder` gem and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Security patches are often released in newer versions to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Use dependency scanning tools:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (like `bundler audit`, `snyk`, or GitHub Dependabot) into the development and deployment pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   **Monitor security advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (like CVE, NVD, RubySec) to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting the `geocoder` gem and its ecosystem.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the application and its dependencies, including the `geocoder` gem, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Isolate application components:** Employ security best practices like containerization and least privilege principles to limit the impact of a potential vulnerability exploitation by isolating application components and restricting access permissions.
