# Attack Surface Analysis for alexreisner/geocoder

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Geocoding Service Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_geocoding_service_communication.md)

* **Description:** If the communication between the `geocoder` library and external geocoding services is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS), attackers can intercept and potentially modify the data exchanged.
* **How `geocoder` Contributes:** `geocoder` initiates these external requests to fetch geocoding data. If it doesn't enforce secure communication, it exposes the application to MitM attacks.
* **Example:** An attacker intercepts a request for geocoding data made by `geocoder` and replaces the legitimate coordinates with malicious ones, leading the application to make incorrect decisions based on false location information.
* **Impact:**  Logical errors in the application, security vulnerabilities based on incorrect location data, potential redirection of users based on manipulated location.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure the `geocoder` library is configured to use HTTPS for all communication with geocoding services.
    * Verify SSL/TLS certificates of the geocoding service endpoints.
    * Consider using a geocoding service that strictly enforces HTTPS.

## Attack Surface: [Geocoding Service API Key Exposure (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/geocoding_service_api_key_exposure__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** Some geocoding services require API keys for authentication. If these keys are not handled securely within the application's configuration when used with `geocoder`, they can be exposed.
* **How `geocoder` Contributes:** The application using `geocoder` needs to provide these API keys, and if `geocoder`'s configuration or the application's handling of these keys is insecure, it creates an exposure point.
* **Example:** API keys required by the geocoding service are hardcoded in the application's code where `geocoder` is initialized or stored in easily accessible configuration files used by `geocoder`. An attacker gaining access to the codebase or configuration can steal the API key.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized use of the geocoding service, potentially leading to unexpected costs, quota exhaustion, or even manipulation of geocoding data if the service is compromised.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and ensure `geocoder` is configured to retrieve them from these secure sources.
    * Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application's source code or configuration files used directly by `geocoder`.
    * Implement proper access controls to limit who can access the API keys.
    * Regularly rotate API keys.
