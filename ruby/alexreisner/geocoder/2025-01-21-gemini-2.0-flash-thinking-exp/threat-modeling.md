# Threat Model Analysis for alexreisner/geocoder

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `geocoder` library relies on other Python packages (dependencies). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the `geocoder` library. This could involve leveraging vulnerabilities in libraries used for making HTTP requests, parsing data, or other functionalities.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial-of-service to remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the application server or access sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** The dependencies of the `geocoder` library as listed in its `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `geocoder` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `pip check`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for monitoring security advisories related to the `geocoder` library and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Input Injection / Parameter Tampering](./threats/input_injection__parameter_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** While `geocoder` aims to abstract away the specifics of each geocoding service, vulnerabilities might exist in how it constructs and sends requests to these services. An attacker might try to craft malicious input that, when passed to `geocoder` functions (e.g., `geocode()`, `reverse()`), gets improperly sanitized or encoded and injected into the underlying API requests to the external service. This could involve manipulating parameters or adding unexpected characters.
*   **Impact:** This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior from the geocoding service, bypass intended restrictions, or in some cases, potentially expose sensitive information or allow for unintended actions on the geocoding service if the underlying API is vulnerable to such injection.
*   **Affected Component:** `geocoder`'s internal functions for constructing API requests for different providers (within provider-specific modules like `arcgis.py`, `google.py`, `osm.py`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate user-provided input rigorously before passing it to `geocoder` functions.
    *   Be aware of the specific parameters and expected input formats of the underlying geocoding services being used.
    *   Review the `geocoder` library's code for any potential injection points or areas where input is not properly handled before being sent to external services.
    *   Consider contributing to the `geocoder` project by reporting potential injection vulnerabilities if discovered.
