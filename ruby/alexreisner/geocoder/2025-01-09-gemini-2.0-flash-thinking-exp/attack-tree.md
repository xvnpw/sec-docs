## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Unvalidated Input leading to Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_unvalidated_input_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **PASS UNTRUSTED USER INPUT DIRECTLY TO GEOCODER (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided addresses or coordinates before passing them to the `geocoder` library.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - This is a common vulnerability in web applications.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but opens the door for severe attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it with the `geocoder` library. Use allow-lists and escape potentially harmful characters.

*   **Inject Code via Address String (Provider-Specific) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious address string containing code or commands that are unintentionally executed by the underlying geocoding provider or the `geocoder` library during response processing. This is highly dependent on the specific provider's parsing logic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires specific vulnerabilities in the geocoding provider and how the `geocoder` handles responses.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the application server or within the provider's infrastructure.
    *   **Mitigation:** Be aware of the parsing logic of the geocoding providers used. Avoid passing potentially harmful characters or sequences. Consider using providers with stricter input handling or sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: MITM leading to Malicious Location Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_mitm_leading_to_malicious_location_manipulation.md)

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Geocoding Provider Communication:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application (via the `geocoder` library) and the geocoding provider. This can occur on unsecured networks or through compromised network infrastructure.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic.
    *   **Impact:** High - Allows modification of geocoding data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication with geocoding providers. Implement certificate pinning if feasible.

*   **Inject Malicious Coordinates (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** After successfully performing a MITM attack, the attacker modifies the latitude and longitude values in the geocoding response.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on successful MITM)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Can lead to the application making incorrect location-based decisions, redirecting users to malicious locations, or bypassing geographical restrictions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement integrity checks on critical geocoding data. Validate the reasonableness of returned coordinates. Consider using signed responses if the provider supports it.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

*   **Vulnerabilities in HTTP Request Library (used by Geocoder) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The `geocoder` library relies on an HTTP request library (likely `requests` in Python). If this library has known vulnerabilities (e.g., request smuggling, SSRF), an attacker can exploit them through the `geocoder`'s functionality.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the library and the `geocoder`'s usage.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical - Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or other severe vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update the `geocoder` library and its HTTP request library dependency to the latest versions. Review security advisories for the used HTTP library.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Data Parsing Libraries (used by Geocoder) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The `geocoder` library uses libraries to parse responses from geocoding providers (e.g., JSON or XML parsing libraries). Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited if the `geocoder` doesn't handle them securely.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the parsing library and the `geocoder`'s usage.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to code execution, information disclosure, or denial-of-service.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update the `geocoder` library and its data parsing library dependencies. Be aware of known vulnerabilities in used parsing libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Insecure API Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_insecure_api_key_management.md)

*   **Insecure API Key Management (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** API keys used to authenticate with the geocoding provider are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the code, committed to version control). Attackers can find and exploit these exposed keys.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - This is a common misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Allows attackers to make requests to the geocoding service on behalf of the application, potentially leading to quota exhaustion, increased costs, or access to sensitive data if the provider allows it based on the key.
    *   **Mitigation:** Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables, secure secrets management systems, or secure configuration files to store API keys. Implement API key rotation and restrict key usage if the provider allows it.
