# Threat Model Analysis for alexreisner/geocoder

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Malicious Input](./threats/denial_of_service_through_malicious_input.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability within the `geocoder` library's code, specifically in how it processes input (e.g., addresses or coordinates), could be exploited by providing specially crafted or excessively large input. This malicious input could cause the library to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to application slowdowns or crashes. An attacker might attempt to trigger this by submitting unusual or malformed data through application features that utilize the `geocoder` library.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This can disrupt critical functionalities that rely on geocoding.

**Affected Component:** Input processing and validation within the `geocoder` library's functions (e.g., geocoding or reverse geocoding methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `geocoder` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to the `geocoder` library. This includes checking for excessively long strings, unusual characters, and unexpected data formats.
*   Implement resource limits and timeouts for geocoding operations to prevent runaway processes initiated by malicious input.
