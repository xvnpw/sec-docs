*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Geocoding Requests
    *   **Description:** If the `geocoder` library is not configured to enforce HTTPS for communication with the chosen geocoding service, an attacker could intercept communication between the application and the external service. The attacker can then read or modify the requests and responses. They might steal location data being sent or manipulate the geocoding results returned to the application, leading to incorrect behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of potentially sensitive location data, manipulation of geocoding results leading to incorrect application logic, potential for redirection or other malicious actions based on altered location data.
    *   **Affected Component:** The underlying HTTP request mechanism used by the `geocoder` library to communicate with external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `geocoder` library is configured to enforce HTTPS for all geocoding providers.
        *   Verify the SSL/TLS certificates of the geocoding services to prevent certificate pinning bypasses.
        *   Educate developers about the importance of secure communication and proper configuration of the `geocoder` library.

*   **Threat:** API Key Exposure and Abuse
    *   **Description:** Many geocoding services require API keys for authentication. If these keys are not handled securely, an attacker could gain access to them. This could happen through insecure configuration practices that affect how the `geocoder` library is initialized with the API key. Once exposed, an attacker can abuse the API key for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized use of the geocoding service leading to unexpected costs or quota exhaustion, potential for attackers to perform malicious geocoding operations under your account, denial-of-service against your own application's access to the geocoding service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The configuration mechanism used to provide API keys to the `geocoder` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application code or committing them to version control.
        *   Implement proper access controls to restrict who can access the API keys.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity and set up alerts for unusual patterns.
        *   Utilize API key restrictions provided by the geocoding service (e.g., IP address restrictions, referrer restrictions).

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `geocoder` Library Dependencies
    *   **Description:** The `geocoder` library relies on other third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (e.g., security flaws in the HTTP request library) could indirectly affect the security of the application using `geocoder`. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the `geocoder` library to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various security vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial-of-service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The third-party dependencies used by the `geocoder` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Depends on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can range from low to critical, including high and critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `geocoder` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the `geocoder` library and its dependencies.
