# Attack Surface Analysis for alexreisner/geocoder

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure/Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposurecompromise.md)

*Description:* Unauthorized access and use of the application's geocoding service API keys.
*How `geocoder` Contributes:* The library *requires* and *manages* API keys to function. It's the central point of interaction with external services that use these keys. Improper handling *within the context of using the library* is the direct risk.
*Example:* The application code, while using `geocoder`, reads the API key from a file with overly permissive permissions. An attacker on the same system can read the file and steal the key.
*Impact:* Financial loss, service disruption (denial of service), potential access to sensitive location data.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** / **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Use environment variables. Utilize secrets management systems. Implement `.gitignore` and pre-commit hooks. Rotate API keys regularly. Ensure the code interacting with `geocoder` securely handles the key.

## Attack Surface: [Data Tampering (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/data_tampering__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*Description:* An attacker intercepts and modifies the communication *between the `geocoder` library and the external geocoding service*.
*How `geocoder` Contributes:* The library *handles the network communication* with the external services. This is the *direct* point of vulnerability.
*Example:* The `geocoder` library (or its underlying HTTP client) is misconfigured and doesn't properly validate TLS certificates. An attacker performs a MitM attack, providing a fake certificate and intercepting/modifying data.
*Impact:* Incorrect location data is used by the application.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:* Ensure `geocoder` (and its HTTP client) *always* uses HTTPS and *strictly* validates TLS certificates. Consider certificate pinning (with careful planning). Use a well-vetted and up-to-date HTTP client library.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `geocoder` or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__geocoder__or_dependencies.md)

*Description:* Security vulnerabilities exist *within the `geocoder` library itself* or in one of its *direct* dependencies.
*How `geocoder` Contributes:* The library *is* the potential source of the vulnerability, or it *directly introduces* the vulnerable dependency.
*Example:* A vulnerability is found in the `requests` library (a common dependency of `geocoder`) that allows for request smuggling. An attacker exploits this through `geocoder` to access internal services.
*Impact:* Varies; potentially denial of service, data breaches, or (less likely, but possible) remote code execution.
*Risk Severity:* **High** / **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:* Keep `geocoder` and *all* its dependencies updated. Use dependency management tools. Perform security audits and vulnerability scans. Monitor security advisories. Use SCA tools.
