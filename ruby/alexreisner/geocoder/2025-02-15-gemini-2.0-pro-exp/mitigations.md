## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement `geocoder`'s Rate Limiting and Retry Logic](./mitigation_strategies/implement__geocoder_'s_rate_limiting_and_retry_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Provider-Specific Settings:** Consult the `geocoder` documentation for *each* geocoding provider you are using (e.g., Google, OSM, etc.).  Locate the sections detailing rate limiting, quotas, and any provider-specific retry mechanisms.  Different providers have different APIs and settings within `geocoder`.
    2.  **Configure Retries (Exponential Backoff):**  Within your `geocoder` configuration (likely where you initialize the provider), explicitly enable automatic retries with *exponential backoff*.  This is often done through parameters passed to the provider's initialization function.  For example:
        ```python
        import geocoder

        g = geocoder.google("Mountain View, CA", key="YOUR_API_KEY",
                             retry=5,  # Retry up to 5 times
                             backoff_factor=2) # Double the delay between retries
        ```
        (The exact parameters will vary by provider; consult the `geocoder` documentation).
    3.  **Set Timeout:**  Configure a reasonable timeout (in seconds) for each geocoding request.  This prevents your application from hanging indefinitely if the service is unavailable.  This is also usually a parameter to the provider's initialization:
        ```python
        g = geocoder.google("Mountain View, CA", key="YOUR_API_KEY",
                             timeout=10) # Timeout after 10 seconds
        ```
    4.  **Handle `geocoder`-Specific Exceptions:**  Wrap your `geocoder` calls in `try...except` blocks to specifically catch exceptions raised by `geocoder` itself, such as `geocoder.exceptions.OverQueryLimit`, `geocoder.exceptions.RequestDenied`, or provider-specific error classes.  Log these errors appropriately.
        ```python
        import geocoder
        from geocoder.exceptions import OverQueryLimit, RequestDenied

        try:
            g = geocoder.google("Mountain View, CA", key="YOUR_API_KEY")
            # ... use g.latlng, g.address, etc. ...
        except OverQueryLimit:
            print("Over query limit!")
            # Handle rate limiting (e.g., wait, notify user)
        except RequestDenied:
            print("Request denied!")
            # Handle other request errors
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            # Handle general errors
        ```
    5.  **Provider-Specific Parameters:** Some providers may have additional parameters for fine-tuning rate limiting behavior (e.g., setting a custom delay between requests).  Explore the `geocoder` documentation for your chosen providers to see if any such options are available and beneficial.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Rate Limiting/DoS (Severity: High):** Helps the application gracefully handle rate limit errors from the geocoding service and avoid being completely blocked.
    *   **Application Instability (Severity: Medium):** Prevents `geocoder` errors from crashing the entire application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Rate Limiting/DoS:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).  Without caching or queueing, you're still vulnerable to exceeding limits, but the application handles it more gracefully.
    *   **Application Instability:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic timeout settings are configured in `geocoder_config.py`, but retries with exponential backoff are *not* explicitly enabled for all providers.  The error handling in `geocode_utils.py` does not specifically catch `geocoder` exceptions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly enable and configure retries with exponential backoff in `geocoder_config.py` for *each* provider being used.  This requires reviewing the `geocoder` documentation for each provider.
    *   Improve error handling in `geocode_utils.py` (and any other modules using `geocoder`) to specifically catch and log `geocoder`-specific exceptions (like `OverQueryLimit`).  This provides better diagnostics and allows for more targeted error handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS and Certificate Validation (Verification within `geocoder`)](./mitigation_strategies/https_and_certificate_validation__verification_within__geocoder__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Default Behavior:** Examine the `geocoder` library's source code (or its documentation) to confirm that it uses HTTPS by default for all requests to the geocoding services.  Most modern libraries do this, but it's crucial to verify.  Look for how `geocoder` interacts with underlying HTTP libraries (like `requests`).
    2.  **Explicit Configuration (If Necessary):** If, for some reason, HTTPS is *not* the default, or if you need to customize the SSL/TLS settings, check the `geocoder` documentation for provider-specific options.  There might be parameters to force HTTPS or to configure certificate validation.  This is *unlikely* to be necessary, but it's good to be aware of the possibility.
    3.  **Underlying Library Configuration:**  Since `geocoder` likely relies on an underlying HTTP library (e.g., `requests`), understand how that library handles certificate validation.  `requests`, for example, validates certificates by default.  Ensure that this default behavior is *not* overridden.  *Never* disable certificate validation in a production environment.
    4. **Test with Invalid Certificates (Testing Environment Only):** In a *controlled testing environment*, you could temporarily configure `geocoder` (or the underlying HTTP library) to *not* validate certificates.  This allows you to test how your application handles certificate errors.  This should *never* be done in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Ensures that communication with the geocoding service is encrypted and that the server's identity is verified, preventing attackers from intercepting or modifying data.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (Severity: High):** Protects the confidentiality of geocoding queries and responses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Very Low), assuming `geocoder` and its underlying library correctly handle HTTPS and certificate validation.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Very Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** `geocoder` uses the `requests` library, which validates certificates by default. This is implicitly implemented and considered secure.

*   **Missing Implementation:** While the underlying mechanism is secure, there's no *explicit* check or configuration *within our application code* that specifically targets `geocoder`'s HTTPS behavior.  This is more about *verification* than missing implementation.  We could add a simple test case that attempts to use `geocoder` with a deliberately invalid certificate (in a testing environment) to confirm that the expected error occurs. This would provide extra assurance.
