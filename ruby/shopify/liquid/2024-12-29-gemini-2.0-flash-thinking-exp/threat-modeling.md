### High and Critical Liquid Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Shopify Liquid templating engine:

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid code into template data or directly into a template string. This code is then processed by the Liquid engine on the server. The attacker might use Liquid syntax to access server-side objects, execute system commands (if the underlying environment allows), or read sensitive files. They could manipulate Liquid objects and filters to achieve unintended actions. This directly leverages Liquid's parsing and execution capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breach, denial of service, and potential takeover of the application.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Liquid::Template`, `Liquid::Context`, `Liquid::Block`, `Liquid::Variable`, potentially custom tags and filters if they interact with the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Encoding:** Always encode Liquid output based on the context (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages).
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize or use allow-lists for any user-provided data that is incorporated into Liquid templates.
        *   **Secure Template Management:** Control access to template files and restrict who can create or modify them.
        *   **Sandboxing/Restricted Environment:** If possible, run Liquid in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review Liquid templates for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application user running the Liquid engine has minimal necessary permissions.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Liquid Output
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the data or context provided to the Liquid engine, or exploits flaws in template logic *within Liquid*, to cause the engine to output sensitive information that was not intended for public display. This involves Liquid's direct access to and rendering of data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to further attacks or compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Liquid::Context`, `Liquid::Variable`, `Liquid::Filter` (if filters are used to access or format sensitive data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Data:** Only provide the necessary data to the Liquid context for rendering. Avoid exposing entire objects or datasets.
        *   **Careful Variable Scoping:** Ensure variables are scoped appropriately within Liquid templates to prevent unintended access.
        *   **Secure Filter Implementation:** If custom filters are used, ensure they do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.
        *   **Regular Review of Templates:** Check for logic flaws that could lead to information leakage.

*   **Threat:** Security Control Bypass through Liquid Output Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages Liquid's ability to generate dynamic content to bypass security controls. For example, they might craft Liquid code that generates HTML bypassing client-side sanitization or escaping mechanisms, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the output is rendered in a web browser. This directly involves how Liquid constructs output.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security measures can lead to various attacks, including XSS, where attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Liquid::Variable`, `Liquid::Filter` (if used for output formatting), `Liquid::Block` (if used to structure output).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure Liquid output is encoded correctly for the specific context where it is used (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML, URL encoding for URLs).
        *   **Avoid Relying Solely on Client-Side Security:** Implement server-side security measures as the primary defense.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS.
