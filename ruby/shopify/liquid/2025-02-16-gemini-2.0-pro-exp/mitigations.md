# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for shopify/liquid

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Liquid's `strict_variables` and `strict_filters` Modes](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_liquid's__strict_variables__and__strict_filters__modes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Modes:**  When initializing the `Liquid::Template` object in your server-side code (e.g., Ruby), set the `strict_variables` and `strict_filters` options to `true`.  This is done *at the point of Liquid instantiation*, making it a Liquid-specific configuration.
        ```ruby
        template = Liquid::Template.parse(template_string, strict_variables: true, strict_filters: true)
        ```
    2.  **Error Handling:**  Wrap the template rendering process in a `begin...rescue` block (or your language's equivalent) to catch `Liquid::UndefinedVariable` and `Liquid::UndefinedFilter` exceptions.  This error handling is directly related to the Liquid engine's behavior.
    3.  **Log Errors:**  Log any exceptions caught, including the context (template name, input data, etc.). This logging is triggered by Liquid's error handling.
    4.  **User-Friendly Error (Optional):**  Optionally, display a generic error message to the user (do *not* reveal the specific error details). This is a consequence of Liquid's error.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low):** Helps catch unintentional use of undefined variables or filters, which could lead to unexpected behavior or data leakage.  Primarily a debugging aid.
    *   **Limited Template Injection (Severity: Low):**  Provides a *very* limited defense against certain types of template injection attempts that rely on undefined variables or filters.  This is *not* a reliable defense against template injection, but it *is* a direct consequence of Liquid's configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.
    *   **Limited Template Injection:**  Minimal impact; risk remains High without other mitigations (like input validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Development Environment:** Enabled in the development environment configuration (`config/environments/development.rb`).
    *   **Test Environment:** Enabled in the test environment configuration (`config/environments/test.rb`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Production Environment:**  Not currently enabled in production (`config/environments/production.rb`).  We need to evaluate whether our application logic is robust enough to guarantee that all variables and filters will always be defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `render`, `include` with Dynamic Paths (Within Liquid)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__render____include__with_dynamic_paths__within_liquid_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Paths:**  Within your Liquid templates, search for any instances of `{% render ... %}` or `{% include ... %}` where the template path is determined, even partially, by a Liquid variable that could be influenced by user input.
    2.  **Replace with Hardcoded Paths:**  If possible, replace these dynamic paths with hardcoded, known-safe paths *within the Liquid template itself*.  This is a direct modification of the Liquid code.
        ```liquid
        <!-- BAD: Potentially dynamic -->
        {% render some_variable %}

        <!-- GOOD: Hardcoded -->
        {% render 'partials/my_safe_partial' %}
        ```
    3.  **Implement Whitelist (Server-Side, but Affects Liquid):** If dynamic template selection is absolutely required, the *decision* of which template to use must happen on the server-side, and a *safe, pre-approved value* should be passed to Liquid. The Liquid template then uses this safe value. This is a combination of server-side logic and Liquid usage. The key is that the *Liquid template itself* never directly handles potentially unsafe input for the path.
    4. **Conditional Rendering (Alternative):** Consider refactoring your *Liquid templates* to use conditional logic (`{% if ... %}{% elsif ... %}{% else %}{% endif %}`) within a single template, rather than dynamically including different templates. This is a direct change to the Liquid code to avoid the `render`/`include` issue.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from accessing arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the template path *through* Liquid.
    *   **Template Injection (Severity: High):**  By controlling which templates are included *via* Liquid, reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious Liquid code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from High to Very Low.
    *   **Template Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Main Layout Templates:**  The main layout templates (`app/views/layouts/`) use hardcoded paths within the Liquid files.
    *   **Partial Views:** Most partial views are included using hardcoded paths within the Liquid files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **User-Generated Content Sections:**  The Liquid template in the user profile section needs to be refactored to use either hardcoded paths or server-side whitelisting, ensuring the Liquid code itself doesn't handle potentially unsafe paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Extremely Cautious with Custom Filters and Tags (Within Liquid's Implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/be_extremely_cautious_with_custom_filters_and_tags__within_liquid's_implementation_.md)

*   **Description:** This strategy focuses on the *implementation* of the custom filters and tags *themselves*, which are part of how Liquid functions in your application.
    1.  **Identify Custom Components:**  List all custom Liquid filters and tags defined in your application.
    2.  **Input Validation (Within Components):**  Within the Ruby (or other language) code that *defines* the custom filter or tag, validate and sanitize *all* input received. This code is directly extending Liquid's functionality.
    3.  **Avoid System Calls:**  Ensure the code defining the custom filter or tag *never* executes system commands or accesses sensitive resources directly. This is a restriction on the *implementation* of the Liquid extension.
    4.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the code for your custom filters and tags has only the minimum necessary permissions. This applies to the environment in which the Liquid extensions are executed.
    5.  **Thorough Testing:**  Create unit tests and integration tests for each custom filter and tag, specifically testing with various inputs. This testing focuses on the behavior of the *Liquid extensions*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into your custom filters and tags, which are executed as part of Liquid's processing.
    *   **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium-High):**  By controlling what data is accessed and processed within the filter/tag (part of Liquid's extended functionality), reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.
    *   **System Compromise (Severity: Critical):**  By avoiding system calls within the Liquid extension code, prevents attackers from gaining control of the server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (depending on the complexity of the filter/tag).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from Medium-High to Low.
    *   **System Compromise:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`format_date` Filter:**  This custom filter (part of our Liquid implementation) formats dates. It includes basic validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`generate_widget` Tag:**  This custom tag (part of our Liquid implementation) lacks input validation and needs a complete rewrite.
    * **Review of all custom filters and tags:** A complete security review of all custom filters and tags (all part of our extended Liquid functionality) is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Variable/Filter Names from User Input (Within Liquid):](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_variablefilter_names_from_user_input__within_liquid_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Dynamic Access:** Within your *Liquid templates*, search for any instances where a Liquid variable is used to construct the *name* of another variable or filter being accessed (e.g., `{{ object[variable_name] }}`). The `variable_name` here could be influenced by user input.
    2. **Replace with Static Access:** Refactor the *Liquid template code* to use static variable and filter names whenever possible.
        ```liquid
        <!-- BAD: Potentially dynamic -->
        {{ object[some_variable] }}

        <!-- GOOD: Static -->
        {{ object.my_safe_field }}
        ```
    3. **Whitelist (Server-Side, but Affects Liquid):** If dynamic access is unavoidable, the *decision* of which variable/filter to access must happen on the server-side. A *safe, pre-approved value* should be passed to Liquid. The Liquid template then uses this safe value. The key is that the *Liquid template itself* never directly handles potentially unsafe input for the variable/filter name.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Template Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from accessing arbitrary variables or filters *through* Liquid, potentially exposing sensitive data or manipulating the application's behavior.

* **Impact:**
    * **Template Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * **Generally Avoided:** We generally avoid this pattern in our Liquid templates.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * **Code Review:** A thorough review of all Liquid templates is needed to confirm that there are *no* instances of this vulnerability. We need to add a specific check for this pattern to our Liquid template review checklist.
