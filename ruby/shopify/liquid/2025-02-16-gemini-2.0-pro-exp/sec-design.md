Okay, let's create a design document for the Shopify Liquid project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Shopify Liquid is a template engine created by Shopify and written in Ruby. It is used to load dynamic content on storefronts and other applications.  It's a core component of the Shopify platform and is also open-sourced and used by other projects (like Jekyll).

Priorities and Goals:

*   Reliability: Liquid must be highly reliable, as any failures or instability directly impact the availability and functionality of Shopify stores and other applications using it.
*   Performance:  Liquid templates need to be rendered quickly to ensure fast page load times for storefronts, impacting user experience and potentially sales.
*   Security:  As a template engine handling potentially untrusted input (template code), security is paramount to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and data leakage.
*   Maintainability:  The codebase should be maintainable and extensible to allow for new features, bug fixes, and ongoing support.
*   Usability: The template language should be easy to learn and use for theme developers and content creators.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   RCE in Liquid parsing:  A malicious actor crafting a specially designed Liquid template that exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the highest risk.
*   Denial of Service (DoS):  A malicious actor crafting a template that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) leading to a denial of service for the storefront or application.
*   Data Leakage:  A vulnerability that allows sensitive data (e.g., customer information, internal configuration) to be exposed through the template engine.
*   XSS: While Liquid itself aims to prevent XSS, improper usage or vulnerabilities in custom filters/tags could introduce XSS risks.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of dependencies used by Liquid, leading to the introduction of malicious code.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input Validation: Liquid has built-in mechanisms to sanitize and escape output, reducing the risk of XSS. (Described in Liquid documentation and source code).
*   security control: Limited Functionality: Liquid intentionally restricts access to the underlying system and filesystem, preventing direct execution of system commands. (Described in Liquid documentation).
*   security control: Resource Limits: Liquid provides mechanisms to limit resource consumption (e.g., rendering time, memory usage) to mitigate DoS attacks. (Described in Liquid documentation and source code).
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Shopify likely conducts regular security audits and penetration testing of Liquid as part of its overall security program. (Assumed based on Shopify's security practices).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Shopify likely uses dependency management tools (e.g., Bundler) to manage and update Liquid's dependencies, reducing the risk of known vulnerabilities. (Observed in the repository).
*   security control: Code Reviews: The open-source nature of Liquid encourages community code reviews, which can help identify and address security issues. (Observed in the repository).
*   security control: Static Analysis: Shopify likely uses static analysis tools to scan the Liquid codebase for potential vulnerabilities. (Assumed based on industry best practices).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complex Template Logic: While Liquid limits functionality, complex or poorly written templates can still lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.
*   accepted risk: Custom Filters/Tags: Users can extend Liquid with custom filters and tags, which introduce a potential attack surface if not carefully implemented.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: While dependency management is in place, there's always a residual risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Provide clear documentation and guidelines for developers on securely implementing custom filters and tags.
*   Implement a regular dynamic application security testing (DAST) program to identify vulnerabilities in running instances of Liquid.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of protection against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to Liquid itself, as it's a template engine. Authentication is handled by the application using Liquid.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to Liquid itself. Authorization is handled by the application using Liquid. However, Liquid should provide mechanisms to access user context information (if available) in a secure manner.
*   Input Validation: Liquid must rigorously validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks. This includes template code, variables, and data passed to filters.
*   Cryptography: Liquid should use secure cryptographic practices when handling sensitive data (e.g., hashing passwords, encrypting data). This is more relevant to the application using Liquid, but Liquid should provide secure helpers for common cryptographic tasks if needed.
*   Output Encoding: Liquid must properly encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This should be automatic and transparent to the user.

## BUILD

The Liquid project uses a combination of Rake and Bundler for build and dependency management.  It does not appear to have a dedicated CI/CD pipeline in the public repository, but Shopify likely has internal CI/CD processes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer([Developer]) --> GitHubRepo([GitHub Repository])
    GitHubRepo -- "git clone" --> LocalMachine([Local Machine])
    LocalMachine -- "bundle install" --> Dependencies([Dependencies (RubyGems)])
    LocalMachine -- "rake test" --> TestResults([Test Results])
    LocalMachine -- "gem build" --> LiquidGem([Liquid Gem File])
    LiquidGem -- "gem push" --> RubyGemsOrg([RubyGems.org])

```
Build Process Description:

1.  Developer clones the repository from GitHub.
2.  Dependencies are installed using `bundle install`.
3.  Tests are run using `rake test`.
4.  A gem file is built using `gem build liquid.gemspec`.
5.  The gem is published to RubyGems.org using `gem push`.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency Management (Bundler): Bundler helps manage dependencies and ensures consistent versions, reducing the risk of using vulnerable libraries.
*   security control: Automated Testing (Rake): The test suite helps identify bugs and regressions, including potential security issues.
*   security control: Code Reviews (GitHub): The open-source nature of the project encourages community code reviews.
*   security control: (Likely Internal) Static Analysis: Shopify likely uses static analysis tools internally to scan the codebase.
*   security control: (Likely Internal) Vulnerability Scanning: Shopify likely uses vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Rendering storefronts and displaying dynamic content.
*   Processing Liquid templates submitted by theme developers.
*   Maintaining the availability and performance of Shopify stores.

Data to Protect:

*   Liquid template code (Sensitivity: Medium - Contains logic, but should not contain secrets directly).
*   Data passed to Liquid templates (Sensitivity: Variable - Can range from public product information to sensitive customer data, depending on the context).  The application using Liquid is responsible for protecting this data.
*   Shopify internal configuration (Sensitivity: High - Should not be accessible through Liquid).
