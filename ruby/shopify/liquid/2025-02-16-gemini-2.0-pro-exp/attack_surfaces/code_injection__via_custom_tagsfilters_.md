Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Code Injection (via Custom Tags/Filters)" attack surface for applications using the Shopify Liquid templating engine, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Code Injection via Custom Liquid Tags/Filters

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with code injection vulnerabilities arising from custom Liquid tags and filters.  This includes:

*   Identifying specific attack vectors.
*   Assessing the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.
*   Developing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation beyond the high-level strategies already identified.
*   Providing developers with clear guidance on secure coding practices for custom Liquid extensions.
*   Establishing a framework for ongoing monitoring and vulnerability management related to this attack surface.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface presented by *custom* Liquid tags and filters written in Ruby.  It does *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the core Liquid library itself (these are assumed to be addressed by the Liquid maintainers).
*   Other attack vectors unrelated to custom extensions (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection in the application's main codebase).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party Liquid extensions *unless* they are directly integrated and modified by our team.  We will, however, address the *general* risk of using third-party extensions.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine hypothetical and (if available) real-world examples of vulnerable custom tag/filter implementations.  This will involve static analysis of Ruby code.
*   **Threat Modeling:** We will construct threat models to identify potential attack scenarios and attacker motivations.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to Ruby code injection and dynamic code execution.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will consult established secure coding guidelines for Ruby and web application development.
*   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** We will conceptually design penetration tests that could be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in custom tags/filters.  (Actual penetration testing is outside the scope of this *analysis* document, but this section informs future testing efforts.)

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Techniques

The core vulnerability lies in the ability of custom tags and filters to execute arbitrary Ruby code.  Here are specific attack vectors:

*   **Direct `eval` or `instance_eval` Usage:**  The most obvious and dangerous vector.  Any user-supplied input passed directly to `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, or similar methods creates an immediate code injection vulnerability.

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    Liquid::Template.register_filter(Module.new do
      def unsafe_filter(input)
        eval(input)
      end
    end)
    ```

*   **Indirect Code Execution via `send` or `public_send`:**  These methods allow calling methods dynamically based on a string.  If the method name or arguments are derived from user input, it can lead to code execution.

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    Liquid::Template.register_filter(Module.new do
      def unsafe_send(obj, method_name, arg)
        obj.send(method_name, arg) # method_name and arg could be attacker-controlled
      end
    end)
    ```

*   **String Interpolation with Unsafe Methods:**  Even without `eval`, string interpolation within methods like `system`, `exec`, `` ` ` ``, `open`, or file I/O operations can be dangerous.

    ```ruby
    # VULNERABLE
    Liquid::Template.register_tag('unsafe_tag', Class.new(Liquid::Tag) do
      def initialize(tag_name, input, tokens)
        super
        @input = input
      end

      def render(context)
        `echo #{@input}`  # Command injection via string interpolation
      end
    end)
    ```

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** If custom tags/filters deserialize data (e.g., YAML, JSON, Marshal) from user input, they could be vulnerable to object injection attacks.  This is particularly relevant if the deserialized data is used to instantiate objects or call methods.

    ```ruby
    # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE (depends on how the deserialized data is used)
    require 'yaml'
    Liquid::Template.register_filter(Module.new do
      def unsafe_yaml(input)
        YAML.load(input)
      end
    end)
    ```

*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** While not direct code execution, poorly crafted regular expressions used for input validation within custom tags/filters can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  This is due to catastrophic backtracking.

    ```ruby
    # POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE (ReDoS)
    Liquid::Template.register_filter(Module.new do
      def unsafe_regex(input)
        input =~ /^(a+)+$/ # Example of a vulnerable regex
      end
    end)
    ```
*  **Using Unsafe Third-Party Libraries:** If a custom tag or filter uses a third-party Ruby gem that itself has a code injection vulnerability, the Liquid extension inherits that vulnerability.

### 4.2. Likelihood and Impact

*   **Likelihood:** High.  The attack surface is directly exposed to user input through Liquid templates.  The complexity of exploiting a vulnerability depends on the specific implementation, but the fundamental attack vector is straightforward.  The prevalence of developers unfamiliar with secure coding practices in Ruby increases the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:** Critical.  Successful code injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process.  This typically leads to:
    *   **Complete Server Compromise:**  The attacker can gain full control of the server.
    *   **Data Theft:**  Access to sensitive data, including customer information, databases, and source code.
    *   **Data Modification:**  Alteration or deletion of data.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Making the application unavailable.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised server to attack other systems.
    *   **Installation of Malware:**  Installing backdoors, rootkits, or other malicious software.

### 4.3. Concrete Mitigation Recommendations

Beyond the high-level strategies, here are specific, actionable recommendations:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Define *exactly* what input is allowed.  Reject anything that doesn't match.  For example, if a filter expects a number, use `Integer(input)` and rescue `ArgumentError` to handle invalid input.  If it expects a specific set of strings, use an array and check for membership: `['option1', 'option2', 'option3'].include?(input)`.
    *   **Type Checking:**  Enforce strict type checking.  Use methods like `is_a?` to ensure input is of the expected type (e.g., `input.is_a?(String)`).
    *   **Length Restrictions:**  Impose maximum length limits on input strings to prevent buffer overflows or excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Regular Expressions (Carefully):**  If regular expressions are *necessary*, use them with extreme caution.  Avoid complex, nested quantifiers.  Use tools like Rubular to test for ReDoS vulnerabilities.  Consider using a regex timeout.
    *   **Encoding:**  Ensure proper encoding of output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the output of the filter is rendered in HTML.  Liquid's built-in escaping mechanisms should be sufficient in most cases, but be aware of context.
    *   **Never Trust Input:** Treat *all* input as potentially malicious, even if it comes from seemingly trusted sources (e.g., database values, other parts of the application).

2.  **Avoid Dangerous Functions:**

    *   **Prohibit `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, `send`, `public_send`, `` ` ` ``, `system`, `exec`, `open` (with untrusted input), and similar methods.**  There are almost always safer alternatives.
    *   **Safe Alternatives:**
        *   For dynamic method calls, use a whitelist of allowed methods:

            ```ruby
            ALLOWED_METHODS = {
              'add' => :+,
              'subtract' => :-
            }

            def safe_operation(obj, operation, arg)
              if ALLOWED_METHODS.key?(operation)
                obj.send(ALLOWED_METHODS[operation], arg)
              else
                # Handle invalid operation
              end
            end
            ```

        *   For string interpolation in shell commands, use the `Shellwords` library to properly escape arguments:

            ```ruby
            require 'shellwords'
            def safe_command(input)
              command = "echo #{Shellwords.escape(input)}"
              `#{command}`
            end
            ```

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**

    *   **Run the web server process with the lowest possible privileges.**  Do *not* run it as root.
    *   **Use a dedicated user account for the application.**  This account should have limited access to the file system and other resources.
    *   **Consider using a containerization technology like Docker to isolate the application.**  This limits the impact of a successful compromise.

4.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**

    *   **Explore Ruby sandboxing libraries:**  Libraries like `SafeRuby` or `Jail` can restrict the capabilities of Ruby code, limiting the damage an attacker can do.  However, sandboxing is complex and can be bypassed if not configured correctly.  Thorough testing is essential.
    *   **Consider using a separate process or even a separate server for executing custom Liquid extensions.**  This provides a higher level of isolation.

5.  **Dependency Management:**

    *   **Regularly update all Ruby gems used by custom tags/filters.**  Use a dependency management tool like Bundler.
    *   **Audit third-party gems for security vulnerabilities before using them.**  Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `gemnasium`.
    *   **Pin gem versions to specific, known-safe versions.**  Avoid using wildcard versions (e.g., `gem 'some_gem', '~> 1.0'`) which can automatically upgrade to vulnerable versions.

6.  **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**

    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for *all* custom Liquid extensions.  The reviewer should specifically look for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools like RuboCop (with security-focused rules), Brakeman, and Dawnscanner to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the entire application, including custom Liquid extensions.

7.  **Logging and Monitoring:**

    *   **Log all input to custom tags and filters.**  This helps with debugging and auditing.
    *   **Monitor for suspicious activity, such as unusual system calls or file access.**
    *   **Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).**

8. **Safe Deserialization:**
    * If using YAML, consider using `YAML.safe_load` which prevents the instantiation of arbitrary Ruby objects.
    * For JSON, use a reputable JSON parsing library (like the built-in `json` gem) and avoid custom deserialization logic.
    * Avoid using `Marshal` for untrusted data.

### 4.4. Developer Guidance

*   **Training:** Provide developers with training on secure coding practices in Ruby, specifically focusing on the risks associated with dynamic code execution and input validation.
*   **Documentation:** Create clear, concise documentation on how to write secure custom Liquid tags and filters.  Include examples of both vulnerable and secure code.
*   **Checklists:** Develop checklists that developers can use to ensure they have addressed all relevant security considerations.
*   **Code Examples:** Provide a library of pre-approved, secure code snippets that developers can use as a starting point.

### 4.5. Penetration Testing (Conceptual)

A penetration test targeting this attack surface would involve:

1.  **Identify Custom Tags/Filters:**  Examine the application's codebase and configuration to identify all custom Liquid extensions.
2.  **Input Fuzzing:**  Send a wide range of specially crafted inputs to each custom tag/filter, including:
    *   Valid inputs.
    *   Invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect types, excessive lengths).
    *   Potentially malicious inputs (e.g., Ruby code snippets, shell commands, serialized objects).
3.  **Monitor for Errors and Unexpected Behavior:**  Observe the application's logs, error messages, and behavior for any signs of successful code injection or other vulnerabilities.
4.  **Attempt to Escalate Privileges:**  If code execution is achieved, attempt to escalate privileges and gain access to sensitive data or system resources.
5.  **Report Findings:**  Document all identified vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.

## 5. Conclusion

Code injection via custom Liquid tags and filters represents a critical security risk.  By implementing the comprehensive mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of successful attacks.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and ongoing developer training are essential to maintaining a secure application.  The key takeaway is to treat *all* user input as potentially malicious and to avoid dynamic code execution whenever possible.  When dynamic code execution is unavoidable, it must be implemented with extreme caution and rigorous security controls.
