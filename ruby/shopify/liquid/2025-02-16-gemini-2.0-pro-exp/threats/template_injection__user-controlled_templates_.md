Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Template Injection (User-Controlled Templates)" threat, tailored for a development team using Shopify's Liquid templating engine:

# Deep Analysis: Template Injection (User-Controlled Templates) in Liquid

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of template injection vulnerabilities within the context of Shopify's Liquid.
*   Identify specific attack vectors and potential payloads that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Provide actionable recommendations to the development team to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.
*   Provide examples of vulnerable code and secure code.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Template Injection (User-Controlled Templates)" threat as described in the provided threat model.  It considers:

*   The Liquid templating engine as implemented by Shopify (github.com/shopify/liquid).
*   Scenarios where user input directly or indirectly influences the rendered Liquid template.
*   The potential impact on application availability (denial of service) and confidentiality (information disclosure).
*   The limitations of Liquid's built-in security features.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
*   Vulnerabilities in Shopify's platform itself (this is focused on application-level vulnerabilities).
*   Client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) that might arise from *output* of the Liquid template (though we'll touch on how to prevent generating vulnerable output).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Review the threat description and relevant Liquid documentation.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Identify specific ways an attacker could inject malicious Liquid code.
3.  **Payload Construction:**  Develop example payloads to demonstrate the potential impact.
4.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Provide clear, actionable recommendations for the development team.
6.  **Code Examples:** Provide examples of vulnerable and secure code snippets.

## 2. Threat Understanding

Liquid is designed as a *safe* templating language, meaning it's intentionally limited in its capabilities to prevent arbitrary code execution.  It doesn't allow direct access to the underlying system or database.  However, "safe" doesn't mean "invulnerable."  The core vulnerability lies in allowing users to control the *structure* of the template itself, rather than just providing data to be inserted into a pre-defined template.

Key points from the Liquid documentation and design relevant to this threat:

*   **Tags and Filters:** Liquid uses tags (`{% ... %}`) for logic and filters (`{{ ... | filter }}`) for data manipulation.  Certain tags and filters are inherently more powerful (and thus riskier) than others.
*   **No Arbitrary Code Execution:** Liquid does not allow execution of arbitrary Ruby code (the language it's built on).
*   **Limited Variable Access:**  The context in which a template is rendered determines which variables are accessible.  This is a key security mechanism.
*   **Error Handling:** Liquid's error handling can sometimes reveal information about the internal state.

## 3. Attack Vector Analysis

The primary attack vector is any input field or mechanism that allows a user to directly or indirectly influence the Liquid template code that gets rendered.  Examples include:

*   **Direct Template Input:** A form field where users can enter a full Liquid template.  This is the most obvious and dangerous scenario.
*   **Template Selection:**  A dropdown or other control that lets users choose from a set of pre-defined templates, but where the selection mechanism is vulnerable to manipulation (e.g., an attacker could submit an invalid template ID).
*   **Indirect Influence via Variables:**  Even if users can't directly input template code, if they can control the *names* of variables that are used in the template, they might be able to influence the template's behavior.  This is less likely but still a potential concern.
* **Vulnerable include tag:** If the `include` tag is used with user-controlled input, it could lead to template injection.

## 4. Payload Construction

Let's explore some potential payloads, assuming an attacker has *some* control over the template:

### 4.1. Denial of Service (DoS)

The easiest attack to achieve is a denial of service.  Liquid has limitations that make infinite loops difficult, but resource exhaustion is still possible.

*   **Nested Loops (if possible):**
    ```liquid
    {% for i in (1..10000) %}
      {% for j in (1..10000) %}
        {% assign x = 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' %}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
    ```
    This attempts to create a very large number of nested loops and allocate a large string repeatedly.  The effectiveness depends on Liquid's resource limits.

*   **Large String Concatenation:**
    ```liquid
    {% assign long_string = "a" %}
    {% for i in (1..10000) %}
      {% assign long_string = long_string | append: "a" %}
    {% endfor %}
    {{ long_string }}
    ```
    This tries to build a massive string in memory.

* **Abuse of `include` (if user controls the included template name):**
    ```liquid
    {% include payload %}
    ```
    Where `payload` is a variable controlled by the attacker, pointing to a malicious template designed for DoS.

### 4.2. Information Disclosure (Limited)

Information disclosure is more challenging due to Liquid's sandboxing, but not impossible.

*   **Error Messages:**  Intentionally causing Liquid errors might reveal information about the template's context or internal variables.  This depends heavily on the application's error handling.
    ```liquid
    {{ undefined_variable }}
    ```
    This would likely result in an error, potentially revealing the names of defined variables if error messages are displayed to the user.

*   **Accessing `forloop` object properties:**
    ```liquid
    {% for item in items %}
        {{ forloop }}
    {% endfor %}
    ```
    This could expose some internal information about the loop.

* **Conditional Logic Based on System Variables (Highly Unlikely):** If, hypothetically, the application exposed some internal state variables to the Liquid context (which it *shouldn't*), an attacker might be able to probe those variables using conditional logic. This is a very contrived example, but it illustrates the principle.

    ```liquid
    {% if internal_flag == true %}
      Sensitive Data
    {% else %}
      Normal Data
    {% endif %}
    ```

## 5. Mitigation Evaluation

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Prohibit User-Provided Templates:**  This is the **most effective** and **recommended** mitigation.  It completely eliminates the attack vector.  This should be the default approach.

*   **Whitelist Approach:**  If user input *must* influence the template, a strict whitelist of allowed variables and filters is crucial.  This is a good second line of defense, but it requires careful implementation and maintenance.  It's easy to accidentally allow something dangerous.  The whitelist should be as restrictive as possible.

*   **Restricted Context:**  Using a separate, highly restricted Liquid context is an excellent practice.  This limits the attacker's access to potentially sensitive data even if they manage to inject some code.  This should be used in conjunction with the whitelist approach.

*   **Alternative Templating Engine:**  If user-provided templates are a *requirement*, Liquid is the **wrong tool for the job**.  A different templating engine, specifically designed for untrusted input and with robust sandboxing, should be used.  This is a significant architectural decision.

## 6. Recommendations

1.  **Never allow users to directly input or modify Liquid template code.** This is the most important recommendation.
2.  **If user input must influence the output, use a strict whitelist of allowed variables and filters.**  Define this whitelist explicitly in your code and rigorously test it.
3.  **Create a separate, highly restricted Liquid context for rendering any user-influenced content.**  This context should have minimal access to variables and filters.  Only expose the absolute minimum data required.
4.  **Sanitize all user input *before* it's used in the Liquid context.**  This helps prevent unexpected behavior and potential bypasses of the whitelist.  Use appropriate escaping functions for the intended output format (e.g., HTML escaping).
5.  **Implement robust error handling that does *not* reveal internal details to the user.**  Log errors securely for debugging, but display generic error messages to the user.
6.  **Regularly review and update your Liquid templates and security measures.**  As Liquid evolves, new features or potential vulnerabilities might be discovered.
7.  **Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to identify any potential weaknesses.**
8.  **Educate developers about the risks of template injection and the proper use of Liquid.**

## 7. Code Examples

### 7.1. Vulnerable Code (Direct Input)

```ruby
# In a controller (e.g., Rails)
def render_user_template
  @user_template = params[:template] # Directly from user input!
  render inline: @user_template
end
```

This is **extremely vulnerable**.  The user can provide *any* Liquid code, leading to DoS or potential information disclosure.

### 7.2. Vulnerable Code (include tag)
```ruby
# In a controller
def render_user_template
    @template_name = params[:template_name]
    render inline: "{% include #{@template_name} %}"
end
```
This code is vulnerable because it allows the user to specify which template to include.

### 7.3. Slightly Less Vulnerable (but still bad)

```ruby
# In a controller
def render_with_user_data
  @user_data = params[:data] # User-provided data
  render inline: "<h1>Hello, {{ user_data }}!</h1>" # Directly embedding user data
end
```

While this doesn't allow direct template injection, it's still vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if `user_data` contains HTML or JavaScript.  It also demonstrates how user input can directly influence the output.

### 7.4. Secure Code (Whitelist and Restricted Context)

```ruby
# In a controller
def render_safe_output
  user_name = params[:name] # Get user input

  # Sanitize the input (HTML escaping is crucial for preventing XSS)
  safe_name = ERB::Util.html_escape(user_name)

  # Create a restricted context
  context = Liquid::Context.new({}, {}, { strict_variables: true })

  # Assign only the whitelisted variable
  context['name'] = safe_name

  # Render a pre-defined template
  template = Liquid::Template.parse("<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>")
  render plain: template.render(context)
end
```

This is much more secure:

*   The template is **pre-defined**, not user-controlled.
*   User input is **sanitized** (HTML-escaped).
*   A **restricted context** is used, limiting access to variables.
*   `strict_variables: true` prevents access to undefined variables, reducing the risk of information disclosure through errors.

### 7.5 Secure Code (include tag)
```ruby
# In a controller
def render_safe_output
    allowed_templates = ["template1", "template2", "template3"]
    template_name = params[:template_name]

    if allowed_templates.include?(template_name)
        render inline: "{% include '#{template_name}' %}"
    else
        render plain: "Invalid template selected", status: :bad_request
    end
end
```
This code mitigates the risk by checking if the requested template name is in a predefined list of allowed templates.

## Conclusion

Template injection in Liquid, while limited in its potential for full code execution, is a serious vulnerability that can lead to denial of service and, in some cases, limited information disclosure. The key to preventing this vulnerability is to **absolutely prohibit user control over the template structure**. By following the recommendations and using secure coding practices, developers can effectively mitigate this threat and ensure the security of their applications. The provided code examples illustrate both vulnerable and secure approaches, providing a practical guide for implementation. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews and updates are essential.
