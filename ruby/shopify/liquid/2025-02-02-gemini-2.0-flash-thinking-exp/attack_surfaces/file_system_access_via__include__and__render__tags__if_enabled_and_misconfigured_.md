### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: File System Access via `include` and `render` Tags

#### 4.1 Detailed Explanation

The vulnerability arises from the inherent functionality of Liquid's `include` and `render` tags, which are designed to incorporate external template files into the current template being processed.  When these tags are used with dynamically constructed paths based on user-controlled input, and without proper validation, they can become a gateway to the server's file system.

**How `include` and `render` work (in the context of vulnerability):**

*   **`include` tag:**  Typically used to include reusable template snippets.  It takes a template name as an argument.  In a vulnerable scenario, this template name is directly or indirectly influenced by user input.
*   **`render` tag:** Similar to `include`, but often used for more complex template inclusions and can also accept arguments to pass data to the included template.  Like `include`, it can be vulnerable if the template name is user-controlled.

**The core problem:**

The vulnerability occurs when the application fails to adequately control the path resolution process for these tags.  If the application naively concatenates user input to form the file path for `include` or `render` without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can manipulate the input to traverse directories outside the intended template directory and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Example Breakdown:**

Consider the vulnerable code snippet:

```liquid
{% include templates/{{ page_template }}.liquid %}
```

Where `page_template` is derived from a URL parameter or user input.

*   **Intended Use:** The developer intends to include templates from the `templates/` directory based on a user-selected `page_template`. For example, if `page_template` is "product_page", it should include `templates/product_page.liquid`.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can provide an input like `../../../../etc/passwd`.  If the application directly substitutes this into the `include` tag, Liquid might attempt to resolve the path as: `templates/../../../../etc/passwd.liquid`.  Due to path traversal, this could resolve to `/etc/passwd.liquid` (or even `/etc/passwd` depending on the underlying file system and Liquid's path resolution logic). If `/etc/passwd.liquid` exists (unlikely, but the attacker might try variations without the `.liquid` extension if the application handles extensions), or if Liquid is configured to read files without enforcing extensions, the contents of `/etc/passwd` could be exposed in the rendered output.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various vectors, depending on how user input is incorporated into the `include` or `render` tag arguments:

*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** If the template name is directly taken from URL parameters (GET or POST), request headers, or other user-controlled inputs, attackers can directly inject path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate the file system.
    *   **Example:** `https://vulnerable-app.com/?template=../../../../etc/passwd`
*   **Indirect Parameter Manipulation:**  User input might be processed or transformed before being used in the `include` tag. However, if the sanitization or validation is insufficient, attackers can still craft inputs that bypass these checks and achieve path traversal.
    *   **Example:**  If the application attempts to filter out `../` but fails to handle URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f`) or double encoding, attackers can bypass the filter.
*   **Database or Configuration Injection:** In more complex scenarios, user input might influence data stored in a database or configuration file that is later used to construct template paths. If an attacker can inject malicious data into these sources, they can indirectly control the template paths used by `include` or `render`.
*   **Template Injection (Secondary):** While not directly related to `include`/`render` *tags*, if there's a separate Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability elsewhere in the application, an attacker might use SSTI to inject malicious Liquid code that *then* leverages vulnerable `include` or `render` tags to access the file system.

#### 4.3 Technical Deep Dive

**Liquid's Path Resolution (Conceptual):**

Liquid itself is designed to be a safe templating language and doesn't inherently provide direct file system access in a way that would be intentionally vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from *how the application using Liquid configures and utilizes* the `include` and `render` tags.

*   **Default Behavior:**  By default, Liquid's `include` and `render` tags are intended to load templates from a predefined set of template directories or from a template registry managed by the application.
*   **Application Responsibility:** The application using Liquid is responsible for:
    *   **Defining Template Paths:**  Configuring where Liquid should look for templates.
    *   **Handling Template Names:**  Processing the template names provided to `include` and `render` tags.
    *   **Security Controls:** Implementing necessary security checks and validations to prevent unauthorized file access.

**Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability occurs when the application fails to properly sanitize or validate the template names passed to `include` and `render`, and allows user-controlled input to directly influence the file paths used by Liquid to locate templates.  This bypasses the intended security boundaries and allows attackers to manipulate the path resolution process.

**File Extension Handling:**  The behavior regarding file extensions (e.g., `.liquid`, `.html`) can also play a role. If the application or Liquid configuration doesn't strictly enforce or validate file extensions, attackers might be able to access files without any extension, potentially including configuration files or other sensitive data.

#### 4.4 Real-world Scenarios and Examples

While specific real-world examples of this exact vulnerability in public applications using Shopify Liquid might be less documented (as it's often a misconfiguration issue in custom applications), the underlying principle of LFI via template inclusion is a well-known and exploited vulnerability across various templating engines and web frameworks.

**Realistic Scenarios:**

*   **Custom E-commerce Platforms:**  A custom e-commerce platform built using Liquid might allow merchants to customize their storefront using templates. If the platform allows merchants to specify template names based on their configuration settings or through a poorly secured admin interface, a malicious merchant or an attacker compromising a merchant account could exploit this to access server files.
*   **Content Management Systems (CMS):** A CMS using Liquid for theme rendering might allow administrators to select page layouts or templates. If the CMS doesn't properly validate the selected template names and allows them to be influenced by user input (even indirectly through database records), LFI could be possible.
*   **Internal Applications:** Internal web applications using Liquid for reporting or dashboard generation might be vulnerable if template selection is based on user roles or permissions that are not strictly enforced, or if input validation is lacking.

**Example Exploitation Steps (Conceptual):**

1.  **Identify a vulnerable parameter:** Find a URL parameter, form field, or other user-controlled input that influences the template name used in an `include` or `render` tag.
2.  **Test for path traversal:**  Inject path traversal sequences like `../`, `../../`, etc., into the vulnerable parameter and observe the application's response. Look for error messages, changes in application behavior, or content that suggests file access.
3.  **Attempt to access sensitive files:**  If path traversal is successful, try to access known sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if accessible), application configuration files, or database connection strings.
4.  **Exploit LFI:** If arbitrary file reading is confirmed, explore further exploitation possibilities, such as:
    *   Reading application source code to identify further vulnerabilities.
    *   Potentially achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) in some scenarios (though less direct with LFI, it can be a stepping stone).

#### 4.5 Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies

Beyond the initially provided mitigation strategies, here's a more detailed and comprehensive set of recommendations:

1.  **Strict Path Validation and Sanitization ( 강화된 경로 유효성 검사 및 삭제):**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all user-provided data that could influence template paths.
    *   **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or neutralize path traversal characters (`../`, `..\\`, absolute paths, etc.). Use secure path sanitization libraries or functions provided by your programming language.
    *   **Regular Expression Filtering:** Employ regular expressions to strictly match allowed template names and reject any input that deviates from the expected format.

2.  **Template Path Whitelisting (템플릿 경로 화이트리스트):**
    *   **Define Allowed Directories:**  Explicitly define a whitelist of directories where templates are allowed to be loaded from.
    *   **Restrict Path Resolution:** Configure Liquid or the application to only resolve template paths within these whitelisted directories.  Reject any template names that attempt to access paths outside the whitelist.
    *   **Centralized Template Management:**  Use a centralized template management system or registry that enforces path restrictions and access controls.

3.  **Avoid Dynamic Path Construction (동적 경로 구성 회피):**
    *   **Predefined Template Names:**  Prefer using predefined, static template names whenever possible. Avoid constructing template paths dynamically based on user input.
    *   **Indirect Mapping:** If dynamic template selection is necessary, use an indirect mapping approach.  Map user-provided identifiers to predefined template names internally, rather than directly using user input in file paths.
    *   **Configuration-Driven Selection:**  Use configuration files or databases to manage template mappings instead of directly relying on user input.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for File System Access (최소 권한 원칙):**
    *   **Restrict Application Permissions:**  Run the application process with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Prevent the application user from having read access to sensitive directories or files outside of the template directories.
    *   **Chroot/Jail Environments:** Consider using chroot jails or containerization to further isolate the application and limit its file system access.

5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (콘텐츠 보안 정책):**
    *   While CSP primarily focuses on client-side security, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of information disclosure by limiting the actions a malicious script (if injected through other vulnerabilities) can take after reading sensitive data.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (정기적인 보안 감사 및 침투 테스트):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting template injection and file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    *   Use automated security scanning tools and manual testing techniques to identify potential weaknesses in template handling.

7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (웹 애플리케이션 방화벽):**
    *   Deploy a WAF to detect and block common path traversal attacks and malicious input patterns targeting template inclusion vulnerabilities.
    *   Configure WAF rules to specifically monitor and filter requests containing path traversal sequences or attempts to access sensitive files.

#### 4.6 Detection and Monitoring

Detecting and monitoring for exploitation attempts is crucial for timely incident response.  Consider the following:

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:**  Analyze WAF logs for blocked requests that match path traversal patterns or attempts to access sensitive files. Look for patterns like `../`, `../../`, and attempts to access files like `/etc/passwd`, `.env` files, etc.
*   **Application Logs:**  Implement detailed logging within the application to record template inclusion attempts, including the template names requested and the resolved file paths. Monitor these logs for suspicious or unexpected path resolutions, especially those containing path traversal sequences or accessing unusual locations.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Utilize IDS/IPS systems to monitor network traffic for patterns associated with path traversal attacks and file inclusion attempts.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM to monitor critical system files and application configuration files for unauthorized access or modification. While not directly detecting the vulnerability, FIM can alert you if an attacker successfully exploits LFI to modify system files.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:**  Aggregate logs from WAF, application servers, IDS/IPS, and FIM into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and correlation of security events. Set up alerts to trigger on suspicious patterns related to file system access attempts.

#### 4.7 Conclusion

The "File System Access via `include` and `render` Tags" attack surface in Liquid-based applications presents a **High** severity risk due to the potential for significant information disclosure and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.  While Liquid itself is designed to be secure, misconfigurations and inadequate input validation in the application layer can easily introduce this vulnerability.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Application Responsibility:**  Securing Liquid template inclusion is primarily the responsibility of the application developer. Liquid provides the tools, but the application must use them securely.
