## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Liquid](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_liquid.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective through exploiting Liquid.
It's critical because it represents the overall security posture related to Liquid usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Liquid Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_liquid_code.md)

This node represents the core attack vector of inserting harmful code into Liquid templates or data processed by Liquid.
It's critical because successful injection can lead to direct code execution or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via User-Controlled Input](./attack_tree_paths/via_user-controlled_input.md)

This node highlights the risk of using unsanitized user input in Liquid templates.
It's critical because user input is a common and easily accessible attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject into Template Content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_into_template_content.md)

This node focuses on the direct injection of malicious code within the template markup itself.
It's critical because it bypasses many potential layers of defense if not handled correctly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Stored Templates](./attack_tree_paths/via_stored_templates.md)

This node represents the risk of attackers gaining control over the source of Liquid templates.
It's critical because compromised templates can lead to persistent and widespread attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Templates in Database/Filesystem](./attack_tree_paths/modify_templates_in_databasefilesystem.md)

This node specifically highlights the danger of unauthorized modification of template files or database entries.
It's critical because it allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be executed repeatedly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Custom Tag/Filter Implementations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_custom_tagfilter_implementations.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities introduced through custom Liquid extensions.
It's critical because custom code is often less scrutinized and can introduce significant security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject into Template Content -> Exploit Insecure Handling of User Input in Templates -> Inject Liquid Tags for Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/inject_into_template_content_-_exploit_insecure_handling_of_user_input_in_templates_-_inject_liquid__6964edd8.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid tags (e.g., using `assign` or custom tags) into user-controlled input that is then rendered by Liquid.
**Impact:** Server-side code execution, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
**Likelihood:** Medium (requires developer oversight in handling user input).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject into Template Content -> Exploit Insecure Handling of User Input in Templates -> Inject HTML/JavaScript via Liquid Output -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Liquid rendering](./attack_tree_paths/inject_into_template_content_-_exploit_insecure_handling_of_user_input_in_templates_-_inject_htmljav_466565fa.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code into user-controlled input that is rendered by Liquid without proper escaping.
**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover, or data theft.
**Likelihood:** High (common vulnerability if output encoding is not implemented).

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Stored Templates -> Modify Templates in Database/Filesystem -> Gain unauthorized write access to template storage](./attack_tree_paths/via_stored_templates_-_modify_templates_in_databasefilesystem_-_gain_unauthorized_write_access_to_te_96954121.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the storage location of Liquid templates (database or filesystem).
**Impact:** Full application compromise, as the attacker can inject any malicious code into the templates, which will be executed by the server. This can lead to data breaches, complete system control, and persistent backdoors.
**Likelihood:** Low (requires a prior compromise of the system or database).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Custom Tag/Filter Implementations -> Code Injection in Custom Logic -> If custom tags/filters execute code, inject malicious payloads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_custom_tagfilter_implementations_-_code_injection_in_custom_logic_-_if_custom_tagsf_6c0fe357.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the implementation of custom Liquid tags or filters that execute code, allowing them to inject and execute arbitrary code.
**Impact:** Server-side code execution, similar to the Liquid tag injection, allowing for full system compromise.
**Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the complexity and security of the custom code).
