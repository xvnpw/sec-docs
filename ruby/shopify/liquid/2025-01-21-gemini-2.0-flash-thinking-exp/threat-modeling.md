# Threat Model Analysis for shopify/liquid

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Liquid code into user-controlled input that is subsequently rendered by the Liquid engine. This could involve crafting input strings containing Liquid syntax (e.g., `{{ system.os.execute('malicious_command') }}`) that, when processed by Liquid's parsing and rendering mechanisms, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Template.parse`, `Context`, variable resolution, filter application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into Liquid templates.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before it reaches the Liquid engine.
        *   Utilize Liquid's built-in escaping mechanisms for user-provided data where it must be included in templates.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed Liquid environment with restricted access to potentially dangerous objects and methods.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unintended Variable Access](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unintended_variable_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft specific Liquid template structures or exploit the way Liquid resolves variables to access sensitive data that was not intended to be exposed in the template context. This could involve accessing properties of objects within the Liquid `Context` that contain sensitive information or exploiting error conditions within Liquid's rendering process that reveal internal data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of API keys, database credentials, internal application logic, personal user data, or other confidential information.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Context`, variable resolution, object access, error handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the variables and objects that are made available to the Liquid template context.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive data directly to the template context.
        *   Implement proper access control mechanisms within the application logic to restrict data available to Liquid.
        *   Customize error handling within the application to prevent the leakage of sensitive information in error messages generated by Liquid.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Checks through Liquid Logic Manipulation](./threats/bypassing_security_checks_through_liquid_logic_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the logic within Liquid templates to circumvent application-level security checks. If Liquid templates have access to objects or methods within the Liquid `Context` that control authentication or authorization, an attacker could potentially alter the template logic to bypass these checks and gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Context`, variable resolution, object method calls, custom tags.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the access Liquid templates have to security-sensitive application logic.
        *   Enforce security checks at the application level, independent of Liquid template rendering.
        *   Carefully audit the methods and properties exposed to the Liquid `Context`.
        *   Avoid exposing objects with direct control over security mechanisms to the template context.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/client-side_template_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** If Liquid is used for client-side rendering and user-controlled data is incorporated into templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious Liquid code that, when rendered by the Liquid engine in the user's browser, executes arbitrary JavaScript. This leverages Liquid's parsing and rendering capabilities on the client-side to inject and execute scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** `Template.parse`, `Context`, variable resolution, filter application (especially if used for output).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Liquid for client-side rendering with user-provided data if possible.
        *   Strictly sanitize and escape all user-provided data before incorporating it into client-side Liquid templates. Use appropriate escaping filters provided by Liquid or context-aware escaping mechanisms.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Liquid Tags](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_liquid_tags.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom Liquid tags, vulnerabilities in the implementation of these tags (which extend Liquid's functionality) could be exploited. This could involve issues like improper input handling within the custom tag's logic, insecure access to resources from within the tag, or logic flaws that allow for unintended actions when the tag is processed by the Liquid engine.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the functionality of the custom tag, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Liquid Component:** Custom tag implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the tag's functionality and vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Liquid tags.
        *   Thoroughly test custom tags for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within custom tag logic.
        *   Regularly review and update custom tag implementations.
