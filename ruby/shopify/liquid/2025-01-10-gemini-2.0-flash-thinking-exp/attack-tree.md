## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Liquid Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_liquid_code.md)

This path represents the attacker's goal of executing arbitrary code by injecting malicious code into Liquid templates.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Direct User Input in Templates (Critical Node):**
        *   An attacker identifies input points within the application where user-provided data is directly rendered using the Liquid templating engine without proper sanitization or escaping.
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious Liquid payload that, when rendered, executes arbitrary code on the server or performs other malicious actions.
        *   Examples of malicious payloads could involve accessing internal objects and methods that allow code execution (though Liquid's standard library is generally restricted, custom objects or misconfigurations could enable this) or manipulating data in unintended ways.
        *   The likelihood is medium due to the common mistake of directly rendering user input. The impact is high as it can lead to full application compromise. The effort and skill level are relatively low for basic injection attempts.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Liquid Tags/Filters (Critical Node):**
        *   The application utilizes custom Liquid tags or filters developed specifically for its functionality.
        *   An attacker identifies these custom components and analyzes their code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Common vulnerabilities include a lack of input validation, insecure API calls, or the execution of external commands based on user-controlled input.
        *   The attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by the vulnerable custom tag or filter, triggers the execution of arbitrary code.
        *   The likelihood is medium as custom code is often a source of vulnerabilities. The impact is high, similar to direct template injection. The effort to find vulnerabilities can be medium, requiring code analysis skills.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data via Liquid](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_via_liquid.md)

This path represents the attacker's goal of accessing sensitive data by exploiting Liquid's capabilities to access and output application data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Sensitive Application Variables (Critical Node):**
        *   The application exposes sensitive application variables directly within the Liquid context, making them accessible within templates.
        *   An attacker identifies these accessible variables, which could contain API keys, database credentials, user information, or other confidential data.
        *   The attacker crafts simple Liquid code to output the values of these sensitive variables, effectively exfiltrating the data.
        *   For example, an attacker might use `{{ settings.api_key }}` if the `settings` object containing the API key is exposed.
        *   The likelihood is medium, depending on developer practices. The impact can range from medium to high depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data. The effort and skill level are low.
