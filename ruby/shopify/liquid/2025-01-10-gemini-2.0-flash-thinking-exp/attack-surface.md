# Attack Surface Analysis for shopify/liquid

## Attack Surface: [Direct Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/direct_template_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious Liquid code directly into template strings that are processed by the Liquid engine.

**How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid's core functionality is to interpret and execute code within template strings. If these strings originate from untrusted sources, Liquid becomes the execution engine for malicious code.

**Example:** A website allows users to customize their profile with a "bio" field. If this bio is directly rendered as a Liquid template without sanitization, an attacker could input `{{ system.password }}` to attempt to access server-side information.

**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing attackers to read sensitive files, execute system commands, or compromise the entire application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly use user-provided input as Liquid templates.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization: Remove or escape any characters or patterns that could be interpreted as Liquid syntax.
*   Use a sandboxed Liquid environment: If available, configure Liquid to run with restricted access to system resources.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP):  While not directly preventing template injection, a strong CSP can limit the damage if malicious scripts are executed.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Template Injection via Data Sources](./attack_surfaces/indirect_template_injection_via_data_sources.md)

**Description:** Malicious Liquid code is injected into data sources (e.g., databases, configuration files) that are subsequently used in Liquid templates.

**How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid renders data fetched from various sources. If these sources are compromised and contain malicious Liquid syntax, the engine will execute it.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a database and modifies a product description to include `{{ 'rm -rf /' | shell_command }}`. When this product description is rendered on the website, the malicious command could be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Similar to direct template injection, this can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure data sources: Implement robust access controls and input validation on all data entry points that feed into Liquid templates.
*   Regular security audits: Scan databases and configuration files for potentially malicious content.
*   Treat all data as potentially untrusted: Even data from internal sources should be handled with care before being used in Liquid templates.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Object Access](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_object_access.md)

**Description:** Liquid's ability to access and render object properties can inadvertently expose sensitive information if not carefully controlled.

**How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid allows developers to access variables and object attributes within the template context. If the context contains sensitive data and is not properly filtered, this data can be exposed.

**Example:** A developer unintentionally passes a database connection object directly to the Liquid template context. An attacker could then use Liquid syntax like `{{ db_connection.password }}` to attempt to retrieve the database password.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, user information, or internal application configurations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Principle of least privilege for template context: Only pass the necessary data to the Liquid template. Avoid passing entire objects or data structures that contain sensitive information.
*   Careful review of template context: Regularly audit the data being passed to Liquid templates to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently included.
*   Use specific data transfer objects (DTOs): Create specific objects containing only the data needed for rendering, avoiding the exposure of unnecessary properties.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Liquid Tags and Filters](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_liquid_tags_and_filters.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in custom Liquid tags or filters can be exploited through carefully crafted Liquid code.

**How Liquid Contributes:** Liquid's extensibility allows developers to create custom tags and filters. If these extensions are not developed securely, they introduce new attack vectors.

**Example:** A custom filter designed to fetch external data might be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if it doesn't properly sanitize URLs passed to it: `{{ 'http://internal-service' | custom_fetch_data }}`.

**Impact:** Can range from information disclosure and SSRF to arbitrary code execution, depending on the vulnerability in the custom extension.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thorough security review and testing of custom tags and filters: Treat custom Liquid extensions as security-sensitive code.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions: Implement proper input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
*   Principle of least privilege for custom extensions: Limit the access and permissions granted to custom tags and filters.
*   Isolate custom extension execution: If possible, run custom extensions in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Inadequate Output Encoding](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_inadequate_output_encoding.md)

**Description:** If Liquid templates render user-provided data without proper encoding, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**How Liquid Contributes:** While Liquid provides auto-escaping by default, developers might disable it or use the `raw` filter inappropriately, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Example:** A user provides input like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` which is then rendered in a Liquid template using the `raw` filter without further sanitization. This script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rely on Liquid's default auto-escaping: Avoid disabling auto-escaping unless absolutely necessary.
*   Use appropriate escaping filters: When auto-escaping is disabled or the `raw` filter is used, explicitly use appropriate escaping filters like `escape` or `json` based on the context.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
*   Regular security scanning for XSS vulnerabilities.
