# Threat Model Analysis for shopify/liquid

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid code into a template that is then executed by the `Liquid::Template` component. This occurs when user-provided data is directly embedded into a Liquid template without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code within the server's environment.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting the application, including data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement to other systems.

**Affected Component:**
* `Liquid::Template` (when parsing and rendering untrusted input)
* `Liquid::Context` (if malicious code gains access to objects within the context)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat all user-provided data as untrusted.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into Liquid templates.
* Utilize a secure templating environment where possible, potentially with sandboxing or restricted access to objects.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful Liquid syntax before it reaches the template engine.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Template Logic Errors](./threats/information_disclosure_via_template_logic_errors.md)

**Description:** Poorly designed Liquid templates can unintentionally expose sensitive information through conditional logic, loops, or by accessing data objects within the `Liquid::Context` that should not be revealed to the current user. An attacker might craft specific inputs or navigate the application in a way that triggers the display of this sensitive information rendered by the `Liquid::Template`.

**Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, such as user details, internal system information, or API keys, potentially leading to identity theft, unauthorized access, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:**
* Specific Liquid templates containing the flawed logic.
* `Liquid::Context` (if it provides access to overly broad or unfiltered data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review template logic and the data exposed within templates.
* Implement the principle of least privilege when providing data to the template context, ensuring only necessary information is available.
* Conduct thorough testing of template rendering with various user roles and data scenarios.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Liquid Implementation or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_liquid_implementation_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the `shopify/liquid` library itself or its dependencies. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities within the core parsing or rendering logic of `Liquid::Template` or other internal components if they are not patched.

**Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:**
* Core `shopify/liquid` library components (e.g., parser, renderer within `Liquid::Template`).
* Dependencies used by the `shopify/liquid` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `shopify/liquid` library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Liquid and its dependencies.
* Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.
