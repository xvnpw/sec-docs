## 4. System Overview

Kamal is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the deployment of web applications to one or more remote servers. It achieves zero-downtime deployments by leveraging SSH for secure remote command execution and Docker for application containerization. The core deployment strategy involves creating and launching new application containers alongside existing ones, and then seamlessly switching network traffic to the new containers once they are healthy.

```

*   **Developer Machine:** The local workstation or development environment where the developer interacts with the Kamal CLI to initiate and manage deployments.
    *   **Kamal CLI:** The primary interface for interacting with Kamal. It parses the deployment configuration, establishes secure SSH connections, and orchestrates the deployment process on the target server(s).
    *   **Deployment Configuration (`deploy.yml`):** A YAML-formatted file that defines all the necessary parameters and instructions for deploying the application, including server details, Docker image specifications, environment variables, and load balancer configurations.
*   **SSH:** The Secure Shell protocol, providing an encrypted communication channel for the Kamal CLI to securely connect to and execute commands on the remote target server(s).
*   **Target Server(s):** The remote infrastructure (physical or virtual servers) where the application will be deployed and run.
    *   **Docker Daemon:** The background service on the target server responsible for building, running, managing, and orchestrating Docker containers. It receives instructions from the Kamal CLI via SSH.
    *   **Application Container (Old Version):** The currently active version of the web application running within a Docker container, serving live traffic.
    *   **Application Container (New Version):** The newly deployed version of the web application, also running within a Docker container. This container is started and verified before traffic is switched to it.
    *   **Traefik (or similar Load Balancer):** A reverse proxy and load balancer that intelligently routes incoming network traffic to the appropriate application container. Kamal often integrates with Traefik's dynamic configuration capabilities to facilitate seamless traffic switching during deployments.

    participant "Developer" as Dev
    participant "Kamal CLI" as Kamal
    participant "Target Server" as Server
    participant "Docker Daemon" as DockerD
    participant "Load Balancer" as LB

    Dev->>Kamal: Execute 'kamal deploy'
    Kamal->>Kamal: Read and Validate deploy.yml
    Kamal->>Server: SSH Connection
    Server->>DockerD: Command: docker pull <new_image>
    DockerD->>Docker Hub: Pull Image (if not present)
    DockerD->>Server: Image Pulled
    Server->>DockerD: Command: docker run <new_image>

    LB->>Application Container (New): Traffic Routed
    Kamal->>Server: Command: docker stop <old_container>
    Kamal->>Server: Command: docker rm <old_container>
```

1. **Developer initiates deployment:** A developer executes the `kamal deploy` command on their local machine.
2. **Kamal CLI processes configuration:** The Kamal CLI reads and validates the `deploy.yml` file to gather deployment instructions and parameters.
3. **Establish SSH connection:** The Kamal CLI establishes a secure SSH connection to the target server(s) specified in the configuration.
4. **Pull new Docker image:** The Kamal CLI instructs the Docker daemon on the target server to pull the specified new Docker image.
5. **Docker pulls image (if necessary):** The Docker daemon pulls the Docker image from the configured registry (e.g., Docker Hub) if it's not already present locally.
6. **Image pulled:** The Docker daemon confirms the successful download of the new image.
7. **Run new container:** The Kamal CLI instructs the Docker daemon to run a new container based on the newly pulled image, configuring it with the specified environment variables and port mappings.
8. **New container running:** The Docker daemon starts the new application container.
9. **Update load balancer routing:** The Kamal CLI interacts with the load balancer (e.g., via its API or configuration files) to update the routing rules, directing incoming traffic to the newly deployed container. This is the critical step for achieving zero-downtime deployment.
10. **Traffic routed to new container:** The load balancer begins routing new incoming requests to the newly launched application container.
11. **Stop old container:** After verifying the health and proper functioning of the new container, the Kamal CLI instructs the Docker daemon to stop the old application container.
12. **Remove old container:** Finally, the Kamal CLI instructs the Docker daemon to remove the stopped old application container, cleaning up resources.

## 6. Security Considerations (Detailed)

Building upon the initial assessment, here are more detailed security considerations for Kamal:

*   **SSH Key Management:**
    *   **Threat:** Compromised SSH private keys could grant unauthorized access to target servers, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands, modify configurations, or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Store SSH private keys securely with appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`).
        *   Avoid storing private keys in version control systems.
        *   Consider using SSH agents or key management tools to manage keys securely.
        *   Implement SSH certificate-based authentication for enhanced security and centralized key management.
        *   Regularly rotate SSH keys.
*   **Secrets Management in `deploy.yml`:**
    *   **Threat:** Storing sensitive information directly in `deploy.yml` exposes it to anyone with access to the file, including potential attackers.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Prefer using environment variables to inject secrets into containers at runtime.
        *   **Secrets Management Tools:** Integrate with dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
        *   **Configuration Encryption:** Explore encrypting sensitive sections of the `deploy.yml` file.
        *   **Avoid Committing Secrets:** Ensure `.gitignore` includes `deploy.yml` if it contains sensitive information, and avoid committing secrets directly to version control.
*   **Docker Image Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Docker images can be exploited to compromise the application or the underlying host system.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Regularly Scan Images:** Implement automated Docker image scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use Trusted Base Images:** Base application images on official or well-maintained and trusted base images.
        *   **Minimize Image Layers:** Reduce the number of layers in Docker images to decrease the attack surface.
        *   **Follow Docker Security Best Practices:** Adhere to Docker security best practices during image creation.
        *   **Implement Content Trust:** Use Docker Content Trust to ensure the integrity and authenticity of pulled images.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to target servers via SSH or other network protocols.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Disable Password Authentication:** Disable password-based SSH authentication and rely solely on SSH keys.
        *   **Use Strong Ciphers:** Configure SSH to use strong cryptographic ciphers.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the target servers, allowing only necessary ports and IP addresses.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to isolate the target servers from other less trusted networks.
*   **Load Balancer Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Misconfigured or vulnerable load balancers can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, disrupt service, or intercept traffic.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Follow security best practices for configuring the load balancer (e.g., disabling unnecessary features, setting strong authentication).
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the load balancer software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement access controls to restrict who can manage the load balancer configuration.
        *   **HTTPS/TLS:** Enforce HTTPS and properly configure TLS certificates.
*   **Access Control on Target Servers:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized users gaining access to the target servers or the Docker daemon.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to user accounts on the target servers.
        *   **Secure Docker Daemon Socket:** Restrict access to the Docker daemon socket.
        *   **Regularly Review User Accounts:** Periodically review and remove unnecessary user accounts.
*   **Supply Chain Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Compromised dependencies or tools used by Kamal could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Kamal's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use Trusted Sources:** Obtain Kamal and its dependencies from trusted sources.
        *   **Verify Signatures:** Verify the signatures of downloaded packages.
*   **Configuration Management Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized modification or access to the `deploy.yml` configuration file.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the `deploy.yml` file to authorized personnel.
        *   **Version Control:** Store `deploy.yml` in a version control system with appropriate access controls and audit logging.

## 7. Deployment

Kamal is deployed by installing the Ruby gem on the developer's local machine or within a CI/CD environment. No specific server-side installation of Kamal is required, as it operates by remotely executing commands via SSH.

*   **Installation:** Install the Kamal gem using `gem install kamal`.
*   **Configuration:** Create a `deploy.yml` file in the root of the application repository.
*   **Execution:** Run Kamal commands from the command line within the application repository.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Advanced Monitoring and Logging:** Built-in capabilities for monitoring deployment status, application health, and logging deployment activities.
*   **Support for More Deployment Strategies:** Expanding support for deployment strategies beyond basic rolling updates, such as blue/green deployments without solely relying on load balancer switching, and canary deployments.
*   **Improved Error Handling and Rollback Mechanisms:** More robust error handling and more granular control over rollback procedures.
*   **GUI or Web Interface:**  Consideration of a graphical user interface or web interface for managing deployments.
*   **Integration with Orchestration Tools:** Potential integration with other orchestration tools like Kubernetes for more complex deployments.
*   **Plugin System:**  Developing a plugin system to extend Kamal's functionality and support different infrastructure providers or deployment scenarios.
