**Threat Model: Octopress Application - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes**

**Objective:** Compromise application using Octopress by exploiting its weaknesses.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

*   **Compromise Application Using Octopress Weaknesses (AND)**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Octopress Core (OR)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Jekyll Vulnerabilities (OR)**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Arbitrary Code Execution via YAML Parsing (e.g., in _config.yml)**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Compromise via Malicious Plugins or Themes (OR)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Install Backdoored Plugin**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies (OR)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruby Version**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gems (Jekyll, etc.)**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise the Build Environment (OR)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise the Server Running the Build Process**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Developer Workstation**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Octopress Core:**
    *   Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in Jekyll itself, the core of Octopress.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Jekyll Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Octopress is built on Jekyll. Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in Jekyll itself.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Arbitrary Code Execution via YAML Parsing (e.g., in _config.yml):**
    *   Jekyll uses YAML for configuration. If not handled securely, attackers can inject malicious YAML code in files like `_config.yml` that gets executed during the build process.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Compromise via Malicious Plugins or Themes:**
    *   Octopress allows the use of plugins and themes to extend functionality and customize appearance.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Install Backdoored Plugin:**
    *   An attacker could trick an administrator into installing a plugin that contains malicious code designed to compromise the application or server. This could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting malicious plugins on seemingly legitimate platforms.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins:**
    *   Third-party plugins might contain known or zero-day vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies:**
    *   Octopress relies on various dependencies.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruby Version:**
    *   Known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Ruby used by Octopress could be exploited.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gems (Jekyll, etc.):**
    *   Octopress depends on Ruby gems like Jekyll. Vulnerabilities in these gems can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise the Build Environment:**
    *   The environment where the Octopress site is built is a critical point of attack.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise the Server Running the Build Process:**
    *   If the server where the `octopress generate` command is executed is compromised, an attacker can inject malicious code during the build process, affecting the generated website.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Developer Workstation:**
    *   If a developer's machine is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the Octopress project before it's deployed.
