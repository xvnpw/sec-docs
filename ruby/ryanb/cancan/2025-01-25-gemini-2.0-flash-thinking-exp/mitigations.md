## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Abilities (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_abilities__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege in Abilities (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `Ability` class:** Examine your `Ability` class (`app/models/ability.rb`) where CanCan abilities are defined.
    2.  **Identify broad CanCan permissions:** Pinpoint CanCan ability definitions that use overly broad actions like `:manage` or target `:all` resources without specific conditions.
    3.  **Refine CanCan abilities:**  For each broad CanCan ability, analyze the necessary permissions for different roles. Replace `:manage, :all` with specific actions and resource types relevant to each role within CanCan's `can` definitions.
    4.  **Implement CanCan conditions:** Utilize CanCan's conditional blocks within `can` definitions to further restrict access based on resource attributes or user context, making abilities more granular within CanCan.
    5.  **Regular CanCan ability audit:** Schedule periodic reviews of your `Ability` class to ensure CanCan permissions remain aligned with application needs and security policies. Remove any unnecessary CanCan abilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via CanCan (High Severity):** Broad CanCan permissions can grant unintended access to resources or actions, leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications *due to misconfigured CanCan abilities*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through CanCan (Medium Severity):** Overly permissive CanCan roles can be exploited to gain higher privileges than intended *because of flawed CanCan ability definitions*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via CanCan (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting CanCan access to only what is strictly necessary, enforced through CanCan's ability definitions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through CanCan (Medium Reduction):** Makes privilege escalation harder by limiting the initial set of CanCan permissions available to users, controlled by CanCan's ability logic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have roles and some resource-specific CanCan abilities, but Admin role still uses broad `:manage, :all` in CanCan. Implemented in `app/models/ability.rb`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Refine Admin role CanCan abilities to be more granular. Review and refine CanCan abilities for less used features to ensure least privilege is applied consistently within CanCan definitions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Ability Definitions (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/granular_ability_definitions__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Granular Ability Definitions (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze CanCan actions:** For each resource protected by CanCan, identify specific actions users can perform (beyond CRUD, like `publish`, `approve`) and map them to CanCan abilities.
    2.  **Avoid CanCan `:manage` shortcut:**  In CanCan, instead of using `:manage`, explicitly define each action for each resource in your `Ability` class.
    3.  **Define specific CanCan action abilities:** Create CanCan abilities for each identified action, like `can :create_post, Post`, `can :edit_title_post, Post`, `can :publish_post, Post` within your `Ability` class.
    4.  **Use custom CanCan actions:** Define custom actions in your controllers and corresponding CanCan abilities to represent specific operations beyond standard CRUD, ensuring CanCan covers all authorization needs.
    5.  **Test granular CanCan abilities:** Ensure your tests specifically cover each granular CanCan ability to verify they function as intended within the CanCan framework.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Modification via CanCan (Medium Severity):** Granular CanCan definitions prevent users from modifying data they should only view, *due to precise control within CanCan*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to CanCan (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data corruption by limiting modification permissions through granular CanCan abilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Modification via CanCan (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by making unintended modifications harder to perform *due to CanCan's fine-grained control*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to CanCan (Medium Reduction):** Contributes to data integrity by controlling modification access more precisely through CanCan.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. For core resources, we use granular CRUD actions in CanCan. Less critical resources still rely on `:manage` in CanCan. Implemented in `app/models/ability.rb`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Extend granular CanCan definitions to all resources, especially custom actions. Refactor existing `:manage` CanCan abilities to use specific actions where possible within the `Ability` class.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Abilities (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_abilities__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Context-Aware Abilities (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify CanCan context-dependent authorization:** Determine scenarios where CanCan authorization depends on factors beyond user role and resource type (e.g., resource ownership, group membership), requiring context within CanCan abilities.
    2.  **Use CanCan blocks in `can` definitions:** Implement context-aware logic within `can` blocks in your `Ability` class, leveraging CanCan's block feature.
    3.  **Access user and resource attributes in CanCan:** Within CanCan blocks, access `user` and `resource` objects to implement conditional logic based on their attributes, utilizing CanCan's context.
    4.  **Utilize application state in CanCan:** If necessary, access other application state within CanCan blocks to make authorization decisions based on dynamic factors, extending CanCan's context.
    5.  **Test context-aware CanCan abilities:** Write unit tests that specifically cover different contexts and ensure CanCan ability logic behaves correctly in each scenario, validating CanCan's context handling.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Circumvention of Business Logic via CanCan (Medium Severity):** Without context-awareness in CanCan, authorization might not align with complex business rules, leading to bypasses *within CanCan's authorization framework*.
    *   **Data Leakage due to CanCan Context (Low to Medium Severity):** In certain contexts, lack of context-aware CanCan authorization could lead to unintended data exposure *due to limitations in CanCan's contextual awareness*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Circumvention of Business Logic via CanCan (Medium Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing CanCan authorization based on complex business rules, leveraging CanCan's contextual capabilities.
    *   **Data Leakage due to CanCan Context (Low to Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk in scenarios where context is crucial for preventing data exposure, addressed by CanCan's context-aware abilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Resource ownership checks are implemented using CanCan blocks. Context-awareness for group membership is implemented in some CanCan areas. Implemented in `app/models/ability.rb`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Extend CanCan context-awareness to cover more complex business rules, such as time-based restrictions or group-based permissions across all relevant features within CanCan.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear and Explicit Ability Logic (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/clear_and_explicit_ability_logic__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Clear and Explicit Ability Logic (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Simplify complex CanCan logic:** Refactor overly complex or nested CanCan ability definitions in your `Ability` class to improve readability and maintainability of your CanCan rules.
    2.  **Avoid implicit CanCan logic:** Make CanCan authorization logic explicit and easy to understand. Avoid relying on implicit assumptions or side effects within your CanCan abilities.
    3.  **Use meaningful CanCan action names:** Choose action names in your CanCan abilities that clearly describe the permission being granted (e.g., `manage_comments` instead of just `manage` in CanCan).
    4.  **Document complex CanCan abilities:** Add comments to explain the reasoning behind complex CanCan ability definitions, especially those using blocks or custom logic within your `Ability` class.
    5.  **Code reviews for CanCan abilities:** Include CanCan ability definitions in code reviews to ensure clarity and identify potential ambiguities or errors in your CanCan authorization rules.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration of CanCan (Medium Severity):** Complex or unclear CanCan logic increases the risk of misconfiguration, leading to unintended permissions or bypasses *due to errors in CanCan ability definitions*.
    *   **Maintenance Issues with CanCan (Low Severity):** Difficult-to-understand CanCan logic makes it harder to maintain and update abilities, potentially leading to security regressions in CanCan over time.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration of CanCan (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by making it easier to understand and verify the correctness of CanCan ability definitions.
    *   **Maintenance Issues with CanCan (Low Reduction):** Improves maintainability of CanCan rules and reduces the risk of introducing security issues during updates to CanCan abilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews include basic CanCan ability checks, and some comments exist in `Ability` class. Implemented in code review process and `app/models/ability.rb`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a stronger focus on clarity during code reviews specifically for CanCan ability definitions. Proactively refactor complex CanCan abilities and add comprehensive documentation for all non-trivial CanCan logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Unit Testing for Abilities (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/unit_testing_for_abilities__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Unit Testing for Abilities (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create CanCan ability unit tests:** Develop a dedicated test suite specifically for your `Ability` class, focusing on CanCan ability logic (e.g., using RSpec in Rails).
    2.  **Test each CanCan ability:** Write tests for each defined CanCan ability, covering different user roles and scenarios relevant to CanCan authorization.
    3.  **Test positive and negative CanCan cases:** For each CanCan ability, test both cases where access should be granted and cases where access should be denied by CanCan.
    4.  **Test CanCan edge cases:** Include tests for edge cases and boundary conditions in your CanCan abilities to identify potential vulnerabilities in complex CanCan logic.
    5.  **Run CanCan tests in CI/CD:** Integrate CanCan ability unit tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure they are run automatically with every code change affecting CanCan abilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authorization Bugs in CanCan Abilities (High Severity):** Bugs in CanCan ability definitions can lead to critical authorization bypasses, allowing unauthorized access or actions *due to flaws in CanCan logic*.
    *   **Regression Bugs in CanCan Abilities (Medium Severity):** Changes to CanCan ability definitions or related code can unintentionally introduce new authorization bugs within CanCan.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authorization Bugs in CanCan Abilities (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and preventing authorization bugs in CanCan abilities before they reach production.
    *   **Regression Bugs in CanCan Abilities (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of regressions by automatically verifying CanCan ability logic with every code change.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. We have a unit test suite for the `Ability` class using RSpec, covering core CanCan abilities. Tests are run in CI/CD. Implemented in `spec/models/ability_spec.rb` and CI/CD configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Expand test coverage to include all CanCan abilities, especially newly added or modified ones. Improve edge case testing for complex CanCan abilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Integration Testing for Authorization (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/integration_testing_for_authorization__cancan_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Integration Testing for Authorization (CanCan Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Write CanCan integration tests:** Create integration tests that simulate user interactions and API requests to verify CanCan authorization in controllers and views.
    2.  **Test CanCan controller actions:** Use integration testing frameworks to test controller actions with different user roles and permissions, specifically focusing on CanCan enforcement.
    3.  **Verify CanCan enforcement:** Assert that `authorize!` and `load_and_authorize_resource` are correctly applied and enforce the defined CanCan abilities in controllers and views.
    4.  **Test CanCan view authorization:** If views conditionally render content based on CanCan authorization, include tests to verify this behavior.
    5.  **Run CanCan integration tests in CI/CD:** Integrate CanCan authorization integration tests into your CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Missing CanCan Authorization Checks (High Severity):** Integration tests can detect cases where `authorize!` or `load_and_authorize_resource` are missing in controllers, leading to complete CanCan authorization bypasses.
    *   **Incorrect CanCan Authorization Enforcement (Medium Severity):** Tests can identify situations where CanCan authorization is applied incorrectly, leading to unintended access or denial *due to misuse of CanCan methods*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Missing CanCan Authorization Checks (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring CanCan authorization checks are consistently applied in controllers.
    *   **Incorrect CanCan Authorization Enforcement (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by verifying that CanCan authorization is enforced correctly in the application flow.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have some integration tests for core controller actions, but CanCan authorization coverage is not comprehensive. Tests are run in CI/CD. Implemented in `spec/requests` and `spec/system` directories and CI/CD configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Expand integration test coverage to all controllers and critical views, ensuring comprehensive CanCan authorization testing across the application. Focus on testing different user roles and permission levels in CanCan integration tests.

    *   **Unintended Access due to CanCan Misuse (High Reduction):** Directly reduces the risk of unintended access by preventing authorization bypasses caused by CanCan misuse.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic developer training and code review processes, but specific guidelines for CanCan usage are not formally documented. Implemented through developer onboarding and code review process.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalize CanCan usage guidelines in our development documentation. Implement specific code review checklists for CanCan authorization. Explore static analysis tools for CanCan usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Bypassing CanCan Authorization Checks](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_bypassing_cancan_authorization_checks.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Bypassing CanCan Authorization Checks
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strict code review for CanCan bypasses:** Emphasize in code reviews the importance of not bypassing CanCan authorization checks. Look for any code that might circumvent `authorize!` or `load_and_authorize_resource` in CanCan contexts.
    2.  **Avoid conditional CanCan bypasses:** Discourage the use of conditional logic that bypasses CanCan authorization checks based on user roles or other factors unless absolutely necessary and extremely well-justified within CanCan contexts.
    3.  **Centralized CanCan authorization logic:** Keep CanCan authorization logic centralized in the `Ability` class and avoid scattering CanCan authorization decisions throughout the application code.
    4.  **Security audits for CanCan bypasses:** Conduct periodic security audits to specifically look for potential CanCan authorization bypasses in the codebase.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Intentional CanCan Authorization Bypass (High Severity):** Malicious actors or developers might intentionally try to bypass CanCan authorization checks to gain unauthorized access *despite CanCan being in place*.
    *   **Accidental CanCan Authorization Bypass (Medium Severity):** Developers might unintentionally introduce code that bypasses CanCan authorization checks due to errors or misunderstandings of CanCan.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Intentional CanCan Authorization Bypass (High Reduction):** Reduces the risk by making it harder to intentionally bypass CanCan authorization through code review and security audits.
    *   **Accidental CanCan Authorization Bypass (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by promoting secure coding practices and centralized CanCan authorization logic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews generally look for security issues, but specific focus on CanCan authorization bypasses could be strengthened. Security audits are conducted annually but may not deeply focus on CanCan specifically. Implemented through code review process and annual security audits.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enhance code review guidelines to specifically address CanCan authorization bypass prevention. Incorporate CanCan authorization bypass checks into security audit scope.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Consideration of `cannot` Definitions (CanCan Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_consideration_of__cannot__definitions__cancan_specific_.md)
