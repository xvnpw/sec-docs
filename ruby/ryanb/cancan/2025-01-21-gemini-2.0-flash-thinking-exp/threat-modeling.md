# Threat Model Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Ability Definition](./threats/overly_permissive_ability_definition.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to resources or actions if the `can` definitions in the `Ability` class are too broad. This might happen due to missing conditions or using overly general conditions that inadvertently grant access to unintended users or roles. For example, a rule might allow any user with a specific role to manage *all* resources of a certain type, even when it should be restricted to resources they own or are specifically assigned.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Privilege escalation, where a user gains access to functionalities beyond their intended scope.

**Affected CanCan Component:** `Ability` class (specifically the `can` method and its conditions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement granular and specific conditions in `can` definitions.
*   Thoroughly review and test all ability definitions, especially when dealing with complex permissions.
*   Use specific resource attributes in conditions whenever possible (e.g., `can :manage, Article, user_id: user.id`).
*   Employ the principle of least privilege when defining abilities.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Ability Conditions](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_ability_conditions.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit flaws in custom block conditions used within `can` definitions. If the logic within these blocks contains errors or overlooks certain edge cases, it could lead to unintended authorization outcomes. For instance, a condition checking if a user is a member of a specific group might have a flaw that allows users who are not members to pass the check.

**Impact:** Circumvention of authorization checks, leading to unauthorized access or actions.

**Affected CanCan Component:** `Ability` class (specifically the block conditions within the `can` method).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly test custom block conditions with various inputs and edge cases.
*   Use clear and concise logic within these blocks.
*   Consider extracting complex logic into separate, well-tested methods or service objects.
*   Utilize unit tests to verify the behavior of custom ability conditions.
