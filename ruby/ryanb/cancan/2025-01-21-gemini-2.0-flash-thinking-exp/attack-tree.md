## Attack Tree Path: [A. Bypass Authorization Checks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/a__bypass_authorization_checks__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching goal of an attacker targeting CanCan. If an attacker can bypass authorization checks, they can gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they are not permitted to. This node is critical because it represents the failure of the entire authorization mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [A.1. Incorrect Ability Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/a_1__incorrect_ability_definitions__critical_node_.md)

*   The `Ability` class is the core of CanCan's authorization logic. Mistakes in defining abilities directly lead to vulnerabilities. This node is critical because it's where permissions are established, and flaws here cascade into exploitable weaknesses.

    *   **A.1.a. Overly Permissive Rules [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   A common mistake is defining rules that grant too much access. For example, using `can :manage, :all` in production or granting `manage` to a broad user role when it should be more specific.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly review the `Ability` class, especially after adding new features or roles. Adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Likelihood:** High, **Impact:** High, **Effort:** Low, **Skill Level:** Low, **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [A.1.a. Overly Permissive Rules [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/a_1_a__overly_permissive_rules__high_risk_path_.md)

*   A common mistake is defining rules that grant too much access. For example, using `can :manage, :all` in production or granting `manage` to a broad user role when it should be more specific.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly review the `Ability` class, especially after adding new features or roles. Adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Likelihood:** High, **Impact:** High, **Effort:** Low, **Skill Level:** Low, **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [A.2. Missing or Incorrect `authorize!` Calls [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/a_2__missing_or_incorrect__authorize!__calls__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   Even with correctly defined abilities, failing to enforce them in controllers renders the authorization useless. This node is critical because it represents the point of enforcement, and its failure directly leads to bypassed security. It's also a high-risk path because forgetting authorization checks is a common and impactful error.

    *   **A.2.a. Forgetting `authorize!` in Controller Actions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Developers might forget to call `authorize!` before performing an action that requires authorization.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement code reviews and consider using linters or static analysis tools to ensure `authorize!` is present in all relevant controller actions. Consider using `load_and_authorize_resource` for simpler resource loading and authorization.
        *   **Likelihood:** High, **Impact:** High, **Effort:** Low, **Skill Level:** Low, **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [A.2.a. Forgetting `authorize!` in Controller Actions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/a_2_a__forgetting__authorize!__in_controller_actions__high_risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [A.3. Exploiting Implicit Assumptions](./attack_tree_paths/a_3__exploiting_implicit_assumptions.md)

*   CanCan relies on developers to correctly define abilities based on the application's data model and logic. Incorrect assumptions can lead to vulnerabilities.

    *   **A.3.b. Relying on View Logic for Security [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Hiding elements in the view based on `can?` is not a security measure. Authorization must be enforced at the controller level to prevent unauthorized actions.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Always enforce authorization in the controller actions. View logic should only control presentation, not access. An attacker can bypass view restrictions by directly sending requests.
        *   **Likelihood:** High, **Impact:** Medium, **Effort:** Low, **Skill Level:** Low, **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [A.3.b. Relying on View Logic for Security [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/a_3_b__relying_on_view_logic_for_security__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Hiding elements in the view based on `can?` is not a security measure. Authorization must be enforced at the controller level to prevent unauthorized actions.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Always enforce authorization in the controller actions. View logic should only control presentation, not access. An attacker can bypass view restrictions by directly sending requests.
