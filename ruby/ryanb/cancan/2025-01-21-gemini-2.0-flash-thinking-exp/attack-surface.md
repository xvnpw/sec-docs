# Attack Surface Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Ability Definitions](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_ability_definitions.md)

*   **How CanCan Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CanCan's core functionality revolves around defining abilities. If these definitions are too broad or contain logical errors, they can grant unintended access, directly stemming from how CanCan rules are structured.
    *   **Example:** Defining `can :manage, User` for a role that should only be able to view user profiles, allowing them to delete or modify any user account.
    *   **Impact:** Users can perform actions they are not intended to, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define abilities with the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit ability definitions to ensure they accurately reflect intended access controls.
        *   Use specific resource and action definitions instead of broad categories like `:manage, :all` or `:manage, User` when more granular control is needed.
        *   Employ conditional logic within abilities carefully and test thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences.

## Attack Surface: [Missing Authorization Checks in Controllers](./attack_surfaces/missing_authorization_checks_in_controllers.md)

*   **How CanCan Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Developers must explicitly use CanCan's methods (`authorize!`, `can?`) to enforce authorization. Forgetting to include these checks in controller actions means CanCan's authorization logic is bypassed entirely for those actions.
    *   **Example:** A controller action that transfers funds between accounts does not call `authorize! :transfer, @account`, allowing any authenticated user to potentially transfer funds.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can access and manipulate resources or perform actions they should not be able to, potentially leading to significant financial loss or data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all controller actions that handle sensitive operations or access protected resources include explicit CanCan checks using `authorize!` or `can?`.
        *   Utilize `load_and_authorize_resource` where applicable to automate the loading and authorization of resources, reducing the chance of forgetting authorization checks.
        *   Implement mandatory code review processes with a focus on verifying the presence and correctness of CanCan authorization checks.
        *   Consider using linters or static analysis tools configured to identify potential missing authorization calls in controller actions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Filtering Based on Abilities](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_filtering_based_on_abilities.md)

*   **How CanCan Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While CanCan handles *whether* a user is authorized, it's the developer's responsibility to use that information to filter data queries. Failing to do so, or doing it incorrectly, means CanCan's authorization doesn't translate to secure data access.
    *   **Example:** An index action for "sensitive reports" checks if a user `can? :read, SensitiveReport`, but the underlying database query fetches all sensitive reports without filtering based on the user's specific abilities or associated data.
    *   **Impact:** Users can access sensitive data they are not authorized to view, leading to confidentiality breaches and potential regulatory violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Consistently integrate CanCan's `accessible_by` scope into database queries to automatically filter results based on the current user's defined abilities.
        *   Avoid fetching more data than necessary and ensure data filtering is performed at the database level, not just in the application logic or view.
        *   Thoroughly test data access patterns and queries to verify that they correctly respect user abilities and prevent unauthorized data access.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities with `load_and_authorize_resource`](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_with__load_and_authorize_resource_.md)

*   **How CanCan Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The convenience method `load_and_authorize_resource` automatically loads and authorizes resources based on request parameters. If strong parameters are not properly configured, attackers can manipulate request parameters to modify attributes they shouldn't have access to, bypassing CanCan's intended authorization.
    *   **Example:** A user can modify the `is_admin` attribute of their own user object by including it in the parameters of an update request, if strong parameters do not explicitly prevent this and the ability definition is not restrictive enough.
    *   **Impact:** Users can modify sensitive attributes, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly use strong parameters in controllers to explicitly permit only the attributes that are intended to be modifiable through user input.
        *   Carefully define abilities to restrict which attributes can be updated for specific resources, even if they are permitted by strong parameters.
        *   Avoid relying solely on `load_and_authorize_resource` without implementing robust parameter filtering and ability definitions. Consider explicitly authorizing attribute updates within the controller action for critical attributes.
