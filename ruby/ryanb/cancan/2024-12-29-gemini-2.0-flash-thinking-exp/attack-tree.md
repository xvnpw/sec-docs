## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in CanCan Authorization

**Objective:** Gain unauthorized access or perform actions beyond their intended privileges within the application by exploiting weaknesses in the CanCan authorization library.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application Authorization via CanCan [CRITICAL]
    *   Bypass Authorization Checks [CRITICAL]
        *   Exploit Incorrect Ability Definition [CRITICAL]
            *   Overly Permissive Abilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Granting `manage` to unintended roles/resources
            *   Missing Ability Definitions ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Critical actions lack authorization checks
        *   Circumvent `can?` Method Usage [CRITICAL] ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
            *   Direct Access to Controller Actions without `can?` Check
                *   Developers forget to implement authorization checks
        *   Exploit `load_and_authorize_resource` Vulnerabilities
            *   Parameter Tampering in Resource Loading ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Manipulating request parameters to load unintended resources
            *   Authorization Scope Issues ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   `load_and_authorize_resource` not properly scoping resources to the current user
        *   Exploit Conditional Ability Logic
            *   Data Manipulation to Satisfy Conditions ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Altering data to meet the criteria of an overly broad conditional ability
        *   Role/Permission Data Manipulation (Indirectly via CanCan) [CRITICAL] ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
            *   Compromise User Role Assignment Mechanism
                *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the system that manages user roles, leading to elevated privileges that CanCan then respects.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application Authorization via CanCan:** This represents the ultimate goal of an attacker targeting the application's authorization mechanism. Success at this node means the attacker has bypassed CanCan's protections and can perform unauthorized actions.

*   **Bypass Authorization Checks:** This node signifies the core objective of circumventing CanCan's intended authorization mechanisms. A successful attack here means the attacker has found a way to bypass the checks designed to prevent unauthorized access.

*   **Exploit Incorrect Ability Definition:** This critical node highlights vulnerabilities arising from errors in how developers define authorization rules within CanCan's `Ability` class. Incorrect definitions can lead to unintended permissions or a lack of protection for critical actions.

*   **Circumvent `can?` Method Usage:** This node focuses on attacks that bypass the primary mechanism for checking authorization in CanCan. If an attacker can circumvent the `can?` method, they can potentially execute actions without proper authorization.

*   **Role/Permission Data Manipulation (Indirectly via CanCan):** This critical node represents a scenario where the attacker targets the underlying system responsible for managing user roles and permissions. Compromising this system can effectively bypass CanCan's checks, as CanCan relies on this data for authorization decisions.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Overly Permissive Abilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers incorrectly grant broad permissions, such as `manage`, to roles that should have more restricted access.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers with these roles can perform any action on the specified resources, potentially leading to data breaches, modifications, or deletion.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, as it's a common configuration error.

*   **Missing Ability Definitions:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to define specific authorization rules for critical actions.
    *   **Impact:** If no explicit ability is defined, CanCan defaults to denial. However, if developers assume this implicit denial is sufficient without proper planning, vulnerabilities can arise if new actions are added without corresponding ability definitions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low, but the impact on unprotected critical actions is high.

*   **Direct Access to Controller Actions without `can?` Check:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers forget to implement the `can?` method or its equivalent before executing sensitive actions within controllers.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can directly access and execute these actions without any authorization checks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, as it's a common oversight during development.

*   **Parameter Tampering in Resource Loading:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate request parameters (e.g., IDs) to influence the resource loading process within `load_and_authorize_resource`, potentially gaining access to resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can access or manipulate resources belonging to other users or resources they are not authorized to interact with.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, as it's a relatively straightforward attack if input validation is weak.

*   **Authorization Scope Issues:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The `load_and_authorize_resource` method is not configured to properly scope resources to the current user.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can access or manipulate resources belonging to other users because the authorization check doesn't correctly limit the scope of accessible resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, as developers might overlook proper scoping.

*   **Data Manipulation to Satisfy Conditions:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate data (e.g., request parameters, database records) to meet the conditions defined in conditional ability blocks, even if they shouldn't have access under normal circumstances.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass intended restrictions by manipulating the data used in authorization checks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on the complexity and breadth of the conditional logic.

*   **Role/Permission Data Manipulation (Indirectly via CanCan):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the system responsible for assigning user roles or directly tamper with the storage mechanism for roles and permissions (e.g., the database).
    *   **Impact:** By gaining elevated privileges or modifying their roles, attackers can bypass CanCan's authorization checks, as CanCan relies on this role information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low, as it targets a separate system, but the impact on CanCan's effectiveness is very high.
