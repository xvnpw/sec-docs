## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Ability Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_ability_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Errors in the `Ability` class, which defines user permissions, are the root cause of many CanCan vulnerabilities. This is a *critical* node because it's the foundation of the authorization system.
*   **Likelihood:** High/Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/High

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Permissive Rules](./attack_tree_paths/overly_permissive_rules.md)

*   **Description:** Rules that grant broader access than intended, often due to a misunderstanding of CanCan's syntax or a lack of careful consideration.
*   **Example:** `can :manage, :all` grants complete control over *all* resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Review and replace `can :manage, :all` with specific permissions.
    *   Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews of the `Ability` class.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Wildcards Incorrectly](./attack_tree_paths/using_wildcards_incorrectly.md)

*   **Description:** Misunderstanding or misusing wildcards like `:all`, `:read`, etc., leading to unintended access grants.
*   **Example:** `can :read, :all` grants read access to *every* resource, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Define permissions explicitly for each resource.
    *   Avoid relying heavily on broad wildcards.
    *   Document the intended behavior of each rule.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Ability Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_ability_checks.md)

*   **Description:** Even with correctly defined abilities, failing to *enforce* them renders the authorization system useless. This is a *critical* node.
*   **Likelihood:** High/Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Ability Checks](./attack_tree_paths/missing_ability_checks.md)

*   **Description:** The most common bypass: forgetting to use `load_and_authorize_resource` (or `authorize!`) in controllers, leaving actions completely unprotected.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Enforce the use of `load_and_authorize_resource` in all controllers.
            *   Use linters or code analysis tools to detect missing checks.
            *   Apply `load_and_authorize_resource` at the controller level.

## Attack Tree Path: [No `load_and_authorize_resource`](./attack_tree_paths/no__load_and_authorize_resource_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Controller Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/controller_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Intentionally or accidentally disabling authorization checks for specific actions using `skip_before_action :authorize!` or `skip_authorize_resource`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Minimize and strictly review any use of `skip_before_action :authorize!` and `skip_authorize_resource`.
            *   Require code review approval for any skipping of authorization.
