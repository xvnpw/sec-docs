# Deep Analysis: Bypassing `accessible_by` in CanCan

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the risks, implications, and mitigation strategies associated with developers bypassing CanCan's `accessible_by` method when constructing database queries.  We aim to provide actionable guidance to the development team to prevent this vulnerability.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface created when developers:

*   Understand the existence and purpose of `accessible_by`.
*   Choose *not* to use `accessible_by` for retrieving collections of resources.
*   Instead, write custom database queries (e.g., using ActiveRecord's `where`, `find_by_sql`, or similar methods) that do *not* incorporate the authorization logic defined in the `Ability` class.
*   The application uses ActiveRecord with CanCan. Other ORMs might have slightly different implications, but the core principle remains the same.

This analysis *excludes* scenarios where:

*   `accessible_by` is used correctly.
*   Authorization is bypassed through other means (e.g., manipulating user roles directly in the database).
*   The application is not using ActiveRecord.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Detailed Risk Assessment:**  Expand on the initial risk assessment, providing concrete examples and scenarios.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:** Explain *how* `accessible_by` works internally and why bypassing it is dangerous.
3.  **Code Examples:** Illustrate both vulnerable and secure code snippets.
4.  **Advanced Mitigation Strategies:** Go beyond the basic mitigations, exploring more robust and preventative measures.
5.  **Testing Strategies:**  Outline how to specifically test for this vulnerability.
6.  **Monitoring and Logging:**  Suggest ways to detect potential bypass attempts in a production environment.

## 2. Detailed Risk Assessment

The "Bypassing `accessible_by`" vulnerability poses a **high** risk because it directly undermines the core security mechanism of CanCan.  It leads to unauthorized data disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive information to users who should not have access.

**Specific Scenarios:**

*   **Financial Data:** A user might be able to view financial records of other users or the company itself by manipulating parameters in a custom query.
*   **Private Messages:**  A user could access private messages between other users by crafting a query that ignores the intended recipient restrictions.
*   **Administrative Data:**  A non-admin user might gain access to administrative dashboards or data by bypassing access controls enforced by `accessible_by`.
*   **Confidential Documents:**  Users could view or download confidential documents they are not authorized to access.
*   **GDPR/CCPA Violations:**  Unauthorized access to personal data can lead to severe legal and financial penalties under regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

**Impact Beyond Data Disclosure:**

*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches erode user trust and can significantly damage the application's reputation.
*   **Legal Liability:**  The organization could face lawsuits and fines for failing to protect user data.
*   **Business Disruption:**  Remediating the vulnerability and dealing with the aftermath of a breach can be time-consuming and costly.

## 3. Technical Deep Dive: How `accessible_by` Works

CanCan's `accessible_by` method is not just a simple wrapper; it's a crucial component of its security model.  Here's how it works:

1.  **Ability Definition:**  You define authorization rules in your `Ability` class using `can` and `cannot` statements.  These rules specify which actions (e.g., `:read`, `:create`, `:update`, `:destroy`) a user can perform on which resources (e.g., `Article`, `Comment`, `User`).  These rules can include conditions (blocks) that further refine access based on attributes of the resource or the user.

2.  **`accessible_by` Call:** When you call `Article.accessible_by(current_ability)`, CanCan does the following:

    *   **Inspects Abilities:** It examines the `Ability` instance (`current_ability`) to determine the rules that apply to the `Article` model and the `:read` action (by default, `accessible_by` checks for read access).
    *   **Translates to SQL (ActiveRecord):**  Crucially, CanCan *translates* these rules into SQL `WHERE` clauses.  For example, if your `Ability` class has:

        ```ruby
        can :read, Article, published: true
        can :read, Article, user_id: user.id
        ```

        `accessible_by` might generate a query like:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM articles WHERE (articles.published = TRUE) OR (articles.user_id = 123)
        ```
        (where `123` is the current user's ID).

    *   **Returns an ActiveRecord::Relation:**  The result is an `ActiveRecord::Relation` object, *not* an array of results.  This is important because it allows you to chain further query methods (e.g., `.order`, `.limit`, `.includes`) *without* losing the authorization scoping.

3.  **Bypassing the Mechanism:** When a developer writes a custom query, they are *completely bypassing* this translation process.  They are responsible for manually implementing the authorization logic in their SQL, which is error-prone and difficult to maintain.  Even a small mistake can lead to a significant security vulnerability.

## 4. Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code (BAD):**

```ruby
# In a controller
def index
  # Bypassing accessible_by - HUGE SECURITY RISK!
  if current_user.admin?
    @articles = Article.all
  else
    @articles = Article.where(published: true) # Only shows published, misses user-specific articles!
  end
end
```

This code is vulnerable because it doesn't consider *all* the rules defined in the `Ability` class.  For example, it might miss rules that allow users to see their *own* unpublished articles.

**Secure Code (GOOD):**

```ruby
# In a controller
def index
  @articles = Article.accessible_by(current_ability)
end
```

This code is secure because it uses `accessible_by` to automatically scope the query based on *all* applicable authorization rules.

**Slightly More Complex Example (GOOD):**

```ruby
# In a controller
def index
  @articles = Article.accessible_by(current_ability).where("title LIKE ?", "%#{params[:query]}%")
end
```
This is also secure. The additional `where` clause is *chained* onto the `ActiveRecord::Relation` returned by `accessible_by`, so the authorization scoping is preserved.

## 5. Advanced Mitigation Strategies

Beyond the basic mitigations, consider these more robust approaches:

*   **RuboCop/Static Analysis:** Use a custom RuboCop rule (or a similar static analysis tool) to *automatically* detect and flag any database queries that retrieve collections of resources without using `accessible_by`.  This is the most proactive and reliable approach.  Example (conceptual RuboCop rule):

    ```ruby
    # (Conceptual - requires implementation)
    # In a custom RuboCop cop:
    class NoBypassingAccessibleBy < RuboCop::Cop::Cop
      MSG = 'Use `accessible_by` to retrieve collections of resources.'

      def_node_matcher :model_query, <<-PATTERN
        (send (const nil? :ModelName) ${:where :all :find_by_sql ...})
      PATTERN

      def on_send(node)
        model_query(node) do |method|
          # Check if the method is called within a controller action
          # and if it's operating on a model that has CanCan abilities.
          if in_controller_action?(node) && model_has_abilities?(node)
            add_offense(node, message: MSG)
          end
        end
      end

      # (Helper methods to determine context and model abilities)
      # ...
    end
    ```

*   **Query Builder Pattern:** For complex queries, create a dedicated query builder class that encapsulates the query logic *and* uses `accessible_by` as its foundation.  This promotes code reuse and ensures that authorization is always considered.

    ```ruby
    class ArticleQueryBuilder
      def initialize(ability)
        @ability = ability
        @relation = Article.accessible_by(ability)
      end

      def with_title_containing(query)
        @relation = @relation.where("title LIKE ?", "%#{query}%")
        self
      end

      def published
        @relation = @relation.where(published: true)
        self
      end

      def build
        @relation
      end
    end

    # In the controller:
    @articles = ArticleQueryBuilder.new(current_ability).with_title_containing(params[:query]).published.build
    ```

*   **Database Views (with caution):**  In *very specific* scenarios, you could consider using database views to pre-filter data based on authorization rules.  However, this approach is complex, can be difficult to manage, and may not be suitable for all situations.  It also requires careful consideration of database performance and security implications.  This should be a last resort.

*   **Centralized Authorization Logic:**  Ensure that *all* authorization logic is defined in the `Ability` class.  Avoid scattering authorization checks throughout your controllers or models.

## 6. Testing Strategies

Testing is crucial to ensure that `accessible_by` is used correctly and that no unauthorized data is exposed.

*   **Unit Tests for `Ability`:**  Thoroughly test your `Ability` class to ensure that all rules are correctly defined and behave as expected.  Create different user roles and scenarios to cover all possible access combinations.

*   **Integration Tests:**  Create integration tests that simulate different user roles and access different parts of the application.  Specifically, test scenarios where users *should* and *should not* be able to access certain data.  Verify that the correct data is returned in each case.

*   **Test Custom Queries:**  If you *must* use custom queries (despite the strong recommendation against it), create specific tests to verify that they correctly implement the authorization logic.  These tests should be very thorough and cover all possible edge cases.

*   **Automated Security Scans:**  Consider using automated security scanning tools that can detect common vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access.

* **Specific `accessible_by` bypass test:**
    ```ruby
    # Example using RSpec and FactoryBot
    require 'rails_helper'

    RSpec.describe ArticlesController, type: :controller do
      describe "GET #index" do
        let(:user) { create(:user) } # Regular user
        let(:admin) { create(:admin) } # Admin user
        let!(:public_article) { create(:article, published: true) }
        let!(:private_article) { create(:article, published: false, user: user) }
        let!(:other_private_article) { create(:article, published: false) }

        context "as a regular user" do
          before { sign_in user }

          it "returns only accessible articles" do
            get :index
            expect(assigns(:articles)).to include(public_article)
            expect(assigns(:articles)).to include(private_article)
            expect(assigns(:articles)).not_to include(other_private_article)
          end
        end

        context "as an admin user" do
          before { sign_in admin }

          it "returns all articles" do
            get :index
            expect(assigns(:articles)).to include(public_article)
            expect(assigns(:articles)).to include(private_article)
            expect(assigns(:articles)).to include(other_private_article)
          end
        end

        # Add a test to specifically check if accessible_by is being bypassed
        it "does not bypass accessible_by" do
          # This is a bit of a hack, but it can help detect if someone
          # is directly querying the database without using accessible_by.
          allow(Article).to receive(:accessible_by).and_call_original
          expect(Article).to receive(:accessible_by)
          get :index
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

*   **Log Query Parameters:**  Log the parameters used in database queries, especially those that might be used to bypass authorization (e.g., user IDs, resource IDs).  This can help identify suspicious activity.

*   **Audit Trail:**  Implement an audit trail to track all data access, including who accessed what data and when.  This can be useful for investigating potential breaches.

*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use monitoring tools to detect unusual patterns of data access, such as a sudden increase in the number of records accessed by a particular user.

*   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators of any suspicious activity, such as failed authorization attempts or access to sensitive data.

## Conclusion

Bypassing `accessible_by` in CanCan is a serious security vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized data disclosure. By understanding how `accessible_by` works, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and thoroughly testing your application, you can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability and protect your users' data. The most effective approach is to combine strong coding practices (enforcing `accessible_by` usage), static analysis (RuboCop), and comprehensive testing.
