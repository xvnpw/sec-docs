# Attack Surface Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Attack Surface: [1. Overly Permissive Authorization Rules](./attack_surfaces/1__overly_permissive_authorization_rules.md)

*   **Description:**  Rules defined in the `Ability` class grant broader access than intended, allowing users to perform actions they should not be authorized to do. This is the core vulnerability related to CanCan misuse.
*   **How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan's declarative rule system, while powerful, can be misused to create overly broad permissions if not carefully designed and reviewed.  The flexibility of the `can :manage, :all` syntax and complex conditions can lead to errors.  This is *inherent* to how CanCan operates.
*   **Example:**  A rule intended for administrators (`can :manage, User`) is accidentally applied to all logged-in users due to a missing condition or a typo in the role check.  Or, `can :read, Article, published: true` might have a flaw in how `published` is determined, leading to unauthorized access to draft articles.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.  Privilege escalation, allowing regular users to perform administrative actions.  Complete system compromise in extreme cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Start by denying all access (`cannot :manage, :all`).  Explicitly grant *only* the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Granular Rules:**  Define highly specific rules.  Avoid broad `can :manage` statements. Use specific actions (e.g., `:create`, `:read`, `:update`, `:destroy`).
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require at least two experienced developers to review *every* change to the `Ability` class.
    *   **Comprehensive Test Suite:**  Develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests targeting authorization. Test positive and negative cases for *every* rule and condition.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the authorization logic.
    *   **Use `cannot` for Default Deny:**  Explicitly use `cannot` to deny actions, creating a "default deny" approach.

## Attack Surface: [2. Flawed Condition Logic](./attack_surfaces/2__flawed_condition_logic.md)

*   **Description:**  Conditions within `can` blocks (e.g., `can :update, Article, user_id: user.id`) contain errors, leading to incorrect authorization decisions. This directly relates to how CanCan evaluates conditions.
*   **How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan allows for complex conditions, including Ruby code and database queries *within its authorization logic*.  This flexibility increases the risk of introducing logic errors or vulnerabilities *within the CanCan rules themselves*.
*   **Example:**  A condition checking for ownership (`user_id: user.id`) might be bypassed if the `user_id` field can be manipulated.  A condition relying on a complex SQL query might have an injection vulnerability (if not using parameterized queries).
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to resources, potentially allowing users to modify or delete data they don't own.  Bypass of intended authorization restrictions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Simplify Conditions:**  Keep conditions as simple as possible.  Avoid complex logic or nested conditions.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Always* validate and sanitize data used *within* CanCan conditions.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (or ORM Equivalent):**  *Always* use parameterized queries (or the ORM equivalent) for database queries *within* CanCan conditions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Conditions:**  Test conditions with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and invalid data.
    *   **Avoid Direct Use of `params`:** Minimize direct use of `params` within conditions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Missing Authorization Checks](./attack_surfaces/3__missing_authorization_checks.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers forget to use `load_and_authorize_resource` (or `authorize_resource`) in controller actions, bypassing CanCan's checks entirely. This is a direct failure to utilize CanCan's core functionality.
*   **How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan relies on developers to *explicitly* invoke authorization checks using its provided methods.  Omitting these calls means CanCan is *not* being used for authorization, which is a direct misuse of the gem.
*   **Example:**  A controller action that directly accesses the database without calling `load_and_authorize_resource` will not have any CanCan authorization applied.
*   **Impact:**  Complete bypass of authorization, allowing unauthorized users to access and modify any data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Consistent Usage:**  Require `load_and_authorize_resource` (or `authorize_resource`) in *every* controller action requiring authorization.
    *   **Automated Checks:**  Use static analysis tools or linters to detect missing authorization checks.
    *   **Controller-Level `check_authorization`:**  Use `check_authorization` in your `ApplicationController` to raise an exception if authorization is not checked.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Code reviews should *always* check for the presence of authorization checks.
    *   **Training and Awareness:** Ensure all developers are thoroughly trained on CanCan.

## Attack Surface: [4. Bypassing `accessible_by`](./attack_surfaces/4__bypassing__accessible_by_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers construct custom database queries instead of using CanCan's `accessible_by` method, circumventing CanCan's query scoping and potentially exposing unauthorized data. This is a direct avoidance of a key CanCan security feature.
*   **How CanCan Contributes:** `accessible_by` is a core CanCan feature designed to *automatically* scope queries based on the defined authorization rules.  Bypassing it *directly* undermines CanCan's security model.
*   **Example:** Instead of `@articles = Article.accessible_by(current_ability)`, a developer writes a custom query that doesn't respect the authorization rules.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data disclosure. Users might view data they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce `accessible_by` Usage:**  Mandate or strongly encourage the use of `accessible_by` for all queries retrieving collections of resources.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Flag any custom queries that might bypass authorization.
    *   **Training:**  Ensure developers understand the purpose and importance of `accessible_by`.
    * **Alternative Query Builders:** If complex queries are needed, consider using a dedicated query builder class that still uses `accessible_by` as its foundation.
