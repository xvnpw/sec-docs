# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Test Suite for Ability Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_test_suite_for_ability_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a dedicated test file:** Create a file specifically for testing abilities (e.g., `spec/models/ability_spec.rb` in RSpec).
    2.  **Define test contexts:** Structure tests using contexts for different user roles (e.g., "admin," "user," "guest").
    3.  **Test positive cases:** For each role and resource, write tests that assert the user *can* perform actions they are allowed to. Use `expect(ability).to be_able_to(:action, resource)`.
    4.  **Test negative cases:** For each role and resource, write tests that assert the user *cannot* perform actions they are *not* allowed to. Use `expect(ability).not_to be_able_to(:action, resource)`.
    5.  **Test edge cases:** Include tests for boundary conditions (e.g., empty resources, nil values, invalid IDs), and unusual scenarios.
    6.  **Test different user attributes:** If abilities depend on user attributes (e.g., `project.user_id == user.id`), test with different attribute values.
    7.  **Integrate with CI/CD:** Run these tests automatically as part of your continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline.
    8.  **Regularly update tests:** As new features are added or authorization rules change, update the tests accordingly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Ability Definitions (Logic Errors):** (Severity: **High**) - Incorrect `can` and `cannot` rules granting unintended access.  This is the *core* threat CanCan addresses, and testing is the primary defense.
    *   **Overly Broad Permissions:** (Severity: **High**) - Using `:manage, :all` too liberally. Testing helps reveal when this is happening.
    *   **Typos in Ability Definitions:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Misspelled model or attribute names. Tests using `be_able_to` will fail if the model or attribute doesn't exist.
    *   **Confusing `can` and `cannot`:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Incorrectly using `cannot` instead of `can` with a negated condition.  Positive and negative tests expose this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incorrect Ability Definitions:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Overly Broad Permissions:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).
    *   **Typos:** Risk reduced significantly (90%).
    *   **Confusing `can` and `cannot`:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `spec/models/ability_spec.rb` exists and contains basic tests for admin and user roles.
    *   Tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Tests for guest users are incomplete.
    *   Edge case testing is limited.
    *   Tests for specific user attributes (beyond role) are missing.
    *   Negative tests are not comprehensive for all actions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Authorization Checks in Controllers (using CanCan methods)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_authorization_checks_in_controllers__using_cancan_methods_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `load_and_authorize_resource`:**  This is a *CanCan-specific* method.  Use it as the default in controllers to automatically load the resource *and* authorize it based on the `Ability` class.
    2.  **Handle `CanCan::AccessDenied`:** Implement a global exception handler to catch this *CanCan-specific* exception.  This ensures consistent handling of authorization failures.
    3.  **Manual `authorize!` (when necessary):** If `load_and_authorize_resource` is not suitable, use the *CanCan-specific* `authorize! :action, @resource` method.
    4.  **Code Review Checklist:** Include "authorization checks present (using CanCan methods)" as a mandatory item.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypassing CanCan Checks:** (Severity: **High**) - Developers forgetting to use CanCan's authorization methods (`authorize!` or `load_and_authorize_resource`).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypassing CanCan Checks:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `load_and_authorize_resource` is used in most controllers.
    *   `CanCan::AccessDenied` is handled globally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some older controllers still use manual `authorize!` calls (need to be refactored to use `load_and_authorize_resource` where possible).
    *   Code review checklist item is not consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional Rendering in Views (using `can?`)](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_rendering_in_views__using__can__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `can?` for UI elements:**  This is a *CanCan-specific* method.  Wrap UI elements with `can? :action, @resource` checks.  This prevents rendering elements the user cannot access.
    2.  **Avoid disabling elements:**  Completely remove unauthorized elements; don't just disable them.
    3.  **Test view rendering:** Verify UI elements are correctly rendered (or not) based on user abilities defined in CanCan.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Ability Leakage (Information Disclosure):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Exposing information about a user's abilities through the UI (by showing elements they can't use).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Ability Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `can?` is used in most views.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some older views may still disable elements.
    *   View tests specifically checking for `can?` usage are limited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Judicious Use of `accessible_by` (and Analysis)](./mitigation_strategies/judicious_use_of__accessible_by___and_analysis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer `authorize!` and `can?`:** For simple checks, use these *CanCan-specific* methods.
    2.  **Use `accessible_by` for scoping queries:** Only use this *CanCan-specific* method when you need to retrieve a set of records based on abilities defined in the `Ability` class.
    3.  **Analyze generated SQL:** Examine the SQL queries generated by `accessible_by` to ensure efficiency and prevent data leakage.  This is crucial because `accessible_by` directly interacts with the database based on CanCan's rules.
    4.  **Consider alternatives:** If `accessible_by` leads to complex queries, consider fetching more data and filtering in Ruby (using `can?` on individual objects, if needed).
    5. **Document usage:** If using `accessible_by`, clearly document the reason and the expected behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Issues with `accessible_by`:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Inefficient queries.
    *   **Data Leakage with `accessible_by`:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Exposing unintended data.  This is directly related to how CanCan translates abilities into database queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Issues:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `accessible_by` is used in a few places.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal guidelines for when to use `accessible_by`.
    *   Generated SQL is not routinely analyzed.
    *   Documentation is limited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews Focused on CanCan Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_focused_on_cancan_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated Reviewer:** Assign a developer familiar with CanCan to review authorization logic.
    2.  **Checklist:** Include items specifically related to CanCan:
        *   Presence of `authorize!` or `load_and_authorize_resource`.
        *   Correctness of `can` and `cannot` rules.
        *   Use of `can?` in views.
        *   Appropriate use of `accessible_by`.
        *   No bypassing of CanCan's checks.
    3.  **Focus on Logic:** Understand the *intended* access control model and how CanCan is used to implement it.
    4.  **Scenario Walkthrough:** Walk through user scenarios to ensure CanCan rules behave as expected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Ability Definitions (Logic Errors):** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Bypassing CanCan Checks:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Ability Leakage:** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Overly Broad Permissions:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **All other CanCan-related threats:** (Severity: **Medium to High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk reduced significantly (60-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code reviews are mandatory.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No dedicated reviewer for CanCan logic.
    *   No specific checklist items for CanCan.
    *   Scenario walkthroughs are not consistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits of the `Ability` Class](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_of_the__ability__class.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule:** Conduct regular audits of the `Ability` class (the core of CanCan).
    2.  **Independent Reviewer:** Ideally, have someone *not* directly involved in development perform the audit.
    3.  **Focus on Changes:** Review changes made to the `Ability` class since the last audit.
    4.  **Re-evaluate Existing Rules:** Re-evaluate *all* existing CanCan rules.
    5.  **Document Findings:** Document any vulnerabilities or areas for improvement.
    6.  **Prioritize Remediation:** Address identified issues promptly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Ability Definitions (Logic Errors):** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Overly Broad Permissions:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **All other CanCan-related threats:** (Severity: **Medium to High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal process for regular audits of the `Ability` class.
