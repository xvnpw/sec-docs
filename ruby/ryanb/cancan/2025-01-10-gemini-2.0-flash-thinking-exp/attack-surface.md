# Attack Surface Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Defined Abilities](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_defined_abilities.md)

**Description:** Authorization rules (`can` definitions) are defined too broadly, granting unintended access to resources or actions.

**How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan's flexibility in defining abilities, through conditions and block logic, directly enables this vulnerability when configurations are overly permissive or lack sufficient constraints.

**Example:**

*   `can :manage, Article` without any conditions, allowing any user to perform all actions on any article.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify or delete critical information, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Define abilities with the narrowest scope possible, granting only the necessary permissions.
*   **Utilize Resource-Based Authorization:**  Employ conditions within `can` definitions to check attributes of the resource being accessed (e.g., `can :update, Article, user_id: user.id`).
*   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review and audit CanCan ability definitions to ensure they accurately reflect intended access control and haven't become overly permissive.

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Incorrect Authorization Enforcement](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_incorrect_authorization_enforcement.md)

**Description:**  Authorization checks using CanCan's provided methods (`authorize!` or `can?`) are missing in critical parts of the application or used incorrectly, allowing actions to be performed without proper validation.

**How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan provides the mechanisms for authorization, but the responsibility of implementing these checks correctly lies with the developer. Failure to use `authorize!` appropriately creates a direct vulnerability.

**Example:**

*   A controller action to delete a user does not include `authorize! @user, :destroy`, allowing any authenticated user to potentially delete other users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, deletion, or creation; privilege escalation if unauthorized actions impact higher-level functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Mandatory `authorize!` in Controllers:** Enforce the use of `authorize!` in all controller actions that handle data modification or sensitive operations.
*   **Careful `can?` Usage in Views:** Ensure `can?` checks in views accurately reflect the authorization status and don't lead to UI elements being exposed when the underlying action is unauthorized.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests that specifically verify CanCan authorization rules are enforced correctly across different user roles and scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure through `accessible_by`](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_through__accessible_by_.md)

**Description:**  Using CanCan's `accessible_by` method with overly broad or insecurely defined `read` abilities can inadvertently expose sensitive data when querying resources.

**How CanCan Contributes:** `accessible_by` directly leverages the defined CanCan abilities to filter database queries. If the `read` ability is too permissive, `accessible_by` will expose more data than intended.

**Example:**

*   `can :read, User` is defined broadly. Using `User.accessible_by(current_ability)` could expose sensitive user details (like email addresses or personal information) to users who should only have limited access.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive or confidential information to unauthorized users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Restrictive `read` Abilities:** Define `read` abilities with specific conditions to limit access to only necessary attributes and resources.
*   **Contextual `accessible_by`:**  Use `accessible_by` with caution and ensure the `current_ability` reflects the intended access level for the specific query.
*   **Consider Alternative Querying:** For sensitive data access, consider building more explicit database queries with specific conditions instead of solely relying on `accessible_by`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Ability Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_ability_logic.md)

**Description:** Errors or vulnerabilities within the custom block logic used in CanCan's `can` definitions can introduce security flaws that bypass intended authorization.

**How CanCan Contributes:** CanCan allows developers to implement complex authorization logic within blocks, but the security of this logic depends entirely on the developer's implementation.

**Example:**

*   A custom ability block that relies on unsanitized user input to determine access, making it susceptible to injection attacks.
*   Logical flaws in the custom block that inadvertently grant access under specific, unintended conditions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, potential data manipulation, or privilege escalation depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply secure coding principles when writing custom ability logic, including input validation and sanitization.
*   **Thorough Testing of Custom Logic:**  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically targeting the custom ability blocks to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Reviews for Custom Abilities:**  Ensure custom ability logic is reviewed by other developers to identify potential flaws or security weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in CanCan](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_cancan.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of the CanCan library itself exposes the application to known security flaws within the library's code.

**How CanCan Contributes:** The vulnerability resides directly within the CanCan library's codebase.

**Example:**

*   A known vulnerability in an older version of CanCan that allows bypassing authorization checks under specific circumstances.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure and unauthorized access to more severe issues like remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Regularly Update CanCan:** Keep the CanCan library updated to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Utilize a dependency management tool (like Bundler in Ruby) to track and manage CanCan's version and dependencies.
*   **Security Scanning of Dependencies:**  Employ security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including CanCan.
