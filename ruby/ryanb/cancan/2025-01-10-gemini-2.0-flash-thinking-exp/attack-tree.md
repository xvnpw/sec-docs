## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via CanCan Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cancan_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Successful exploitation of any vulnerability within CanCan's authorization framework, leading to the attacker achieving their objective.
- Risk: Represents a complete failure of the application's authorization mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authorization Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authorization_checks__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Any method used to circumvent CanCan's intended access controls, allowing unauthorized actions.
- Risk: Broad category encompassing various vulnerabilities that directly undermine CanCan's purpose.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Authorization Checks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/missing_authorization_checks__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Failure to implement `authorize!` or `can?` checks in critical parts of the application.
- Risk: Direct access to sensitive functionalities without any authorization enforcement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unprotected Controller Actions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/unprotected_controller_actions__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Accessing controller actions that modify data or perform sensitive operations without CanCan's protection.
- Risk: Allows attackers to directly trigger privileged actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Permissive Abilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/overly_permissive_abilities__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Defining `can` rules that grant more access than intended.
- Risk: Unintentional granting of broad privileges, easily exploitable by standard users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering to Bypass Authorization (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering_to_bypass_authorization__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Modifying request parameters to manipulate authorization checks.
- Risk: Common web application vulnerability directly applicable to CanCan.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating Resource IDs (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_resource_ids__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Changing resource identifiers in requests to access or modify unauthorized data.
- Risk: Simple yet effective way to bypass authorization based on resource ownership.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Integration with Authentication System (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_integration_with_authentication_system__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Flaws in how CanCan interacts with the authentication system, leading to incorrect user identification.
- Risk: Authorization decisions are based on incorrect user context, potentially granting access to anyone.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Directly modifying database records related to authorization (e.g., roles, permissions).
- Risk: Complete circumvention of CanCan's logic by altering the underlying data it relies on.
