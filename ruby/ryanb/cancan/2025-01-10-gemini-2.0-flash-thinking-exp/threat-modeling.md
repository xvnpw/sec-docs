# Threat Model Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Ability Definition](./threats/overly_permissive_ability_definition.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they should not be able to. This occurs when developers define abilities in `ability.rb` that are too broad or have insufficient constraints *within CanCan's `can` method*. For example, an ability might grant `:manage` permission to all resources of a certain type without proper scoping *in the CanCan definition*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Privilege escalation, where a user gains access to functionalities reserved for higher-level roles due to a flaw *in CanCan's ability definition*.

**Affected CanCan Component:** `ability.rb` (specifically the `can` method and the conditions defined within it).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining abilities *within CanCan's `ability.rb`*.
*   Use specific actions and resource constraints in `can` definitions.
*   Thoroughly test ability definitions with different user roles and scenarios.
*   Regularly review and audit `ability.rb` for overly permissive rules.

## Threat: [Missing Authorization Checks (`authorize!` calls)](./threats/missing_authorization_checks___authorize!__calls_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could directly access actions or resources by bypassing CanCan's authorization checks. This occurs when developers forget to include the `authorize!` method *provided by CanCan* in controller actions that require authorization.

**Impact:** Complete bypass of access control for the affected actions, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation, creation, or deletion *because CanCan's enforcement mechanism is absent*.

**Affected CanCan Component:** Controller actions where the `authorize!` method *from CanCan* should be present but is missing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a consistent pattern for using CanCan's `authorize!` method in controllers.
*   Use code linters or static analysis tools to identify missing `authorize!` calls.
*   Implement integration tests that cover authorized access to various controller actions, ensuring CanCan's authorization flow is tested.
*   Perform thorough code reviews to ensure all necessary authorization checks *using CanCan* are in place.

## Threat: [Reliance on User-Controlled Data in Ability Definitions](./threats/reliance_on_user-controlled_data_in_ability_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-controlled data that is directly used within CanCan's ability definitions to gain unauthorized access. For example, if an ability checks if a resource's `owner_id` matches the current user's ID, and this comparison is done directly against potentially tainted user input *within the CanCan ability definition*.

**Impact:** Circumvention of CanCan's authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access and potential data manipulation *due to a flaw in how CanCan's rules are defined*.

**Affected CanCan Component:** `ability.rb` where ability definitions directly use user-controlled data *within the `can` method's conditions*.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly using user-controlled data in CanCan's ability definitions if possible.
*   If user-controlled data is necessary, ensure it is rigorously validated and sanitized *before* being used in CanCan's authorization logic.
*   Implement additional checks and safeguards to prevent manipulation of the data used in CanCan's authorization decisions.
