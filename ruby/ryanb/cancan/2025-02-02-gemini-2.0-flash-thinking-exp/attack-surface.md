# Attack Surface Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect or Insufficient Ability Definitions in `ability.rb`](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_or_insufficient_ability_definitions_in__ability_rb_.md)

*   **Description:** Logic errors or overly permissive rules in `ability.rb` grant unintended access.
*   **CanCan Contribution:** `ability.rb` is the core of CanCan's authorization, misconfigurations directly lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Defining `can :manage, User` for a "Moderator" role unintentionally allows moderators to manage *all* user accounts, including administrators.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, full administrative compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:** Mandatory peer review of all `ability.rb` changes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Granular Permissions:** Use specific actions and conditions instead of broad `:manage`.
    *   **Comprehensive Authorization Testing:** Implement extensive tests covering all ability definitions, including negative test cases to verify restrictions.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Authorization Checks in Controllers due to Missing or Incorrect `authorize!` Calls](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_authorization_checks_in_controllers_due_to_missing_or_incorrect__authorize!__calls.md)

*   **Description:**  Forgetting or incorrectly using `authorize!` in controllers, leaving actions unprotected.
*   **CanCan Contribution:** CanCan relies on explicit `authorize!` calls for enforcement; omissions bypass authorization.
*   **Example:**  `authorize!` is missed in the `Admin::UsersController#destroy` action, allowing unauthorized users to delete administrator accounts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, data deletion, privilege escalation, potential application takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Code Analysis:** Use linters to detect missing `authorize!` calls.
    *   **Controller Action Templates:** Ensure controller generation templates include `authorize!` by default.
    *   **Mandatory Integration Tests:**  Write tests specifically verifying `authorize!` is present and functioning correctly in all relevant controller actions.
    *   **Base Controller with `before_action`:** Enforce authorization checks using a base controller or `before_action` filters to minimize omissions.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on User-Provided Data in Ability Definitions without Proper Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_user-provided_data_in_ability_definitions_without_proper_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:** Using unsanitized user input in `ability.rb` conditions, allowing manipulation to bypass authorization.
*   **CanCan Contribution:** CanCan's flexible conditions can be misused if developers directly use untrusted user data.
*   **Example:** Ability definition checks `user.department == params[:department]`, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `department` parameter to gain access to resources outside their actual department.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, access to sensitive resources, data breaches, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User Input in Abilities:**  Refrain from directly using request parameters or client-side data in `ability.rb`.
    *   **Server-Side Validation and Lookup:** Validate user input against trusted server-side sources (database, session) before using in ability conditions.
    *   **Parameter Allowlisting and Sanitization:** If user input is unavoidable, strictly allowlist expected values and sanitize thoroughly.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in CanCan Gem Itself (Dependency Risk)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_cancan_gem_itself__dependency_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the CanCan gem code that could be exploited.
*   **CanCan Contribution:**  Using CanCan introduces dependency risk; vulnerabilities in CanCan directly impact the application.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in CanCan's core permission checking logic allows attackers to bypass all authorization checks regardless of `ability.rb`.
*   **Impact:** Complete authorization bypass, full system compromise, data breaches, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update CanCan:** Keep CanCan gem updated to the latest stable version for security patches.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Monitoring:** Use tools to monitor for known vulnerabilities in CanCan and dependencies.
    *   **Security Advisory Subscription:** Subscribe to security advisories for Ruby on Rails and related gems to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rapid Patch Deployment:** Establish a process for quickly applying security patches to dependencies when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
