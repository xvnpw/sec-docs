# Threat Model Analysis for ryanb/cancan

## Threat: [Missing CanCan Authorization Checks in Controllers](./threats/missing_cancan_authorization_checks_in_controllers.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker directly accesses controller actions that lack `authorize!` or `load_and_authorize_resource`. They can manipulate requests to trigger these unprotected actions, bypassing intended authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, deletion, or access to sensitive information. Potential data breach and system compromise.
*   **CanCan Component Affected:** Controller integration (specifically the absence of `authorize!` and `load_and_authorize_resource` calls).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mandatory code reviews focusing on authorization checks in controllers.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools or linters to detect missing `authorize!` calls.
    *   Establish coding standards requiring authorization checks for all relevant controller actions.
    *   Implement integration tests to verify authorization enforcement for all controller actions.
    *   Consider using a base controller to enforce default authorization, requiring explicit opt-out for public actions.

## Threat: [Incorrectly Defined Abilities](./threats/incorrectly_defined_abilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits flaws in the logic of `ability.rb` definitions. They identify overly permissive rules or incorrect conditions that grant them unintended access or actions. They then craft requests to leverage these loopholes.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing users to perform actions beyond their intended roles. Data breaches due to unauthorized access and manipulation.
*   **CanCan Component Affected:** `ability.rb` (Ability definition logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct thorough reviews and testing of ability definitions, especially complex conditions.
    *   Write unit tests specifically for ability definitions, covering various user roles and scenarios (positive and negative cases).
    *   Use clear and specific conditions in ability rules, avoiding overly generic rules.
    *   Regularly audit and update ability definitions as application features and user roles evolve.

## Threat: [Bypassing CanCan Checks through Direct Database Manipulation](./threats/bypassing_cancan_checks_through_direct_database_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker identifies and exploits application components that directly interact with the database without going through CanCan-protected controllers (e.g., background jobs, custom scripts, API endpoints with flawed authorization). They can then manipulate data directly, bypassing CanCan's intended authorization.
*   **Impact:** Complete bypass of authorization, allowing attackers to directly manipulate data regardless of CanCan rules. Data integrity compromise and potential system takeover.
*   **CanCan Component Affected:** Application integration (failure to consistently apply CanCan across all data access points).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all data access points, including background jobs, APIs, and custom queries, are integrated with CanCan or a similar authorization mechanism.
    *   Minimize or eliminate direct database manipulation outside of the application's intended access paths.
    *   Conduct security audits to identify potential bypasses outside of standard controller actions.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Default Abilities](./threats/overly_permissive_default_abilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker benefits from overly broad default abilities defined in `ability.rb` (e.g., starting with `can :manage, :all`). They exploit these defaults to gain unintended permissions, even if specific restrictions are intended later but are insufficient or flawed.
*   **Impact:** Unintentional privilege escalation, allowing regular users to perform administrative actions or access sensitive data. System compromise and data breaches.
*   **CanCan Component Affected:** `ability.rb` (Default ability definitions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adopt the principle of least privilege when defining abilities. Start with restrictive defaults and explicitly grant permissions as needed.
    *   Avoid using `can :manage, :all` as a starting point unless absolutely necessary and immediately followed by robust and well-tested `cannot` rules.
    *   Regularly review default ability definitions to ensure they remain appropriate as the application evolves.
