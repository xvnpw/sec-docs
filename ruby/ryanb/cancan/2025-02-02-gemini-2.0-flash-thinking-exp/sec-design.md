# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the CanCan Github repository, addresses the critical business need for robust and flexible authorization in web applications built with Ruby on Rails. Authorization, the process of determining if a user is permitted to perform a specific action, is fundamental to securing applications and protecting sensitive data.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Ensure only authorized users can access specific features and data within Rails applications.
- Implement a clear and maintainable authorization logic that is easy for developers to understand and modify.
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized data access and manipulation, protecting business-critical information.
- Support various authorization models, from simple role-based access control (RBAC) to more complex permission-based systems.
- Facilitate compliance with data privacy regulations by controlling access to personal and sensitive data.

Business Risks:
- Authorization bypass vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
- Incorrectly configured or overly permissive authorization rules could expose data to unintended users.
- Complex or poorly documented authorization logic can be difficult to maintain and audit, increasing the risk of errors and security vulnerabilities.
- Performance bottlenecks in authorization checks could negatively impact application responsiveness and user experience.
- Lack of proper input validation in authorization logic could lead to injection attacks or other security exploits.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Ruby on Rails framework provides built-in security features, including protection against common web vulnerabilities like CSRF, SQL injection, and XSS. (Implemented by: Rails framework)
- security control: CanCan gem itself focuses on authorization logic, providing a structured way to define and enforce permissions within Rails applications. (Implemented by: CanCan gem)
- security control: Secure coding practices within the CanCan gem development, including code reviews and testing. (Implemented by: CanCan gem development process)
- accepted risk: Reliance on developers to correctly implement and integrate CanCan into their Rails applications. Misuse or misconfiguration of CanCan can lead to authorization vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying Ruby and Rails dependencies.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization within the Rails application, especially in areas related to user input that influences authorization decisions.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications using CanCan to identify and address potential authorization vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in the application code, including authorization logic.
- security control: Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) or web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent attacks targeting authorization vulnerabilities in production environments.
- security control: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation and training for developers on secure usage of CanCan and best practices for authorization in Rails applications.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The Rails application must implement a robust authentication mechanism to verify user identities before authorization checks are performed.
    - Requirement: CanCan should integrate seamlessly with the application's authentication system to identify the current user for authorization purposes.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: CanCan must provide a flexible and expressive way to define authorization rules based on user roles, permissions, and object attributes.
    - Requirement: Authorization rules should be centrally managed and easily auditable.
    - Requirement: CanCan should enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    - Requirement: Authorization checks should be performed consistently across the application, including controllers, views, and background jobs.
    - Requirement: CanCan should provide mechanisms to handle authorization failures gracefully, providing informative error messages to users without revealing sensitive information.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs that influence authorization decisions (e.g., user roles, object IDs) must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: CanCan should not rely on user-provided input without proper validation.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If sensitive data is used in authorization decisions or stored in relation to authorization rules, appropriate cryptographic measures (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit) should be implemented to protect confidentiality and integrity.
    - Requirement: Secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys used for encryption related to authorization.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Access control to application features and data is the primary critical business process protected by CanCan. This includes:
    - Protecting sensitive user data (personal information, financial data, etc.).
    - Controlling access to administrative functionalities.
    - Ensuring data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications.
    - Maintaining application availability by preventing unauthorized actions that could disrupt services.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data protected by CanCan varies depending on the application it is used in. It can include:
    - Highly Sensitive Data: User credentials, financial transactions, personal health information, confidential business data. Unauthorized access to this data can have severe consequences.
    - Sensitive Data: User profiles, order history, application settings. Unauthorized access can lead to privacy violations and reputational damage.
    - Public Data: Publicly accessible content, marketing materials. While less sensitive, unauthorized modification can still impact brand reputation.

The sensitivity of data depends heavily on the specific application using CanCan. However, given that CanCan is designed for authorization, it inherently deals with controlling access to potentially sensitive data. Therefore, the data being protected should be considered at least sensitive, and in many cases, highly sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of applications are intended to use CanCan? (e.g., SaaS, e-commerce, internal tools). This will help to refine the business and security posture.
- What is the expected scale and user base of applications using CanCan? This will influence scalability and performance considerations.
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using CanCan need to adhere to? This will impact security requirements.
- What authentication mechanisms are typically used with CanCan in target applications? (e.g., username/password, OAuth, SAML). This will affect integration considerations.
- What is the level of security expertise of developers who will be using CanCan? This will influence the need for documentation and ease of use.

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to build secure and reliable web applications using Ruby on Rails, where authorization is a critical component. Security and data protection are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Applications using CanCan are expected to follow secure software development lifecycle practices. Deployment environments are assumed to be at least moderately secure, potentially cloud-based. Developers are assumed to have a basic understanding of web application security principles.
- DESIGN: The typical deployment architecture involves a cloud platform with load balancing, multiple application instances, and a managed database service. The build process is automated using a CI/CD pipeline with basic security checks.
