# Threat Model Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Threat: [Route Hijacking due to Ambiguous Route Definitions](./threats/route_hijacking_due_to_ambiguous_route_definitions.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL that matches an earlier, less specific route than intended, bypassing intended access controls or triggering unintended functionality. This is due to Sinatra's route evaluation order.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended code paths, potential data manipulation or disclosure.
  - **Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` (routing mechanism)
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Define routes from most specific to most general.
    - Utilize named routes for clarity and reduced ambiguity.
    - Carefully review the order of route definitions, especially when using dynamic segments or regular expressions.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Matching](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_matching.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted URLs that cause the regular expressions used in route definitions to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. This exploits the backtracking behavior of certain regex patterns within Sinatra's routing.
  - **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, server overload, potential service disruption.
  - **Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` (route matching using regular expressions)
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep regular expressions in route definitions simple and efficient.
    - Avoid complex or nested quantifiers in route regex.
    - Test route regex for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    - Implement request timeouts to limit processing time.

## Threat: [Unintended File Access via Wildcard Routes](./threats/unintended_file_access_via_wildcard_routes.md)

- **Description:** If a route uses a wildcard (e.g., `/:file`) and the application directly uses this parameter to access files without sanitization, an attacker could access arbitrary files outside the intended directory. This is a direct consequence of how Sinatra exposes route parameters.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential code execution if executable files are accessed.
  - **Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` (route parameter handling)
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly sanitize and validate input from wildcard route parameters before using it for file access.
    - Restrict file access to specific, whitelisted directories.
    - Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sinatra Extensions (Gems)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sinatra_extensions__gems_.md)

- **Description:** Sinatra's functionality is extended by gems. Vulnerabilities in these gems can directly impact the Sinatra application's security. While not a core Sinatra vulnerability, it's a direct consequence of using Sinatra's extension mechanism.
  - **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
  - **Affected Component:**  Integration points within `Sinatra::Base` that load and interact with extensions.
  - **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully vet and audit any third-party gems used.
    - Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
    - Use tools like `bundle audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Issues Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_issues_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

- **Description:** The order of middleware in a Sinatra application is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security middleware (e.g., authentication) being bypassed, a direct issue with Sinatra's middleware handling.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing security controls.
  - **Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` (middleware stack management)
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully plan and document the order of your middleware stack.
    - Ensure security-related middleware is placed appropriately early in the pipeline.
    - Test your middleware stack to ensure the intended order of execution.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

- **Description:** While not strictly a Sinatra vulnerability, if sensitive configuration is handled poorly within a Sinatra application (e.g., hardcoded), it becomes a direct threat when the application is deployed.
  - **Impact:** Compromise of external services, unauthorized access to databases, potential financial loss.
  - **Affected Component:** Application code and configuration practices within the Sinatra framework.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use environment variables or secure configuration management tools.
    - Avoid committing sensitive data directly to version control.
    - Implement proper access controls for configuration files.
