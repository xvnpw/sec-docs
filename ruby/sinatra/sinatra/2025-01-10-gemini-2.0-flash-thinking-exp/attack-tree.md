## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra Routing Vulnerabilities - Parameter Injection in Route Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra_routing_vulnerabilities_-_parameter_injection_in_route_definitions.md)

* Attack Vector: By injecting malicious code or unexpected characters into route parameters, an attacker can manipulate the application's behavior. If the application uses these parameters to execute commands or construct database queries without proper sanitization, it can lead to severe consequences.
  * Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This grants the attacker full control over the application and potentially the underlying system. Database injection vulnerabilities are also possible if route parameters are used in database queries.
  * Example: A route defined as `/execute/:command` could be exploited by crafting a URL like `/execute/$(rm -rf /)`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra Routing Vulnerabilities - Path Traversal via Static File Serving](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra_routing_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal_via_static_file_serving.md)

* Attack Vector: If the application serves static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) and doesn't properly sanitize user-provided file paths, an attacker can use "../" sequences in the URL to navigate to parent directories and access files outside the intended public directory.
  * Potential Impact: Exposure of sensitive files such as configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys), source code, or even system files. This information can be used for further attacks or direct data breaches.
  * Example: A request to `/static/../../../config/database.yml` could potentially expose database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra Templating Vulnerabilities - Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra_templating_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* Attack Vector: When user-controlled data is directly embedded into template expressions without proper sanitization, the templating engine can interpret malicious input as code to be executed on the server.
  * Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application process, leading to full system compromise.
  * Example: In a Ruby ERB template, injecting `<%= system('whoami') %>` could execute the `whoami` command on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra Templating Vulnerabilities - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra_templating_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unescaped_output.md)

* Attack Vector: If user-provided data is rendered in HTML templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This script will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the page.
  * Potential Impact: Session hijacking (stealing user cookies), defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, or execution of other client-side attacks on unsuspecting users.
  * Example: Injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a comment field that is displayed on the page without proper escaping.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra Extension Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Related)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra_extension_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_.md)

* Attack Vector: Sinatra's functionality can be extended using third-party gems (extensions). If these extensions have vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, insecure deserialization), they can be exploited to compromise the application.
  * Potential Impact: The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the extension. It can range from information disclosure and data manipulation to Remote Code Execution (RCE), effectively compromising the application as if it were a core Sinatra vulnerability.
  * Example: A vulnerable authentication extension might allow bypassing login mechanisms, or a database interaction extension might be susceptible to SQL injection.
