# Attack Surface Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:**  Occurs when user-controlled data is directly embedded into template code without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows attackers to inject malicious code that is then executed on the server by the templating engine.

**How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra commonly uses templating engines like ERB or Haml to render dynamic content. If developers directly embed user input into these templates without proper escaping, SSTI vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Vulnerable code
get '/greet/:name' do
  @name = params[:name]
  erb "<h1>Hello, <%= @name %></h1>"
end

# Attacker can send a request like /greet/<%= system('whoami') %>
```

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing attackers to take full control of the server, read sensitive files, or perform other malicious actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always escape user input** when rendering it in templates. Most templating engines provide mechanisms for this (e.g., `h()` in ERB).
*   Avoid directly embedding user input into template code.
*   Use templating engines in their secure default configurations.
*   Consider using logic-less templating languages where possible.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:**  Weaknesses in how user sessions are created, managed, and invalidated can allow attackers to hijack sessions and impersonate legitimate users.

**How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra provides basic session management, often using cookie-based sessions. If not configured securely, these sessions can be vulnerable.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Using default session configuration (Rack::Session::Cookie) without secure flags
enable :sessions

get '/login' do
  session[:user_id] = 123
  "Logged in!"
end
```

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use secure session middleware:** Configure session middleware (e.g., `Rack::Session::Cookie`) with `secure: true` and `httponly: true` flags.
*   **Use strong session IDs:** Ensure session IDs are long, random, and unpredictable.
*   **Implement session timeouts:** Automatically invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity.
*   **Regenerate session IDs:** Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
*   **Store sensitive data securely:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the session. If necessary, encrypt it.
*   **Proper session invalidation:** Invalidate sessions upon logout and other security-sensitive actions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Misconfigured Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_misconfigured_middleware.md)

**Description:**  Sinatra applications often use middleware to add functionality. Vulnerabilities in these middleware components or their incorrect configuration can introduce security risks.

**How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra's middleware architecture allows for extending functionality. However, developers are responsible for selecting and configuring middleware securely.

**Example:**
*   Using an outdated version of a middleware component with known vulnerabilities.
*   Incorrectly configuring an authentication middleware, allowing bypasses.

**Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, including authentication bypass, data breaches, and remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date:** Regularly update all middleware components to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Carefully review middleware configurations:** Ensure middleware is configured securely according to its documentation and security best practices.
*   **Understand the purpose and security implications of each middleware component.**
*   **Follow security recommendations provided by middleware developers.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (Serving Static Files)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities__serving_static_files_.md)

**Description:** If the application serves static files based on user input without proper sanitization, attackers might be able to access files outside the intended directory.

**How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra provides methods for serving static files. If the path to the file is derived from user input without validation, path traversal can occur.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Vulnerable code
get '/files/:filename' do
  send_file "public/#{params[:filename]}"
end

# Attacker can send a request like /files/../../../../etc/passwd
```

**Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using user input directly in file paths.**
*   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization** for any user-provided file names.
*   **Use whitelisting:** Only allow access to files within a specific, controlled directory.
*   **Use secure file serving mechanisms:**  Consider using dedicated file servers or cloud storage solutions for serving static content.
