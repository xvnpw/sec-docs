### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Template Injection (If using template engines unsafely) [CRITICAL]

#### 4.1. Understanding Template Injection

Template Injection is a server-side vulnerability that arises when a web application embeds user-supplied input into templates without proper sanitization or escaping. Template engines are designed to dynamically generate web pages by combining static templates with dynamic data. They use special syntax to evaluate expressions and insert data into the output.

When user input is directly injected into a template and interpreted as template code instead of plain text, attackers can manipulate the template engine to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is because template engines often have powerful features that allow for code execution, variable access, and system commands.

#### 4.2. Template Injection in Sinatra Applications

Sinatra is a lightweight Ruby web framework that commonly uses template engines like ERB (Embedded Ruby), Haml, and Slim to render dynamic web pages.  Sinatra provides built-in support for rendering templates using methods like `erb`, `haml`, and `slim`.

**Vulnerable Scenario:**

Consider a simple Sinatra application that takes user input from a query parameter and displays it in a view using ERB:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  name = params[:name]
  erb :index, locals: { name: name }
end

__END__

@@ index
<h1>Hello, <%= name %>!</h1>
```

In this example, the `params[:name]` (user input from the `name` query parameter) is directly passed to the ERB template and embedded within the `<h1>` tag using `<%= name %>`.  **This is the vulnerable point.**

**Attack Vector:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload in the `name` query parameter. Instead of providing a simple name, they can inject template engine syntax.

**Example Attack Payload (ERB):**

Let's say an attacker sends the following request:

```
GET /?name=<%= system('whoami') %>
```

When Sinatra processes this request, the `params[:name]` will be `<%= system('whoami') %>`. This value is then passed to the ERB template. ERB will interpret `<%= system('whoami') %>` as Ruby code to be executed.

**Execution Flow:**

1.  **Request Received:** Sinatra receives the GET request with the malicious `name` parameter.
2.  **Parameter Extraction:** Sinatra extracts the `name` parameter value: `<%= system('whoami') %>`.
3.  **Template Rendering:** Sinatra calls `erb :index, locals: { name: name }`.
4.  **ERB Processing:** ERB template engine processes `index.erb`. It encounters `<%= name %>` and substitutes the value of `name`, which is `<%= system('whoami') %>`.
5.  **Nested Evaluation (Vulnerability):** ERB, in its default configuration, will *further* evaluate the embedded Ruby code `<%= system('whoami') %>`.
6.  **Code Execution:** The `system('whoami')` Ruby command is executed on the server. This command will execute the `whoami` shell command, which returns the username of the user running the Sinatra application.
7.  **Response Generation:** The output of `system('whoami')` (the username) will be embedded into the HTML response, and the attacker will see the username in the rendered page.

**Example Vulnerable Haml Code:**

Similarly, Haml can be vulnerable if user input is not properly handled:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'haml'

get '/' do
  message = params[:message]
  haml :index, locals: { message: message }
end

__END__

@@ index.haml
%h1= message
```

An attacker could send a request like:

```
GET /?message=#{system('ls -al')}
```

Haml will interpret `#{system('ls -al')}` as Ruby code to be executed.

#### 4.3. Why Template Injection is High-Risk: Remote Code Execution (RCE)

The primary reason Template Injection is considered a CRITICAL vulnerability is its potential to lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. As demonstrated in the examples above, attackers can inject code that is executed directly on the server.

**Consequences of RCE:**

*   **Complete Server Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the server. They can execute arbitrary commands, install backdoors, modify system files, and potentially pivot to other systems within the network.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored on the server, including databases, configuration files, and user data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can crash the server or disrupt its services.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can use the compromised server to host and distribute malware.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful RCE attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode customer trust.

#### 4.4. Mitigation and Prevention Strategies

To prevent Template Injection vulnerabilities in Sinatra applications, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only accept the necessary input and validate it against expected formats and values.
    *   **Escape User Input:**  Before embedding user input into templates, always escape it appropriately for the template engine being used.  Sinatra and template engines often provide built-in escaping mechanisms.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Use template engine features that automatically handle output encoding based on the context (e.g., HTML, JavaScript).

2.  **Secure Templating Practices:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Code Execution in Templates:**  Minimize the use of template engine features that allow for arbitrary code execution.  Prefer logic in the application code rather than in templates.
    *   **Use Safe Template Engines or Configurations:** Some template engines or configurations might offer safer modes or features that limit code execution capabilities. Research and utilize these if available.
    *   **Template Security Audits:** Regularly review templates for potential vulnerabilities and ensure secure coding practices are followed.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources. While CSP won't directly prevent server-side Template Injection, it can mitigate some of the potential post-exploitation impacts, especially if the attacker tries to inject client-side JavaScript code through Template Injection.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including Template Injection, in Sinatra applications.

**Example of Mitigation (ERB - Using `CGI.escapeHTML` for escaping):**

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'cgi'

get '/' do
  name = params[:name]
  erb :index, locals: { name: CGI.escapeHTML(name) } # Escape user input
end

__END__

@@ index
<h1>Hello, <%= name %>!</h1>
```

In this mitigated example, `CGI.escapeHTML(name)` is used to escape the user input before it's passed to the template. This will convert characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` into their HTML entity equivalents, preventing the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags or attributes and preventing the template engine from interpreting them as code.

**Important Note:** The specific escaping method and best practices may vary depending on the template engine being used (ERB, Haml, Slim, etc.). Always consult the documentation for the chosen template engine and Sinatra for the recommended secure templating practices.

#### 5. Conclusion

Template Injection in Sinatra applications, especially when using template engines unsafely, is a critical vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution.  It is crucial for development teams to understand this risk and implement robust mitigation strategies. By properly sanitizing user input, adopting secure templating practices, and conducting regular security assessments, developers can significantly reduce the risk of Template Injection and protect their Sinatra applications from this severe attack vector.  Prioritizing secure coding practices and awareness of template injection vulnerabilities is essential for building secure Sinatra applications.
