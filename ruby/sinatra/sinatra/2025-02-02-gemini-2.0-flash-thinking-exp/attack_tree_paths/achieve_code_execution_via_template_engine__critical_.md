### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Achieve Code Execution via Template Engine [CRITICAL]

**Attack Vector:** The template engine executes the injected code, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.

**Why High-Risk:** Remote Code Execution, full server compromise.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path exploits a vulnerability known as **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**. SSTI occurs when user-provided data is directly embedded into a template and evaluated by the template engine without proper sanitization or escaping.  Template engines are designed to dynamically generate web pages by embedding variables and logic within templates. However, if an attacker can control the input that is rendered by the template engine, they can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server when the template is processed.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Template Engine and Input Points:**
    * **Template Engine Detection:** The attacker first attempts to identify which template engine is being used by the Sinatra application. Common engines include ERB (default for Sinatra), Haml, and Slim. This can sometimes be inferred from file extensions (`.erb`, `.haml`, `.slim`) or error messages.
    * **Input Point Discovery:** The attacker then identifies potential input points that are rendered within templates. These input points can be:
        * **URL Parameters:** Data passed in the URL query string (e.g., `/?name=user`).
        * **Form Data:** Data submitted through HTML forms (e.g., POST requests).
        * **Headers:** HTTP headers that might be processed and displayed.
        * **Database Content:** Data retrieved from a database and displayed in templates without proper escaping.
        * **Cookies:**  Less common, but potentially vulnerable if cookie values are directly rendered.

2. **Inject Template Engine Syntax:**
    * Once an input point is identified, the attacker attempts to inject template engine syntax into it. This syntax is specific to the template engine being used.
    * **ERB Example:** For ERB, the attacker would try injecting code within `<%= ... %>` tags, which are used for evaluating Ruby code within ERB templates.
    * **Haml/Slim Examples:**  Haml and Slim have different syntaxes, but the principle remains the same â€“ injecting code constructs that the template engine will interpret and execute.

3. **Test for Code Execution (Initial Confirmation):**
    * The attacker crafts simple payloads within the template syntax to test for code execution and confirm the SSTI vulnerability.
    * **Example Payloads (ERB):**
        * `<%= 7*7 %>`:  If the output displays "49", it indicates code execution.
        * `<%= "test".upcase %>`: If the output displays "TEST", it confirms code execution.
        * `<%= Time.now %>`:  If the current timestamp is displayed, it further confirms code execution.

4. **Escalate to Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    * After confirming SSTI, the attacker crafts more sophisticated payloads to achieve Remote Code Execution. This involves using template engine syntax to execute system commands or arbitrary Ruby code on the server.
    * **Common RCE Payloads (ERB - Ruby Specific):**
        * `<%= system("whoami") %>`: Executes the `whoami` command and displays the output (username).
        * `<%= `ls -al` %>`: Executes the `ls -al` command and displays the directory listing. (Note: backticks execute shell commands in Ruby)
        * `<%= Kernel.eval('system("id")') %>`: Uses `Kernel.eval` to evaluate a string as Ruby code, executing the `id` command.
        * `<%= instance_eval('system("cat /etc/passwd")') %>`: Similar to `Kernel.eval`, but uses `instance_eval` in the context of the template object.
        * **Payload Obfuscation:** Attackers may use techniques to obfuscate payloads to bypass basic security filters (e.g., string concatenation, encoding).

5. **Post-Exploitation and Server Compromise:**
    * Once RCE is achieved, the attacker has gained a foothold on the server and can perform various malicious actions:
        * **Data Exfiltration:** Access and steal sensitive data from the server, databases, and configuration files.
        * **System Compromise:** Install backdoors, malware, or ransomware to maintain persistent access and further compromise the system.
        * **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupt the application's availability or the entire server.
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Attempt to escalate privileges to gain root or administrator access.

**Example Scenario (Sinatra with ERB - Vulnerable Code):**

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/greet' do
  name = params[:name] # User input from URL parameter
  erb :greeting, locals: { name: name }
end

__END__

@@ greeting
<h1>Hello, <%= name %></h1>
```

**Vulnerable Request:**

An attacker could send a request like:

```
/greet?name=<%= system('whoami') %>
```

**Exploitation:**

When Sinatra processes this request, the `name` parameter containing `<%= system('whoami') %>` is passed to the `erb` template. The ERB engine will evaluate the code within `<%= ... %>`, executing the `system('whoami')` command on the server. The output of the `whoami` command will then be embedded into the HTML response.

**Impact:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  As demonstrated, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Full Server Compromise:** RCE allows attackers to gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive data, customer information, and application secrets.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data.
    * **Service Disruption:**  Denial of service or application downtime.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and credibility.
    * **Financial Losses:** Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal liabilities, and business disruption.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Input Sanitization and Validation (Insufficient on its own for SSTI):**
    * While important for general security, input sanitization alone is often insufficient to prevent SSTI. Attackers can often bypass basic sanitization by crafting payloads that are still valid template syntax after sanitization.

2. **Output Encoding/Escaping (Context-Aware Escaping is Crucial):**
    * **Use Template Engine's Escaping Features:**  Ensure that output is properly escaped by the template engine by default or explicitly using escaping functions.
    * **Context-Aware Escaping:**  Escape output based on the context where it's being used (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).  For HTML context, use HTML escaping.
    * **ERB Example (HTML Escaping):**
        ```erb
        <h1>Hello, <%= ERB::Util.html_escape(name) %></h1>
        ```
        This will escape HTML special characters in the `name` variable, preventing interpretation as code.

3. **Use Logic-less Templates (Consider for certain parts of the application):**
    * For parts of the application where dynamic content is minimal, consider using logic-less template engines or static site generators. This reduces the attack surface for SSTI.

4. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Run the Sinatra application with the minimum necessary privileges. If the application is compromised, limiting the privileges of the application user can reduce the impact of RCE.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Deploy a WAF to detect and block common SSTI attack patterns. WAFs can provide an additional layer of defense, but should not be relied upon as the sole mitigation.

6. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strong Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources. While CSP doesn't directly prevent SSTI, it can mitigate some post-exploitation scenarios by limiting the attacker's ability to load external scripts or resources after RCE.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential SSTI vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in the application.

8. **Secure Coding Practices and Developer Training:**
    * Educate developers on secure coding practices, specifically regarding template injection vulnerabilities and how to avoid them. Emphasize the importance of never directly embedding unsanitized user input into templates.

**Conclusion:**

The "Achieve Code Execution via Template Engine" attack path represents a critical security risk for Sinatra applications. Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete server compromise and severe consequences. By understanding the attack vector, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and adopting secure coding practices, development teams can effectively protect their Sinatra applications from this dangerous threat.  Prioritizing output escaping and developer education are key steps in preventing SSTI vulnerabilities.
