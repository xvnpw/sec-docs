Sinatra's templating engines (like ERB or Haml) often provide built-in encoding mechanisms, ensure they are used correctly.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP headers to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**  While output encoding is the primary defense against XSS, input validation and sanitization can also help reduce the attack surface.
        * **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix XSS vulnerabilities.

* **Attack Vector 9: Template Injection**
    * **Description:** If the Sinatra application uses a templating engine (like ERB or Haml) and directly incorporates user input into template code without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious template code. This can lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server or deface the application.
    * **Prerequisites:**
        * Sinatra application uses a templating engine.
        * User input is directly used within template code without proper sanitization.
    * **Potential Impact:**
