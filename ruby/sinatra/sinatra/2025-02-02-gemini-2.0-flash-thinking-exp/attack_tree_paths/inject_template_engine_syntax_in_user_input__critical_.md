### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Template Engine Syntax in User Input [CRITICAL]

**Attack Vector Details:**

The attack vector involves crafting malicious user input that contains template engine directives. In the context of ERB (and similar template engines), this typically means embedding code within delimiters like `<% ... %>` or `<%= ... %>`.

*   **`<% ... %>` (Scriptlet Tags):**  Executes Ruby code but does not output the result to the template.
*   **`<%= ... %>` (Output Tags):** Executes Ruby code and outputs the result to the template.

An attacker attempts to inject these directives into user input fields (e.g., form fields, URL parameters, headers) that are subsequently used within a Sinatra template without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Technical Explanation:**

1.  **Sinatra Template Rendering:** Sinatra uses template engines to dynamically generate HTML responses. When a Sinatra route renders a template (e.g., using `erb :index`), the template engine processes the template file.
2.  **User Input Incorporation:**  Vulnerabilities arise when user-provided data is directly embedded into the template during rendering. This often happens when developers pass user input directly to the template engine without proper handling.
3.  **Template Engine Interpretation:** If the user input contains template engine syntax (like `<% ... %>`), the template engine will interpret this input as code to be executed *within the context of the template engine*.
4.  **Code Execution:**  If the injected code is malicious, it can be executed by the template engine on the server. This can lead to various security breaches, depending on the attacker's payload and the application's environment.

**Why High-Risk (Justification for "CRITICAL"):**

This attack path is classified as **CRITICAL** because successful exploitation can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. RCE is one of the most severe security vulnerabilities as it allows an attacker to:

*   **Gain complete control of the server:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially taking over the entire system.
*   **Data Breach and Exfiltration:** Access sensitive data, including application data, user credentials, and potentially system files.
*   **Application Defacement:** Modify the application's content and functionality.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crash the application or server.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

The impact is not limited to data breaches; it can compromise the entire infrastructure and business operations.

**Potential Impact Scenarios:**

*   **Displaying Sensitive Data:** An attacker could inject code to access and display environment variables, database credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the server.
*   **Modifying Application Logic:** Inject code to alter the application's behavior, bypass authentication, or manipulate data.
*   **Executing System Commands:**  Use Ruby's system execution capabilities (e.g., `system()`, `` ` ``) within the injected code to run arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.
*   **Reading Local Files:** Access and read sensitive files from the server's file system.

**Example Vulnerable Sinatra Code (Illustrative):**

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  name = params[:name] # User input from query parameter 'name'
  erb :index, locals: { name: name }
end

__END__

@@ index.erb
<h1>Hello, <%= name %>!</h1>
```

**In this vulnerable example:**

If a user visits `/` with a query parameter like `/?name=<%= system('whoami') %>`, the ERB template engine will execute `system('whoami')` on the server, and the output of the `whoami` command will be embedded in the HTML response. This demonstrates direct code execution.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the "Inject Template Engine Syntax in User Input" vulnerability in Sinatra applications, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  **Crucially, always escape user input before embedding it in templates.**  Sinatra's ERB (and other template engines) provide mechanisms for automatic escaping.

    *   **ERB's Automatic Escaping (Default in Sinatra):** By default, ERB in Sinatra escapes HTML entities.  However, this is often insufficient for preventing template injection if the input is intended to be *interpreted* by the template engine.  **Do not rely solely on default HTML escaping for template injection prevention.**

    *   **Explicit Escaping Functions:** Use template engine-specific escaping functions if necessary for specific contexts. For example, if you are dealing with JavaScript within a template, you might need JavaScript escaping.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Validate User Input:**  Strictly validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and data types. Reject or sanitize input that does not meet these criteria.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  Remove or encode potentially harmful characters or patterns from user input before using it in templates.  However, **sanitization is generally less reliable than output encoding/escaping for preventing template injection.**  It's better to treat user input as *data* and escape it for display rather than trying to sanitize it to be "safe code".

3.  **Contextual Output Encoding:**

    *   **Understand the Output Context:**  Be aware of the context where user input is being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Apply appropriate encoding/escaping based on the context.  For HTML, HTML escaping is essential. For JavaScript, JavaScript escaping is needed.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**

    *   **Minimize Template Engine Functionality:** If possible, restrict the functionality available within templates.  Avoid allowing templates to perform complex logic or direct system calls.  Keep templates focused on presentation.
    *   **Run Application with Least Privilege:** Ensure the Sinatra application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage if code execution occurs.

5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    *   **Implement CSP Headers:**  Use Content Security Policy headers to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of template injection attacks, especially those that aim to inject malicious scripts.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**

    *   **Conduct Regular Audits:**  Periodically review the application's codebase for potential template injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Implement code reviews to have another pair of eyes examine code changes and identify potential security issues before they are deployed.

**Secure Sinatra Code Example (Mitigated):**

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  name = params[:name] # User input from query parameter 'name'
  erb :index, locals: { name: name }
end

__END__

@@ index.erb
<h1>Hello, <%= Rack::Utils.escape_html(name) %>!</h1>
```

**Explanation of Mitigation in Secure Example:**

*   **`Rack::Utils.escape_html(name)`:**  This line explicitly HTML-escapes the `name` variable before it is inserted into the HTML.  This ensures that any HTML special characters (including `<` and `>`) in the user input are converted to their HTML entity equivalents (e.g., `&lt;` and `&gt;`).  This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags and, crucially, prevents the template engine from interpreting them as template directives.

**Best Practices Summary:**

*   **Treat User Input as Untrusted Data:** Always assume user input is potentially malicious.
*   **Escape Output, Don't Sanitize Input (Primarily for Template Injection):** Focus on properly encoding output for the specific context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) rather than trying to sanitize input to be "safe code".
*   **Keep Templates Simple:**  Avoid complex logic and direct system calls within templates.
*   **Regularly Review and Audit Code:**  Proactively look for potential template injection vulnerabilities.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of "Inject Template Engine Syntax in User Input" vulnerabilities in Sinatra applications and protect against potential Remote Code Execution attacks.
