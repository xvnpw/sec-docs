# Threat Model Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected application behavior. For example, an attacker might modify a user ID parameter in a route like `/users/:id` to access another user's profile without authorization. This is done by directly modifying the URL or request parameters. This threat is directly related to Sinatra's routing mechanism and how parameters are extracted and used.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionalities, potential data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Sinatra Component Affected:** `Sinatra::Base` (Routing system, `params` hash)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all route parameters before using them in application logic.
    *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Routing:** Define routes as narrowly as possible and avoid overly permissive parameter patterns.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a session ID controlled by the attacker. After the user authenticates, the attacker can hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access. This is typically typically done by providing the victim with a link containing a pre-set session ID or by injecting a session cookie. This threat is directly related to Sinatra's built-in session management and how session IDs are handled.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
*   **Sinatra Component Affected:** `Sinatra::Base` (Session management, `session` hash)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Session ID Regeneration:** Regenerate the session ID after successful user authentication.
    *   **HTTP-only and Secure Flags:** Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
    *   **Server-Side Session Storage:** Consider using server-side session storage instead of relying solely on cookies.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unencoded Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unencoded_output.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This is possible when the application fails to properly encode user-supplied data before displaying it in HTML. For example, if user comments are displayed without HTML escaping, an attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in other users' browsers. While XSS is a general web threat, Sinatra's minimalist nature and reliance on developers to handle output encoding explicitly makes it a relevant Sinatra-specific concern.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of website, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Sinatra Component Affected:** `Sinatra::Base` (View rendering, output handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:** Always encode output data before rendering it in views. Use appropriate encoding functions like HTML escaping (`CGI.escapeHTML` in Ruby or templating engine's escaping features).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Middleware Component](./threats/vulnerable_middleware_component.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a middleware component used by the Sinatra application. This could be a vulnerability in a popular gem used as middleware for authentication, logging, or other functionalities. Attackers can leverage public exploits or develop custom exploits to target these vulnerabilities. While middleware is external to Sinatra core, Sinatra applications heavily rely on middleware, making middleware vulnerabilities a significant threat in the Sinatra context.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Sinatra Component Affected:** Rack Middleware (used within Sinatra applications)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies (gems) for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundle audit`.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Careful Middleware Selection:** Choose well-maintained and reputable middleware components.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories for used middleware components.
