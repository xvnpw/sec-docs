# Attack Surface Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Definitions - Lack of Route Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_definitions_-_lack_of_route_authorization.md)

**Description:** Routes are accessible without proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to access and interact with application functionality.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra itself does not enforce authorization. It's the developer's responsibility to implement authorization logic within route handlers. The simplicity of Sinatra can sometimes lead to developers overlooking authorization.

**Example:** A route `/admin/dashboard` is accessible to any user without checking for admin privileges, allowing unauthorized users to access administrative functions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Enforce authorization checks at the beginning of each route handler that requires protection.
* Use middleware or helper functions to centralize and simplify authorization logic.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Definitions - Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_definitions_-_route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** Route parameters are directly used in backend operations (e.g., database queries, system commands) without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra provides easy access to route parameters via `params[:param_name]`. This ease of access can encourage developers to directly use these parameters without proper validation and sanitization.

**Example:** A route `/users/:id` uses `params[:id]` directly in a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{params[:id]}`. An attacker could inject SQL code by providing a malicious `id` value like `' OR 1=1 --`.

**Impact:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, or other injection vulnerabilities leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate route parameters before using them in backend operations.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL Injection.
* Avoid directly constructing system commands with route parameters. If necessary, use secure command execution methods and carefully sanitize inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** User-controlled input is directly embedded into server-side templates without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious template code.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra commonly uses templating engines like ERB or Haml. If developers directly embed user input into templates without proper escaping, SSTI vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** A Sinatra application uses ERB and directly embeds `params[:name]` into a template like `<p>Hello, <%= params[:name] %></p>`. An attacker could inject malicious ERB code in the `name` parameter, potentially achieving remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, data exfiltration, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly embedding user input into templates.
* Use templating engines' built-in escaping mechanisms to properly escape user input before rendering it in templates.
* Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Definitions - Overly Permissive Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_definitions_-_overly_permissive_route_matching.md)

**Description:** Routes defined with overly broad patterns (e.g., excessive wildcards) can match unintended requests, exposing functionality that should be restricted.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra's flexible routing system allows for very broad route definitions using wildcards and regular expressions. This flexibility, if not used carefully, can lead to overly permissive routes.

**Example:** A route defined as `/users/*` might unintentionally match requests like `/users/admin/delete` if not properly restricted, potentially exposing administrative functions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define routes with specific and restrictive patterns.
* Avoid excessive use of wildcards.
* Implement explicit authorization checks within route handlers to verify user permissions before granting access.

## Attack Surface: [Request Parameter Handling - Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/request_parameter_handling_-_lack_of_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Description:** Request parameters (from POST, PUT, GET requests) are not properly validated and sanitized before being used in application logic, leading to various vulnerabilities.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra provides easy access to request parameters via `params` and `request.body`. It does not enforce input validation, leaving it entirely to the developer.

**Example:** A form field value is directly displayed on a webpage without HTML encoding, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Or, a file path from a request parameter is used directly in file system operations, leading to Path Traversal.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, and other vulnerabilities leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation for all request parameters, checking data type, format, length, and allowed values.
* Sanitize all user inputs before using them in application logic, especially before displaying them in web pages or using them in backend operations.
* Apply context-specific output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Inadequate Output Encoding](./attack_surfaces/inadequate_output_encoding.md)

**Description:** Data displayed in templates or output to the user is not properly encoded for the output context (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, URL), leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra does not automatically handle output encoding. Developers are responsible for ensuring proper encoding based on the context where the data is being displayed.

**Example:** User-provided text is displayed in an HTML page without HTML encoding. If the text contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover, or defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always encode output data based on the output context.
* Use HTML encoding for displaying data in HTML pages.
* Use JavaScript encoding for embedding data in JavaScript code.
* Utilize templating engines' built-in output encoding features.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Cookie Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_cookie_configuration.md)

**Description:** Session cookies are not configured with secure attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags) or use a weak session secret, making them vulnerable to attacks.

**Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra uses Rack's session middleware by default. Default configurations might not be secure. Developers need to explicitly configure session options for security.

**Example:** Session cookies are missing the `HttpOnly` flag, allowing JavaScript to access them and potentially leading to session hijacking via XSS. Or, the `Secure` flag is missing, allowing cookies to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, session fixation, unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure session cookies with `HttpOnly` flag to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
* Configure session cookies with `Secure` flag to ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
* Use a strong and randomly generated session secret.
