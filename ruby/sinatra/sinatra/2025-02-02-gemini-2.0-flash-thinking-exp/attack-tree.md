## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Sinatra Application [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_sinatra_application__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the Sinatra application and potentially its underlying infrastructure and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sinatra-Specific Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sinatra-specific_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This category focuses on weaknesses directly related to Sinatra's design, features, or common usage patterns. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows attackers to bypass intended security mechanisms or directly manipulate application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

Sinatra's routing system, while flexible, can be a source of vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented. Attackers target weaknesses in how routes are defined and processed to gain unintended access or execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Route Parameter Manipulation [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/route_parameter_manipulation__critical_.md)

Attack Vector: Sinatra routes often use parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`). Attackers manipulate these parameters in the URL to access resources or trigger actions they shouldn't be authorized to.
Why High-Risk:  Common and easy to exploit. If application code unsafely uses route parameters (e.g., in file paths, database queries, system commands), it can lead to serious vulnerabilities like Path Traversal, SQL Injection, or Command Injection.
Example:  A route `/files/:filename` might be vulnerable to Path Traversal if the application directly uses `params[:filename]` to access files without proper validation, allowing an attacker to request `/files/../../etc/passwd`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Parameter Value (e.g., Path Traversal, Command Injection if used unsafely) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_parameter_value__e_g___path_traversal__command_injection_if_used_unsafely___critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  This is the actual exploitation step where the attacker crafts malicious parameter values to trigger vulnerabilities.
Why High-Risk: Directly leads to critical impacts like data breaches, remote code execution, and server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Weaknesses [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_weaknesses__critical_.md)

Sinatra applications process HTTP requests, and weaknesses in how they handle request data (especially user-provided input) are a major source of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Parameter Handling [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_parameter_handling__critical_.md)

Attack Vector: Sinatra applications receive user input through `params`. If this input is not properly validated, sanitized, and encoded before being used in application logic, it can lead to various injection attacks.
Why High-Risk: Extremely common vulnerability category in web applications. Sinatra's simplicity means developers must be extra vigilant about input handling as security features are not automatically enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads in Parameters (e.g., SQL Injection, Code Injection) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_in_parameters__e_g___sql_injection__code_injection___critical_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious code or SQL syntax into request parameters.
Why High-Risk: SQL Injection can lead to database breaches, while Code Injection (especially in Ruby using `eval`, `system`, etc.) can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Injection (e.g., if parameters are used in `eval`, `system`, etc.) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_injection__e_g___if_parameters_are_used_in__eval____system___etc____critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  Specifically targeting scenarios where Sinatra application code uses user-controlled parameters in dangerous Ruby functions like `eval`, `system`, backticks, or `instance_eval`.
Why High-Risk: Direct Remote Code Execution, allowing full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Handling (If application uses file uploads/processing) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_handling__if_application_uses_file_uploadsprocessing___critical_.md)

Attack Vector: If the Sinatra application allows file uploads, vulnerabilities in how these files are handled (validation, storage, access, execution) can be exploited.
Why High-Risk: File upload vulnerabilities are a classic path to Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious File (e.g., Web Shell, Exploit Payload) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_file__e_g___web_shell__exploit_payload___critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  Uploading files containing malicious code, such as web shells (scripts that allow remote command execution) or exploit payloads.
Why High-Risk:  Directly sets up the next step for RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution by accessing/executing uploaded file [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution_by_accessingexecuting_uploaded_file__critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  Exploiting vulnerabilities (like Path Traversal or misconfigurations) to access the uploaded malicious file and then execute it on the server.
Why High-Risk:  Full server compromise, data breaches, service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection (If using template engines unsafely) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection__if_using_template_engines_unsafely___critical_.md)

Attack Vector: If the Sinatra application uses template engines (like ERB, Haml) and unsafely embeds user input directly into templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject template engine syntax.
Why High-Risk: Template engines often allow code execution. Template Injection can lead to Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Template Engine Syntax in User Input [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_template_engine_syntax_in_user_input__critical_.md)

Attack Vector: Crafting user input that contains template engine directives (e.g., `<% ... %>` in ERB) to be interpreted by the template engine.
Why High-Risk:  Sets up the next step for code execution within the template engine context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution via Template Engine [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution_via_template_engine__critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  The template engine executes the injected code, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
Why High-Risk:  Remote Code Execution, full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Management Vulnerabilities (If default or poorly implemented sessions are used):](./attack_tree_paths/session_management_vulnerabilities__if_default_or_poorly_implemented_sessions_are_used_.md)

Attack Vector: Weaknesses in how Sinatra applications manage user sessions can allow attackers to hijack sessions, impersonate users, or gain unauthorized access.
Why High-Risk: Session vulnerabilities can lead to account takeover, data breaches, and unauthorized actions performed under a legitimate user's identity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking (If session cookies are not secure) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking__if_session_cookies_are_not_secure___critical_.md)

Attack Vector: Stealing a valid session cookie (e.g., through network sniffing if HTTPS is not used, or via Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
Why High-Risk:  Allows direct impersonation of a logged-in user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Storage (If default cookie-based sessions are used without proper security) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_storage__if_default_cookie-based_sessions_are_used_without_proper_security___critic_84b005ed.md)

Attack Vector: If Sinatra uses default cookie-based sessions without proper signing or encryption, attackers can analyze and modify the session cookie content.
Why High-Risk:  Allows attackers to directly manipulate session data to elevate privileges, bypass authentication, or access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Session Cookie Data (If integrity checks are weak or absent) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/modify_session_cookie_data__if_integrity_checks_are_weak_or_absent___critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  Tampering with the session cookie content to inject malicious data or change user roles/permissions.
Why High-Risk:  Directly leads to privilege escalation and authentication bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Deployment Issues (Common in simple frameworks like Sinatra if not hardened):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_deployment_issues__common_in_simple_frameworks_like_sinatra_if_not_hardene_58cf0526.md)

Misconfigurations and insecure deployment practices are common in quickly set up Sinatra applications, especially if security is not a primary focus during development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production:](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

Attack Vector: Leaving debug mode enabled in production environments exposes sensitive information like stack traces, configuration details, and internal application paths.
Why High-Risk: Information disclosure aids further attacks. Stack traces can reveal code paths and potential vulnerabilities. Path disclosure helps in Path Traversal attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Security Headers (Common oversight in quick Sinatra setups):](./attack_tree_paths/missing_security_headers__common_oversight_in_quick_sinatra_setups_.md)

Attack Vector:  Failing to implement essential security headers (like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) leaves the application vulnerable to client-side attacks.
Why High-Risk: Missing headers can enable Clickjacking, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Mixed Content vulnerabilities, compromising user security and application integrity.
