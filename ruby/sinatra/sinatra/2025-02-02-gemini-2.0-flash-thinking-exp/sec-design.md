# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Sinatra, is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) written in Ruby that provides a minimal and flexible framework for creating web applications. Its primary business priority is to enable rapid development of web applications and APIs with a focus on simplicity and ease of use for developers.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Rapid web application development.
  - Ease of use and developer productivity.
  - Flexibility and minimal framework overhead.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized web applications, APIs, and prototypes.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in applications built with Sinatra due to its minimalist nature and reliance on developer implementation for security controls.
  - Risk of insecure configurations if developers are not security-aware.
  - Potential for supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies are not managed securely.
  - Risk of data breaches if applications handle sensitive data without proper security measures.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Sinatra, being a lightweight framework, provides the building blocks for web applications but relies heavily on the developer to implement security controls.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS support - Implemented through web server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache) and application configuration.
  - security control: Session management - Provided by Rack middleware, allowing for session-based authentication.
  - security control: Input validation guidance - Documented best practices for developers to implement input validation within their applications.
  - security control: Protection against common web vulnerabilities - Framework design aims to avoid introducing common vulnerabilities, but developer implementation is crucial.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on developer responsibility for implementing security controls.
  - accepted risk: Potential for insecure applications if developers lack security expertise.
  - accepted risk: Default configurations might not be secure out-of-the-box and require developer hardening.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in Sinatra applications.
  - security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in Sinatra application dependencies.
  - security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and training for developers using Sinatra, emphasizing common web security vulnerabilities and best practices.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate security code reviews for Sinatra applications, especially those handling sensitive data or critical business processes.
  - security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) for deployed Sinatra applications to identify runtime vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Applications built with Sinatra should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
    - Requirement: Support for various authentication methods, such as username/password, multi-factor authentication, and integration with identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, SAML).
    - Requirement: Secure storage of authentication credentials, avoiding storing passwords in plaintext.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Applications should implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities based on roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied, granting users only the necessary permissions.
    - Requirement: Authorization logic should be consistently enforced across the application.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
    - Requirement: Encode outputs properly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between clients and the Sinatra application.
    - Requirement: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in databases or other persistent storage.
    - Requirement: Use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - This depends entirely on the application built using Sinatra. It could range from simple content delivery to critical business operations like e-commerce transactions, financial processing, or healthcare data management. The criticality is defined by the specific application's purpose and impact on the business.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Similarly, data sensitivity is application-specific. Sinatra applications might handle:
    - Publicly available information (low sensitivity).
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like user names, emails, addresses (medium sensitivity).
    - Sensitive personal data, financial data, health records, or confidential business information (high sensitivity).
  - The sensitivity level dictates the required security controls for data protection (encryption, access control, data loss prevention, etc.).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the specific business purpose of the Sinatra application being designed? (This document assumes a general web application scenario).
  - What type of data will the application handle, and what is its sensitivity level? (Assumed potentially sensitive data requiring security measures).
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for the application (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? (Assumed general web security best practices are relevant).
  - What is the organization's risk appetite? (Assumed a moderate risk appetite requiring reasonable security controls).
  - What existing security infrastructure and tools are already in place? (Assumed standard cloud security services and development tools are available).

- Assumptions:
  - The Sinatra application is intended for deployment in a cloud environment.
  - Security is a relevant concern for the application, requiring implementation of security controls.
  - Developers using Sinatra are expected to have some level of security awareness, but may benefit from guidance and automated security tools.
  - The application will handle some level of user data, potentially including sensitive information.
  - A CI/CD pipeline is used for building and deploying the application.
