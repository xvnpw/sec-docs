# Attack Surface Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Sinatra handles route parameters (e.g., `:id`, `*`) to access unauthorized resources or trigger unexpected behavior.
*   **Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra's flexible routing system, while powerful, can be misused if developers don't implement strict validation and sanitization of route parameters.  The use of splat parameters (`*`) and regular expressions in routes increases the potential for unintended matches. This is a *direct* consequence of Sinatra's design.
*   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/*` intended to serve files from a specific directory might be exploited with `/files/../../etc/passwd` to access system files if the splat parameter is not properly sanitized to prevent directory traversal.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or files.
    *   Execution of unintended application logic.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use the most specific route definitions possible.  Avoid overly broad regular expressions or splat parameters.  Rigorously validate *all* route parameters for type, format, length, and allowed values *before* using them.  Use Sinatra's `conditions` to add extra constraints to route matching.  Sanitize input to prevent directory traversal (e.g., using `File.expand_path` and checking against a whitelist of allowed directories).

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into templates by exploiting vulnerabilities in how user input is rendered.
*   **Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra supports various templating engines (ERB, Haml, Slim, etc.). If user input is passed *directly* to the template without proper escaping, it can lead to template injection. While the vulnerability exists within the templating engine, Sinatra's role is in *how* it passes data to these engines, making it a direct contributor. The choice of using `<%= ... %>` in ERB (a common Sinatra practice) is a key factor.
*   **Example:** If a template contains `<%= params[:username] %>` and `username` is not escaped, an attacker could submit `<%= system('rm -rf /') %>` (or other malicious Ruby code) as the username, potentially leading to server compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data theft or modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* use the appropriate escaping functions provided by the templating engine.  For ERB, use `<%- ... %>` (which escapes by default) or the `h` (or `escape_html`) helper function: `<%= h(params[:username]) %>`.  Prefer templating engines that auto-escape by default (like Slim or Haml).  *Never* use `<%= ... %>` with unescaped user input.  Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact.

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation (if `enable :sessions` is used)](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation__if__enable_sessions__is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers set a known session ID in a victim's browser and then hijack the session after the victim authenticates.
*   **Sinatra Contribution:** Sinatra's built-in session management (`enable :sessions`) uses cookies. If the session ID is not regenerated after authentication, the application is vulnerable. This is a *direct* consequence of using Sinatra's built-in session feature without proper handling.
*   **Example:** An attacker sets a cookie with `session_id=123` in a victim's browser.  The victim then logs into the application.  If the application doesn't change the session ID, the attacker can use the same cookie (`session_id=123`) to access the victim's account.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* regenerate the session ID after a successful login.  In Sinatra, this can be done by calling `session.clear` *before* setting any new session data after authentication.  Consider using a more robust session management solution.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to code execution or other attacks.
*   **Sinatra Contribution:** While Sinatra doesn't *provide* file upload handling, it *doesn't restrict it either*.  The framework's permissiveness, allowing developers to implement any file handling logic (or lack thereof), directly contributes to this attack surface.  It's the *absence* of built-in secure handling that's the issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP shell script disguised as a JPEG image. If the server is configured to execute PHP files and the uploaded file is placed in a web-accessible directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution.
    *   Server compromise.
    *   Data theft or modification.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Validate file types using more than just the file extension. Check the file's "magic number" or MIME type.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on file size.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files *outside* the web root.
        *   **File Renaming:** Rename uploaded files to prevent directory traversal.
        *   **Malware Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malware.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP.
        *   **Consider Offloading:** Use a dedicated file storage service (e.g., AWS S3).
