# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Route Parameter Injection in Sinatra

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the vulnerabilities associated with route parameter injection in a Sinatra-based application, specifically focusing on the "Bypass Authentication/Authorization" and "Code Injection" sub-paths.  The goal is to identify potential attack vectors, assess their likelihood and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses on the following attack tree path:

*   **1.1 Route Parameter Injection**
    *   **1.1.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization**
    *   **1.1.3 Code Injection**

The analysis will consider the context of a Sinatra application and its common usage patterns.  It will *not* cover other potential attack vectors outside of this specific path, such as SQL injection (unless directly related to route parameter misuse), cross-site scripting (XSS), or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  It assumes the application uses standard Sinatra features and does not incorporate highly unusual or custom routing mechanisms.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it with concrete examples and scenarios relevant to Sinatra.
2.  **Code Review Simulation:** We will simulate a code review process, identifying vulnerable code patterns and suggesting secure alternatives.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** We will assess the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty of each identified vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  For each vulnerability, we will provide specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Tooling Suggestion:** We will suggest tools that can help identify and prevent these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 1.1 Route Parameter Injection

**General Description:**  Sinatra uses route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`) to capture values from the URL.  If these parameters are not handled securely, attackers can inject malicious input, leading to various vulnerabilities.

### 1.1.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization

**Description:**  This vulnerability occurs when the application logic incorrectly relies on route parameters for authentication or authorization checks.  The attacker manipulates the parameter to gain access to resources they should not be able to access.

**Sinatra-Specific Examples:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Example 1):**

    ```ruby
    get '/user/:id/profile' do
      user = User.find_by(id: params[:id]) # Directly using params[:id]
      if user
        erb :profile, locals: { user: user }
      else
        halt 404, 'User not found'
      end
    end
    ```

    *   **Attack:** An attacker could change the `:id` in the URL (e.g., `/user/123/profile` to `/user/456/profile`) to potentially view the profile of user 456, even if they are only authorized to view user 123's profile.  The application only checks if a user *exists* with that ID, not if the *current user* is authorized to see it.

*   **Vulnerable Code (Example 2 - Session Hijacking Potential):**

    ```ruby
    get '/admin/:session_id' do
      if params[:session_id] == 'admin_session_123' # Hardcoded, VERY BAD
        erb :admin_panel
      else
        halt 403, 'Forbidden'
      end
    end
    ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker who somehow obtains the `admin_session_123` string (e.g., through network sniffing, XSS, or social engineering) can directly access the admin panel by crafting the URL. This is a simplified, extreme example, but it illustrates the danger of using route parameters for authentication without proper session management.

**Detailed Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers often use route parameters for resource identification, and it's easy to overlook proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, account takeover, or even complete system compromise (depending on the accessed resources).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  The attacker only needs to modify the URL, which is trivial.  Finding a vulnerable endpoint might require some reconnaissance.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Basic understanding of URLs and HTTP requests is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Logs might show unusual access patterns, but it can be difficult to distinguish malicious requests from legitimate ones without proper context.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Implement Robust Authorization:** Use a dedicated authorization library like Pundit or CanCanCan.  These libraries provide a structured way to define authorization rules based on user roles and permissions, *separate* from route parameters.

    ```ruby
    # Example with Pundit
    get '/user/:id/profile' do
      user = User.find(params[:id]) # Use find to raise error if not found
      authorize user, :show? # Pundit policy check
      erb :profile, locals: { user: user }
    end
    ```

2.  **Use Session Management:**  Authenticate users and store their identity in a secure session.  Do *not* rely on route parameters for authentication.  Sinatra has built-in session support (using cookies by default), and you should use it properly.

    ```ruby
    enable :sessions
    set :session_secret, 'super secret' # Use a strong, random secret!

    post '/login' do
      user = User.authenticate(params[:username], params[:password])
      if user
        session[:user_id] = user.id
        redirect '/dashboard'
      else
        # Handle login failure
      end
    end

    get '/dashboard' do
      halt 401, 'Unauthorized' unless session[:user_id]
      user = User.find(session[:user_id])
      # ...
    end
    ```

3.  **Validate and Sanitize Input:** Even with authorization in place, always validate and sanitize route parameters.  Ensure they conform to expected data types and formats.

    ```ruby
    get '/user/:id/profile' do
      # Validate that :id is an integer
      unless params[:id] =~ /^\d+$/
        halt 400, 'Invalid user ID'
      end
      user = User.find(params[:id])
      authorize user, :show?
      erb :profile, locals: { user: user }
    end
    ```
4.  **Use `find` instead of `find_by` (with appropriate error handling):** In the first vulnerable example, `User.find(params[:id])` would raise an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception if the user with the given ID doesn't exist. This is generally preferred over `find_by`, which returns `nil`, as it forces you to handle the "not found" case explicitly and prevents accidental exposure.

### 1.1.3 Code Injection

**Description:** This is a *critical* vulnerability where the attacker injects arbitrary code into a route parameter, and the application executes that code.  This is most likely to occur if the application uses `eval`, `send`, or similar methods with user-supplied input.

**Sinatra-Specific Examples:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Example 1 - `eval`):**

    ```ruby
    get '/calculate/:expression' do
      result = eval(params[:expression]) # EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
      "The result is: #{result}"
    end
    ```

    *   **Attack:** An attacker could send a request like `/calculate/system('rm -rf /')`.  This would execute the `rm -rf /` command on the server, potentially deleting the entire filesystem.  Even less destructive commands could expose sensitive information or create backdoors.

*   **Vulnerable Code (Example 2 - `send`):**

    ```ruby
    get '/user/:id/:action' do
      user = User.find(params[:id])
      user.send(params[:action]) # EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
    end
    ```

    *   **Attack:** An attacker could send a request like `/user/1/destroy`. If the `User` model has a `destroy` method (which it likely does in an ORM like ActiveRecord), this would delete the user.  The attacker could also call *any* other public method on the `User` object, potentially leading to data leakage or other unintended consequences.

**Detailed Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Low (but Very High if misused).  Good developers should know to avoid `eval` and `send` with untrusted input.  However, mistakes happen, and legacy code might contain such vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete server compromise, data loss, and arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload, but this is often straightforward once a vulnerable endpoint is found.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.  Requires understanding of Ruby and the target application's code.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Security tools might detect the use of `eval` or `send`, but it can be difficult to determine if they are being used with user-supplied input without careful code analysis.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Avoid `eval`, `send`, and similar functions with user input:** This is the most important mitigation.  There are almost always safer alternatives.  Refactor your code to avoid these functions entirely when dealing with route parameters or any other user-supplied data.

2.  **Whitelisting (if `send` is absolutely necessary):** If you *must* use `send` (which is highly discouraged), use a strict whitelist to control which methods can be called.

    ```ruby
    ALLOWED_ACTIONS = [:profile, :settings, :logout]

    get '/user/:id/:action' do
      user = User.find(params[:id])
      if ALLOWED_ACTIONS.include?(params[:action].to_sym)
        user.send(params[:action].to_sym)
      else
        halt 403, 'Forbidden'
      end
    end
    ```
    *Even with whitelisting, consider if there is a better approach.*

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Even if you avoid `eval` and `send`, rigorously validate and sanitize all route parameters.  This can help prevent other types of injection attacks.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

## 3. Tooling Suggestions

*   **Static Code Analysis (SAST):** Tools like Brakeman (specifically designed for Ruby on Rails, but can be used with Sinatra) can scan your codebase for potential vulnerabilities, including the use of `eval` and `send` with user input. RuboCop, with security-focused extensions, can also be helpful.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can be used to test your running application for vulnerabilities, including route parameter injection. These tools can send malicious requests and analyze the responses to identify potential weaknesses.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can help block malicious requests before they reach your application.  They can be configured with rules to detect and prevent common injection attacks.
*   **Security Linters:** Use linters like `rubocop-rspec` and configure them to enforce secure coding practices.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** RASP solutions embed within the application runtime and can detect and prevent attacks in real-time.

## Conclusion

Route parameter injection is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating consequences in Sinatra applications. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust authorization and input validation, and avoiding dangerous functions like `eval` and `send`, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.  Regular security testing and the use of appropriate security tools are essential for maintaining a secure application. The combination of secure coding practices, proactive security measures, and continuous monitoring is crucial for protecting against this and other web application vulnerabilities.
