# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Routes:** Examine all routes defined in your Sinatra application (typically in your main application file or separate route files).
    2.  **Identify Overly Permissive Routes:** Look for routes using broad regular expressions (e.g., `/.*/`), `splat` parameters (`*`) without sufficient constraints, or routes that accept a wide range of input types.
    3.  **Refactor to Specificity:**  Rewrite overly permissive routes to be as specific as possible.
        *   Use literal paths whenever feasible (e.g., `/users/profile` instead of `/users/:action`).
        *   Constrain parameters with regular expressions that match the expected input format (e.g., `/users/:id<\\d+>` for numeric IDs).
        *   If using `splat`, ensure subsequent validation and sanitization are extremely robust.
    4.  **Route Ordering:** Ensure more specific routes are defined *before* less specific routes in your application file.
    5.  **Document Routes:** Clearly document the purpose and expected input for each route.
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular reviews of all routes to ensure they remain secure and necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Route Hijacking (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting URLs that unexpectedly match routes and access unintended functionality or data.  This is *directly* related to Sinatra's routing mechanism.
    *   **Unintended Data Exposure (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data through overly broad routes, a consequence of Sinatra's flexible routing.
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to manipulate route parameters, although input validation is still crucial.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Route Exhaustion (Low to Medium Severity):**  Overly permissive routes *can* contribute to DoS in specific Sinatra setups.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Route Hijacking:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Unintended Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **DoS via Route Exhaustion:**  Provides some mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Basic routes are defined with literal paths, but some routes using `:id` parameters lack type constraints (e.g., `/items/:id`).  Route ordering is generally correct.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing regular expression constraints on several `:id` parameters (e.g., `/items/:id`, `/comments/:id`).  These should be updated to `/items/:id<\\d+>` and `/comments/:id<\\d+>`, assuming IDs are numeric.
    *   Lack of comprehensive route documentation.
    *   No formal route auditing process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Template Engine Auto-Escaping and Contextual Escaping](./mitigation_strategies/template_engine_auto-escaping_and_contextual_escaping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Templating Engine:** Determine which templating engine is used with Sinatra (ERB, Haml, Slim, etc.).
    2.  **Verify Auto-Escaping:** Check the templating engine's documentation and your Sinatra application's configuration to ensure auto-escaping is enabled by default.  This is a configuration step *within* the Sinatra context.
    3.  **Contextual Escaping Review:** Examine all templates used *within your Sinatra application* and identify areas where data is inserted.
    4.  **Apply Context-Specific Escaping:**  If data is inserted into a non-HTML context (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, URL) *within a Sinatra template*, use the appropriate escaping functions for that context.
    5.  **Avoid Direct User Input in Template Strings (ERB Specific):** If using ERB *with Sinatra*, *never* construct template strings directly from user input.  Always pass data as variables to the template. This is a Sinatra-specific best practice.
    6.  **Regular Code Reviews:** Include template security as part of code reviews, focusing on how Sinatra integrates with the templating engine.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts via Sinatra's template rendering.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):**  Mitigates RCE risks that can arise from template injection *within Sinatra*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **RCE:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  ERB is used with auto-escaping enabled (within the Sinatra configuration).  Basic HTML escaping is generally handled correctly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of consistent contextual escaping.  Some JavaScript sections within templates rendered by Sinatra are not properly escaped.
    *   No formal code review process specifically focused on template security within the Sinatra application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Error Handling (Sinatra `show_exceptions` and Custom Error Pages)](./mitigation_strategies/proper_error_handling__sinatra__show_exceptions__and_custom_error_pages_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom Error Pages:** *Within your Sinatra application*, define custom error pages for common HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500). These pages should be user-friendly and not reveal sensitive information. This utilizes Sinatra's `error` block.
    2.  **`show_exceptions` Setting:** In your Sinatra application's configuration, set `show_exceptions` to `false` (or `:after_handler` if you need to log exceptions) for the production environment.  This is a *direct Sinatra setting*.
    3.  **Error Handling Review:** Regularly review your Sinatra error handling code (specifically the `error` blocks) to ensure consistency and prevent information leakage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive information (stack traces, etc.) from being revealed in error messages *generated by Sinatra*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic custom error pages are in place for 404 errors within the Sinatra app. `show_exceptions` is set to `true` (this is a critical issue within the Sinatra configuration).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `show_exceptions` needs to be set to `false` (or `:after_handler`) for the production environment *in the Sinatra configuration*.
    *   Custom error pages are missing for other error codes (e.g., 500) *within the Sinatra application*.
    *   No formal review process for Sinatra's error handling.
