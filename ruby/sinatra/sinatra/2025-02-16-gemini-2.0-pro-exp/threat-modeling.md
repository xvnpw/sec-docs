# Threat Model Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Threat: [Route Ambiguity Exploitation](./threats/route_ambiguity_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that matches multiple, overlapping routes defined in the Sinatra application. The attacker aims to trigger a less secure or unintended route handler, bypassing intended security controls.  This leverages Sinatra's "first match wins" routing behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication/authorization bypass, access to unintended functionality, potential information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sinatra's routing mechanism (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc., route definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with precise and non-overlapping patterns.  Prioritize more specific routes.
        *   Use explicit route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`) instead of wildcard or optional segments where possible.
        *   Thoroughly test all possible route combinations, including edge cases and invalid input.
        *   Employ a consistent naming convention for routes to improve clarity and reduce ambiguity.
        *   Use a route visualizer or debugger to understand route precedence and matching behavior.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Routes](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_routes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious input string designed to exploit a poorly written regular expression used in a Sinatra *route definition*.  The attacker's input triggers catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, causing excessive CPU consumption and a denial of service. This is specific to how Sinatra allows regex in routes.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Affected Component:** Sinatra's route definition mechanism, specifically when using regular expressions in routes (e.g., `get %r{/foo/(.*)}`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid complex regular expressions in routes whenever feasible.  Prefer simpler matching techniques.
        *   If regular expressions are unavoidable, meticulously review them for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities (nested quantifiers, alternations).
        *   Use tools specifically designed to test for ReDoS susceptibility.
        *   Implement timeouts for regular expression matching at the application level (since Sinatra doesn't have built-in regex timeouts).  Use the Ruby `timeout` library.
        *   Consider using a safer regular expression engine if one is available and compatible.

## Threat: [Parameter Pollution via Splat Parameters](./threats/parameter_pollution_via_splat_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL to inject unexpected values into Sinatra's *splat parameters* (`*`) within a route.  The attacker might try to override other parameters or inject malicious data that is then used unsafely by the application. This is a direct consequence of Sinatra's splat parameter feature.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security checks, manipulating application behavior, potential code injection (if splat parameters are used in an unsafe manner, such as directly in database queries or system commands).
    *   **Affected Component:** Sinatra's splat parameter feature (`*` in route definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of splat parameters.  Favor named parameters or more specific route patterns.
        *   If splat parameters are necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize the captured values *before* using them in any sensitive operations.
        *   Be especially cautious when using splat parameters in combination with other parameters.  Implement strict input validation.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits an incorrect ordering of middleware *within the Sinatra application*.  If security-related middleware (authentication, authorization) is loaded *after* middleware that processes user input or accesses resources, the attacker can bypass those security controls. This is directly related to how Sinatra handles middleware.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sinatra's middleware stack (`use` statements).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan the order of middleware.  Security-related middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) should generally be loaded *before* middleware that handles application logic or accesses resources.
        *   Document the middleware order and the reasoning behind it.
        *   Thoroughly test the application to ensure that middleware is functioning as intended and that the order is correct.

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

* **Description:** If user input is used to dynamically construct template names or paths that are passed to `erb`, `haml` or other functions, an attacker might be able to inject malicious template code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure.
    * **Affected Component:** Templating engines used with Sinatra and the application logic that determines which template to render, specifically `erb`, `haml` or other functions that accept template path.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input to construct template names or paths.
        *   If dynamic template selection is necessary, use a whitelist of allowed template names.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user input used in template selection.
