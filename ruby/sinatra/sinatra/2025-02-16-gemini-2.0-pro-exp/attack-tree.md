## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Route Parameter Injection [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_route_parameter_injection__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters to inject malicious input, bypassing security controls or executing arbitrary code.
    *   **1.1.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  If application logic relies on route parameters for authentication or authorization checks, an attacker can manipulate these parameters to gain unauthorized access.  For example, if a route `/user/:id/profile` determines access based solely on the `:id` parameter, an attacker could change the `:id` to access another user's profile.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High to Very High
        *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Low to Medium
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:*  Rigorous input validation and sanitization.  Use a dedicated authorization library.  Avoid relying solely on route parameters for security decisions.
    *   **1.1.3 Code Injection [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* If route parameters are used directly in code evaluation functions like `eval` or `send`, an attacker can inject arbitrary code to be executed by the server. This is extremely dangerous.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (but Very High if misused)
        *   *Impact:* Very High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Medium to High
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
        *   *Mitigation:*  **Absolutely avoid** using user-supplied input in `eval`, `send`, or any similar function.  If unavoidable, use extreme caution and rigorous whitelisting.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Attacker exploits a route that was intended to be internal-only [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_attacker_exploits_a_route_that_was_intended_to_be_internal-only__high_risk_.md)

*   *Description:*  Routes designed for internal use (e.g., administrative functions, debugging endpoints) are accidentally exposed to the public internet.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* Medium to High
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low to Medium
    *   *Mitigation:*  Use middleware or before filters to enforce strict access control on sensitive routes.  Clearly document and regularly audit route visibility.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Vulnerable Third-Party Extension [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_vulnerable_third-party_extension__high_risk_.md)

*   *Description:*  Sinatra extensions, like any third-party code, can contain vulnerabilities or introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **2.1.1 Extension contains known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  The extension has publicly known vulnerabilities (e.g., listed in CVE databases).
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low to Medium
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low
        *   *Mitigation:*  Keep all extensions up-to-date.  Use a dependency checker (e.g., Bundler-audit, Snyk).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Misuse of Sinatra Helpers](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_misuse_of_sinatra_helpers.md)

    *   **2.2.1 Insecure use of `send_file` (e.g., path traversal) [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  The `send_file` helper is used without proper validation of the filename and path, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server.  For example, an attacker might use input like `../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:*  Strictly validate and sanitize the filename and path provided to `send_file`.  Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions.  Ensure files are served from a designated, restricted directory.
    *   **2.2.3 Insecure Session Management (if using Sinatra's built-in session handling) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Weaknesses in session management can lead to session hijacking or fixation.
        *   **2.2.3.1 Session Fixation [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:*  An attacker sets a user's session ID to a known value, allowing them to hijack the session after the user authenticates.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Mitigation:*  Regenerate the session ID after successful authentication.  Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration Errors [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_errors__high_risk_.md)

*   *Description:* Misconfigurations in the application's environment or server setup can expose vulnerabilities.
    *   **3.1 Development Mode in Production [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  Running the application in development mode in a production environment exposes detailed error messages and debugging tools, potentially leaking sensitive information or allowing code execution.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Low to Medium (information leakage), High to Very High (code execution)
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Very Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low
        *   *Mitigation:*  **Always** set `RACK_ENV` to `production` in production environments.
    *   **3.2 Insecure Session Secret [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  Using a default, weak, or exposed session secret allows attackers to forge session cookies and hijack user sessions.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:*  **Always** use a strong, randomly generated session secret.  Store the secret securely (e.g., environment variables).  Rotate the secret regularly.
    *   **3.3 Exposure of Sensitive Files**
        *   *Description:* Sensitive files, such as configuration files or source code, are accidentally made accessible to the public.
        *   **3.3.1 `.env` files or other configuration files are accidentally served. [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* Configuration files containing secrets (API keys, database credentials) are exposed.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low to Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low
            *   *Mitigation:* Configure the web server to deny access to sensitive files and directories. Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets to the repository.
        *   **3.3.2 Source code is exposed due to misconfiguration [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* The application's source code is directly accessible, revealing the application's logic and potentially exposing vulnerabilities.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low
            *   *Mitigation:* Ensure the web server's document root is correctly configured.
