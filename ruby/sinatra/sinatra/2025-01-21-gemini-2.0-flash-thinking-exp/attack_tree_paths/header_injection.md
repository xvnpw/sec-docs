## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Header Injection (Sinatra Application)

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Header Injection" attack path within the context of a Sinatra web application. We will define the objective, scope, and methodology for this analysis before diving into the specifics of the attack.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand how a header injection attack can be executed against a Sinatra application, identify potential vulnerabilities within the framework that could facilitate such an attack, and assess the potential impact of a successful exploitation. We aim to provide actionable insights for development teams to mitigate this risk.

### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus specifically on the "Header Injection" attack path. The scope includes:

* **Sinatra Framework:**  We will analyze how Sinatra handles HTTP headers and how user-controlled input can influence them.
* **Common Sinatra Usage Patterns:** We will consider typical ways developers might set headers in Sinatra applications, including direct manipulation of the `headers` hash, using helper methods like `redirect`, and setting cookies.
* **Server-Side Perspective:** The analysis will primarily focus on vulnerabilities within the Sinatra application code and its interaction with the underlying web server (e.g., Rack).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Header Injection

**Understanding Header Injection:**

Header injection is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can control HTTP response headers sent by the server. By injecting malicious data into these headers, attackers can manipulate the behavior of the client's browser or other intermediaries. This can lead to various security issues, including:

* **Session Hijacking:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers to overwrite or set malicious session cookies.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting headers like `Content-Type` or custom headers that might be interpreted by the browser in a way that allows script execution.
* **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that influence caching behavior, potentially serving malicious content to other users.
* **Open Redirect:** Injecting `Location` headers to redirect users to attacker-controlled websites.

**Sinatra Header Handling:**

Sinatra provides several ways to manipulate HTTP response headers:

* **`headers` Hash:**  The most direct way is through the `headers` hash within a route handler. For example:
   ```ruby
   get '/custom_header' do
     headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Some Value'
     'Hello, world!'
   end
   ```
* **Response Object:**  Sinatra uses a Rack response object. You can access and modify its headers directly:
   ```ruby
   get '/response_object' do
     response.headers['X-Another-Header'] = 'Another Value'
     'Hello again!'
   end
   ```
* **Helper Methods:**  Sinatra provides helper methods that implicitly set headers, such as:
    * `redirect(uri)`: Sets the `Location` header.
    * `content_type(type)`: Sets the `Content-Type` header.
    * `set_cookie(name, value, options = {})`: Sets the `Set-Cookie` header.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Sinatra:**

The primary vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is directly or indirectly used to set HTTP headers without proper sanitization or validation. Here are some common scenarios:

* **Direct Header Manipulation with User Input:** If user input is directly used to set a header value, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers.
   ```ruby
   get '/set_custom_header' do
     header_value = params[:value]
     headers['X-Custom'] = header_value  # VULNERABLE!
     "Setting custom header: #{header_value}"
   end
   ```
   An attacker could send a request like `/set_custom_header?value=Malicious-Header: evil_value%0aAnother-Evil-Header: more_evil`

* **Unsafe Redirects:** If the redirect URL is taken directly from user input without validation, an attacker can inject malicious headers through the `Location` header.
   ```ruby
   get '/redirect_me' do
     redirect_url = params[:url]
     redirect redirect_url  # VULNERABLE!
   end
   ```
   An attacker could send a request like `/redirect_me?url=https://evil.com%0aMalicious-Header: evil_value`  This might result in the server sending a response with the injected header *before* the `Location` header.

* **Cookie Manipulation:** While `set_cookie` offers some protection, if the cookie *value* is derived from unsanitized user input, attackers might be able to inject additional cookie attributes or even set entirely new cookies.
   ```ruby
   get '/set_user_cookie' do
     username = params[:username]
     set_cookie('user', username) # Potentially vulnerable if username is not sanitized
     "Setting user cookie for: #{username}"
   end
   ```
   While not a direct header injection in the same way as `Location`, manipulating cookies through user input can have similar security implications.

**Analyzing Attack Vectors:**

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious HTTP requests that include newline characters (`\r\n` or `%0d%0a`) to separate header lines and inject their own headers.

* **Injecting Custom Headers:**  As shown in the direct header manipulation example, attackers can inject arbitrary headers and their values.
* **Overwriting Existing Headers:**  Attackers might try to overwrite critical headers like `Content-Type` to trigger XSS if the application doesn't properly set it later.
* **Setting Malicious Cookies:**  Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers to hijack sessions or track users.
* **Performing Open Redirects with Extra Headers:** Injecting headers before the `Location` header in a redirect response.

**Assessing Impact:**

The impact of a successful header injection attack can be significant:

* **Security Breaches:** Session hijacking can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts. XSS via header manipulation can compromise user data and actions.
* **Data Manipulation:** Cache poisoning can lead to serving incorrect or malicious content to users.
* **Operational Disruption:**  Injecting headers that cause browser errors or unexpected behavior can disrupt the user experience.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Exploitation of such vulnerabilities can damage the reputation of the application and the organization.

**Developing Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent header injection vulnerabilities in Sinatra applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before using it to set header values. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, expected characters or patterns.
    * **Blacklisting:**  Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters like newline characters (`\r`, `\n`).
* **Avoid Direct Header Manipulation with User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input to set header values. If necessary, use a predefined set of allowed values and map user input to these safe options.
* **Secure Redirects:**  Never directly use user-provided URLs in `redirect` calls. Maintain a list of allowed redirect destinations or use a secure token-based approach.
* **Use Sinatra's Built-in Helpers Securely:**  Be mindful of how helper methods like `set_cookie` are used and ensure that cookie values derived from user input are properly sanitized.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities, even if header injection occurs.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Testing and Verification:**

Header injection vulnerabilities can be identified through:

* **Manual Testing:**  Crafting HTTP requests with injected newline characters and observing the server's response headers. Tools like `curl` or browser developer tools can be used for this.
* **Automated Security Scanners (SAST/DAST):**  Static and dynamic analysis tools can help identify potential header injection points in the code.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engaging security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

Header injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant security implications for Sinatra applications. By understanding how Sinatra handles headers and implementing robust input validation and sanitization techniques, development teams can effectively mitigate this risk. Prioritizing secure coding practices and conducting regular security assessments are crucial for building resilient and secure web applications.
