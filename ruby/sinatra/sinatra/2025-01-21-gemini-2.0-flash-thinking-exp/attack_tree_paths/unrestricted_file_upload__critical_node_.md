### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unrestricted File Upload

**Attack Tree Node:** Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient restrictions on the type or content of the file.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This seemingly simple vulnerability can have severe consequences. The lack of restrictions on file uploads opens the door to a wide range of attacks. Here's a deeper look:

**4.1. Attack Vectors:**

* **Malicious Executable Upload:** Attackers can upload executable files (e.g., `.exe`, `.sh`, `.php`, `.py`, `.jar`) and potentially execute them on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the server allows execution of PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can then access and control the server remotely.
* **Web Shell Upload:**  Even if direct execution is prevented, attackers can upload web shells (scripts that provide remote command execution capabilities). These shells can be written in various languages supported by the server (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby).
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a Python script that listens on a specific port and executes commands received through that port.
* **HTML File Upload (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):** Uploading malicious HTML files containing JavaScript can lead to stored XSS attacks. When other users access or view these uploaded files, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads an HTML file with JavaScript that steals the session cookie of any user who views the file.
* **Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading extremely large files can consume significant server resources (disk space, bandwidth), potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker repeatedly uploads multi-gigabyte files, filling up the server's storage and causing it to crash.
* **File Overwriting/Manipulation:** If the application doesn't properly handle file naming and storage, attackers might be able to overwrite existing critical files or manipulate application data by uploading files with specific names.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a file named `config.yml` with malicious configurations, potentially compromising the application's settings.
* **Bypassing File Type Restrictions (MIME Type Spoofing):** Attackers can manipulate the MIME type of a malicious file to bypass basic client-side or even some server-side checks.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell with a MIME type set to `image/jpeg` to trick a naive server-side check.
* **Information Disclosure:** Uploading files with specific content can be used to probe the server's environment or reveal sensitive information.
    * **Scenario:** An attacker uploads a file containing specific keywords or patterns to see if the server's error messages reveal information about its internal workings.

**4.2. Potential Impact:**

The impact of an unrestricted file upload vulnerability can be catastrophic:

* **Complete Server Compromise:**  Execution of malicious code can grant attackers full control over the server.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive data stored on the server or accessible through the application.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can upload malicious HTML files to deface the website.
* **Malware Distribution:** The server can be used to host and distribute malware to other users.
* **Denial of Service:**  Resource exhaustion can make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust associated with the application and the organization.
* **Legal and Financial Consequences:** Data breaches and service disruptions can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions.

**4.3. Technical Deep Dive (Sinatra Context):**

Sinatra, being a lightweight framework, provides basic mechanisms for handling file uploads but doesn't enforce strict security measures by default. Typically, file uploads in Sinatra are accessed through the `params` hash.

```ruby
post '/upload' do
  tempfile = params['file'][:tempfile]
  filename = params['file'][:filename]

  # Insecure: Directly saving the uploaded file without validation
  File.open("./uploads/#{filename}", 'wb') do |f|
    f.write tempfile.read
  end
  "File uploaded successfully!"
end
```

In the above example, the code directly saves the uploaded file to the `./uploads` directory without any validation. This is a classic example of an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

**Key Weaknesses in the Default Sinatra Handling (without developer intervention):**

* **No inherent file type validation:** Sinatra doesn't automatically check the file extension or MIME type.
* **No content scanning:**  Sinatra doesn't inspect the content of the uploaded file for malicious code.
* **Direct file saving:**  The example directly saves the file with the user-provided filename, which can be manipulated.
* **Lack of access control:**  The uploaded files might be accessible directly through the web server if the `./uploads` directory is publicly accessible.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of unrestricted file uploads in a Sinatra application, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strict File Type Validation (Server-Side):**
    * **Whitelist allowed extensions:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).
    * **Verify MIME type:** Check the `Content-Type` header of the uploaded file, but be aware that this can be spoofed.
    * **Magic number validation:**  Inspect the file's header (magic number) to reliably identify the file type, regardless of the extension or MIME type. Libraries like `file` (or Ruby gems that wrap its functionality) can be used for this.
* **Content Scanning:**
    * **Integrate with an Anti-Virus (AV) scanner:** Scan uploaded files for known malware signatures before saving them.
* **Filename Sanitization:**
    * **Generate unique filenames:** Avoid using the user-provided filename directly. Generate a unique, random filename or use a timestamp-based naming convention.
    * **Remove or replace special characters:** Sanitize the filename to prevent path traversal attacks or issues with the file system.
* **Secure File Storage:**
    * **Store uploaded files outside the web root:** Prevent direct access to uploaded files via HTTP.
    * **Implement access controls:**  Use appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to uploaded files.
    * **Consider using a dedicated storage service:** Services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage offer secure and scalable storage solutions.
* **Limit File Size:**
    * **Implement a maximum file size limit:** Prevent attackers from uploading excessively large files that can cause resource exhaustion.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Validate other relevant input fields:** If there are other fields associated with the file upload, ensure they are properly validated to prevent related attacks.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Configure CSP headers:**  Mitigate the impact of uploaded HTML files by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Periodically assess the application's security:** Identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including file upload issues.

**4.5. Example Mitigation (Illustrative Sinatra Code):**

```ruby
require 'filemagic'

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.pdf']
UPLOAD_DIR = './uploads'
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 1024 * 1024 # 1MB

post '/upload' do
  file = params['file']
  if file && file[:tempfile] && file[:filename]
    filename = file[:filename]
    tempfile = file[:tempfile]

    # 1. Validate File Extension
    unless ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS.include?(File.extname(filename).downcase)
      return "Error: Invalid file extension."
    end

    # 2. Validate File Size
    if tempfile.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE
      return "Error: File size exceeds the limit."
    end

    # 3. Validate Magic Number (More Robust Type Checking)
    fm = FileMagic.mime
    mime_type = fm.file(tempfile.path)
    unless mime_type.start_with?('image/') || mime_type == 'application/pdf'
      return "Error: Invalid file content."
    end

    # 4. Sanitize Filename and Generate Unique Name
    sanitized_filename = SecureRandom.uuid + File.extname(filename).downcase
    filepath = File.join(UPLOAD_DIR, sanitized_filename)

    # 5. Save the File
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(UPLOAD_DIR) unless Dir.exist?(UPLOAD_DIR)
    File.open(filepath, 'wb') { |f| f.write tempfile.read }

    "File uploaded successfully!"
  else
    "Error: No file uploaded."
  end
end
```

**Note:** This is a simplified example. Integrating with an AV scanner and more robust error handling would be necessary in a production environment.
