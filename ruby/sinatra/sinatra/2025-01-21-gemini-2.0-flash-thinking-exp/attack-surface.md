# Attack Surface Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Attack Surface: [Route Overlapping and Precedence Issues](./attack_surfaces/route_overlapping_and_precedence_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  When multiple routes match a given request path, Sinatra uses the order in which routes are defined to determine which handler is executed. This can lead to unintended handlers being triggered if routes are not carefully ordered, potentially bypassing security checks or exposing unintended functionality.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra's route matching mechanism relies on the order of definition. It processes routes sequentially and executes the first matching route.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        get '/admin' do
          # Admin dashboard - requires authentication
        end

        get '/:page' do
          # Generic page handler
        end
        ```
        If a user navigates to `/admin`, the second, more general route might be matched first if the order is incorrect, bypassing the intended authentication for the admin dashboard.
    *   **Impact:** Access control bypass, unintended functionality execution, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define more specific routes before more general ones.
        *   Use route constraints (e.g., regular expressions) to make routes more distinct.
        *   Thoroughly review route definitions to ensure intended behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection via Route Segments](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_via_route_segments.md)

*   **Description:** When capturing parameters from route segments (e.g., `/users/:id`), developers might directly use these parameters in database queries or system commands without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra provides a straightforward way to define and access parameters from route segments.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        get '/users/:id' do
          user_id = params[:id]
          # Potentially vulnerable SQL query
          users = DB.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{user_id}")
        end
        ```
        An attacker could send a request like `/users/1 OR 1=1` to potentially bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when interacting with databases.
        *   Sanitize and validate all input received from route parameters.
        *   Avoid directly embedding route parameters into system commands.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (if using templating engines)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__if_using_templating_engines_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, it can lead to server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra integrates with various templating engines (like ERB, Haml). If these engines are used insecurely, it introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        get '/hello/:name' do
          @name = params[:name]
          erb "<h1>Hello, <%= @name %></h1>" # Vulnerable if @name is not sanitized
        end
        ```
        An attacker could send a request like `/hello/<%= system('whoami') %>` to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always escape user-provided data** before embedding it in templates.
        *   Use templating engines with auto-escaping features enabled.
        *   Avoid allowing users to control template content directly.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_output.md)

*   **Description:** Even with templating engines, if output escaping is not correctly implemented or if developers bypass escaping mechanisms, user-provided data displayed in templates can contain malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra's rendering of templates makes it responsible for outputting content to the user's browser.
    *   **Example:** Displaying unsanitized user comments on a page.
    *   **Impact:** Account hijacking, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure proper output encoding and escaping** in templates.
        *   Use templating engines with strong auto-escaping capabilities.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Cookie Configuration (using Rack's session management)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_cookie_configuration__using_rack's_session_management_.md)

*   **Description:** Sinatra uses Rack's session management. If session cookies are not configured with appropriate security flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), they can be vulnerable to interception or manipulation.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra relies on Rack for session management, and developers need to configure session options correctly.
    *   **Example:**  A missing `HttpOnly` flag allows JavaScript to access the session cookie, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure session cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags.
        *   Use a strong session secret.
        *   Consider using secure session storage mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation (using Rack's session management)](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation__using_rack's_session_management_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application doesn't regenerate session IDs after a successful login, an attacker might be able to fix a user's session ID and then trick the user into authenticating with that ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra's session management (through Rack) needs to be used correctly to prevent session fixation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a session ID to a user, and after the user logs in, the attacker can use that same session ID to access the user's account.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regenerate the session ID after successful authentication.**
        *   Invalidate old session IDs after login.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering Issues](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_issues.md)

*   **Description:** The order in which middleware is applied in a Sinatra application is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security bypasses or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sinatra allows developers to define the order of middleware execution.
    *   **Example:** Placing an authentication middleware after a middleware that processes request data could allow unauthenticated requests to be processed.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypasses, unintended functionality execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and define the order of middleware execution.
        *   Ensure that security-related middleware is applied early in the request processing pipeline.
