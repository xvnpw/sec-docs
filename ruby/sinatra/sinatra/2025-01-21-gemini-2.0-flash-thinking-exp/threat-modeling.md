# Threat Model Analysis for sinatra/sinatra

## Threat: [Route Hijacking due to Incorrect Route Ordering](./threats/route_hijacking_due_to_incorrect_route_ordering.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft a URL that, due to the order of route definitions in the Sinatra application, matches a more general route instead of the intended specific route. This could allow them to bypass authentication checks, access unintended resources, or trigger different application logic than expected.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypassing security controls, potential data manipulation or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` - specifically the route matching mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define routes from most specific to most general.
* Utilize route constraints (e.g., regular expressions) to ensure precise matching.
* Regularly review and test route definitions to prevent unintended overlaps.

## Threat: [Path Traversal through Unvalidated Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_through_unvalidated_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** If route parameters (e.g., `/files/:filename`) are used to access files or resources without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate the parameter to access files outside the intended directory (e.g., `/files/../../etc/passwd`).

**Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive system files, potential for remote code execution if accessed files are executable.

**Affected Component:** `Sinatra::Base` - route parameter handling and any file system access logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize route parameters used for file system access.
* Use whitelisting of allowed filenames or paths.
* Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths.
* Consider using unique identifiers instead of filenames in URLs.
