## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__critical_node_.md)

* **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of many attackers. Successful execution allows complete control over the server and application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Strict Route Matching [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_strict_route_matching__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Lack of Strict Route Matching [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ambiguous route definitions to trigger unintended handlers. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ambiguous_route_definitions_to_trigger_unintended_handlers___critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit ambiguous route definitions to trigger unintended handlers. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attackers can craft specific URLs that, due to overlapping or poorly defined routes, are processed by a different handler than intended. This can bypass authorization checks or trigger unexpected and potentially dangerous logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Request Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection.md)

* **Header Injection:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or other middleware based on injected headers. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_web_server_or_other_middleware_based_on_injected_headers___critical_n_bfaaf3e1.md)

* **Exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or other middleware based on injected headers. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attackers inject malicious data into HTTP headers. If the application or underlying components don't properly sanitize these headers, it can lead to vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting, cache poisoning, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in middleware that processes these headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Parameter Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of input validation on request parameters. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_request_parameters___critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit lack of input validation on request parameters. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * The application fails to properly validate and sanitize data received through request parameters (e.g., GET or POST).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code or commands that are later executed (e.g., through system calls or unsafe string interpolation). [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_or_commands_that_are_later_executed__e_g___through_system_calls_or_unsafe_stri_141f6c5f.md)

* **Inject malicious code or commands that are later executed (e.g., through system calls or unsafe string interpolation). [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attackers inject malicious code (like shell commands or code snippets) into parameters. If this data is used unsafely, such as in direct system calls or string interpolation, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (if implemented directly in Sinatra) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/file_upload_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_directly_in_sinatra___high-risk_path_.md)

* **File Upload Vulnerabilities (if implemented directly in Sinatra) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__critical_node_.md)

* **Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * The application allows users to upload files without sufficient restrictions on the type or content of the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload executable files to accessible locations. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/upload_executable_files_to_accessible_locations___critical_node_.md)

* **Upload executable files to accessible locations. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attackers upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP, Python scripts) to directories accessible by the web server, allowing them to execute these files and compromise the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during Upload](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_upload.md)

* **Path Traversal during Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attackers manipulate the filename or path during the upload process to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious files in sensitive areas.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Session Management Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Cookie Handling (Default Sinatra Sessions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_cookie_handling__default_sinatra_sessions___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Insecure Session Cookie Handling (Default Sinatra Sessions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of__secure__and__httponly__flags.md)

* **Lack of `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal session cookies via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_session_cookies_via_man-in-the-middle__mitm__or_cross-site_scripting__xss__attacks___critical__78b6cce5.md)

* **Steal session cookies via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * The absence of the `secure` flag allows session cookies to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, making them vulnerable to interception. The lack of the `HttpOnly` flag makes them accessible to client-side JavaScript, increasing the risk of theft via XSS attacks. Successful cookie theft allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Rendering Vulnerabilities (if using direct Sinatra templating) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_rendering_vulnerabilities__if_using_direct_sinatra_templating___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Template Rendering Vulnerabilities (if using direct Sinatra templating) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

* **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code into template variables that gets executed during rendering. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_template_variables_that_gets_executed_during_rendering___critical_node_.md)

* **Inject malicious code into template variables that gets executed during rendering. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * If user-provided input is directly embedded into template code without proper sanitization, attackers can inject template directives or code that will be executed by the templating engine on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities (Common Sinatra Pattern) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__common_sinatra_pattern___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities (Common Sinatra Pattern) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Rack Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_rack_middleware__critical_node_.md)

* **Vulnerable Rack Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in commonly used Rack middleware that Sinatra applications rely on. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_commonly_used_rack_middleware_that_sinatra_applications_rely_on___critica_d20e189e.md)

* **Exploit vulnerabilities in commonly used Rack middleware that Sinatra applications rely on. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Sinatra applications often use Rack middleware for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these middleware components can be exploited to compromise the application. This could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific middleware vulnerability.
