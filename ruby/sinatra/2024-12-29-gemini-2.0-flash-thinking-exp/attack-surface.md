Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Sinatra, with high and critical severity:

*   **Route Hijacking/Ambiguity**
    *   **Description:**  A more general route matches a request intended for a more specific route, leading to unintended code execution.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra's route matching is based on the order of definition. If routes are not ordered carefully, a broader pattern can intercept requests meant for a more specific one defined later.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `/users/:id` (defined later)
        *   `/users/new` (defined earlier)
        A request to `/users/new` might be incorrectly matched by `/users/:id` with `:id` being "new".
    *   **Impact:** Access to unintended functionality, potential data manipulation, bypassing authorization checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define more specific routes before more general ones.
        *   Use explicit route definitions instead of relying heavily on wildcards.
        *   Thoroughly test route matching logic.

*   **Unsanitized Request Parameters leading to Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** User-provided data from request parameters is used directly in operations (e.g., database queries, system commands) without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra automatically parses request parameters (query string, form data) and makes them easily accessible. If developers don't sanitize this data before use, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `get '/search' do; "Results for: #{params['query']}"; end`
        An attacker could send a request like `/search?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` leading to Cross-Site Scripting.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, other injection-based attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
        *   Employ output encoding to prevent XSS.
        *   Avoid directly executing system commands with user-provided data.

*   **Insecure File Upload Handling**
    *   **Description:**  The application allows users to upload files without proper validation, leading to potential security risks.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra provides access to uploaded files through the `params` hash. If the application doesn't validate file types, sizes, and contents, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `post '/upload' do; tempfile = params['file'][:tempfile]; File.open("uploads/#{params['file'][:filename]}", 'wb') { |f| f.write tempfile.read }; end`
        An attacker could upload a malicious executable or a web shell.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, denial of service, storage exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types based on content, not just the extension.
        *   Limit file sizes.
        *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a dedicated, isolated storage.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Engines**
    *   **Description:**  Unescaped user-provided data is rendered in HTML templates, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra commonly uses template engines like ERB or Haml. If developers directly embed user input into templates without proper escaping, XSS vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `erb "<h1>Welcome <%= params['name'] %></h1>"`
        A request like `/?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` would execute the script in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data when rendering it in templates. Most template engines provide automatic escaping mechanisms.
        *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **Insecure Session Management**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are handled, potentially allowing attackers to hijack or manipulate sessions.
    *   **How Sinatra Contributes:** Sinatra provides basic session management. If the default session secret is used or a weak secret is configured, or if secure flags are not set on cookies, it introduces risks.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Using the default session secret makes it easier for attackers to forge session cookies.
        *   Not setting the `secure` flag on the session cookie allows it to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set a strong, randomly generated session secret.
        *   Enable the `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on session cookies.
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation.
        *   Consider using a more robust session management solution if needed.
