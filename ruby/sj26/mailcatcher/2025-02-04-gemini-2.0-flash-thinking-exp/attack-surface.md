# Attack Surface Analysis for sj26/mailcatcher

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Web Interface Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_web_interface_access.md)

**Description:** The Mailcatcher web interface, which displays captured emails, is accessible without any authentication by default.
*   **Mailcatcher Contribution:** Mailcatcher is designed to provide a web interface for viewing captured emails, but it lacks built-in authentication mechanisms. This default open access is a core design characteristic of Mailcatcher.
*   **Example:** A developer deploys Mailcatcher on a server within the company network. Any employee who discovers the server's IP address and port can access the web interface and view all captured emails, potentially including sensitive credentials or confidential project information sent in test emails.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of highly sensitive data contained within captured emails. This can lead to significant breaches of confidentiality, especially if emails contain credentials, personal data, or proprietary information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Restriction:** Deploy Mailcatcher on a private network segment, restricting access to the web interface (port 1080 by default) to only authorized development machines or users via firewall rules.
    *   **Reverse Proxy Authentication:**  Place Mailcatcher behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) and implement authentication at the reverse proxy level. This adds a necessary security layer before accessing the Mailcatcher application itself.
    *   **VPN Access:** Require users to connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to access the network where Mailcatcher is deployed, adding a strong layer of access control.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Public Exposure](./attack_surfaces/accidental_public_exposure.md)

**Description:** A Mailcatcher instance, intended for internal development and testing, is mistakenly made accessible to the public internet.
*   **Mailcatcher Contribution:** Mailcatcher's default configuration does not inherently prevent public exposure. The risk arises from misconfigurations during deployment, especially in cloud environments, where network settings might be inadvertently set to public.
*   **Example:** A developer sets up Mailcatcher on a cloud server but misconfigures the security group or firewall rules, allowing inbound traffic on ports 1080 and 1025 from `0.0.0.0/0`. This makes the Mailcatcher web interface and SMTP server publicly accessible to anyone on the internet.
*   **Impact:**  Critical information disclosure. All emails captured by the publicly exposed Mailcatcher instance become accessible to anyone on the internet. This represents a severe data breach, potentially exposing a large volume of sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Security Audits:** Regularly audit network configurations, firewall rules, and cloud security group settings to ensure Mailcatcher instances are not unintentionally exposed to the public internet.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege Network Access:** Configure network access based on the principle of least privilege. Only allow necessary traffic to Mailcatcher from trusted internal networks and explicitly deny access from the public internet.
    *   **Internal Deployment and Verification:** Deploy Mailcatcher exclusively within internal, private networks that are not directly routable from the public internet. After deployment, rigorously verify network accessibility to confirm it is not publicly reachable.
