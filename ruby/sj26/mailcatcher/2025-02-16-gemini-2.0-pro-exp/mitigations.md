# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sj26/mailcatcher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Isolation and Access Control (MailCatcher Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/network_isolation_and_access_control__mailcatcher_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict MailCatcher's Network Binding

**Description:**
1.  **Identify MailCatcher's Startup Options:** Examine how MailCatcher is started (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration file, Docker Compose).
2.  **`--http-ip` and `--smtp-ip`:** Use the `--http-ip` and `--smtp-ip` command-line options (or their equivalents in a configuration file) to explicitly bind MailCatcher to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1).
    *   Example (Command-line): `mailcatcher --http-ip=127.0.0.1 --smtp-ip=127.0.0.1`
    *   Example (Docker Compose, within the `command` section):
        ```yaml
        services:
          mailcatcher:
            image: sj26/mailcatcher
            command: --http-ip=127.0.0.1 --smtp-ip=127.0.0.1
            # ... other configurations ...
        ```
3.  **Verification:** After starting MailCatcher, use a network utility (e.g., `netstat`, `ss`) to confirm that it's only listening on 127.0.0.1.
    *   Example (Linux): `netstat -tulnp | grep mailcatcher` (should only show 127.0.0.1)
4. **Firewall (Host-Level):** Even with correct binding, add host-level firewall rules (iptables, ufw, Windows Firewall) to *block* all inbound connections to ports 1025 and 1080 *except* from 127.0.0.1. This provides a defense-in-depth layer.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data (Severity: High):** Prevents access to intercepted emails from other machines on the network.
*   **Unintended Email Delivery (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of misconfiguration leading to external access.
*   **Access Control Issues (Severity: High):** Limits access to the MailCatcher interface.
*   **Message Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Makes it harder for an attacker to access and modify emails.

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Unintended Email Delivery:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Access Control Issues:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Message Manipulation:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Yes/No/Partially:** (Specify one)
*   **Location:** (e.g., MailCatcher startup script, Docker Compose file, firewall configuration)

**Missing Implementation:**
*   (e.g., "MailCatcher is currently binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0).", "No firewall rules are in place to restrict access to MailCatcher's ports.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Purge Emails (MailCatcher API)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_purge_emails__mailcatcher_api_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Automated Email Purging via MailCatcher's API

**Description:**
1.  **Script Creation:** Write a script (e.g., Bash, Python) that uses the `curl` command (or a similar HTTP client) to send a DELETE request to MailCatcher's `/messages` API endpoint.
    *   Example (Bash):
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        MAILCATCHER_HOST="localhost"  # Or the hostname if using Docker
        MAILCATCHER_PORT="1080"
        curl -X DELETE http://$MAILCATCHER_HOST:$MAILCATCHER_PORT/messages
        ```
2.  **Scheduling:** Use a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Linux, Task Scheduler on Windows) to run this script at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
    *   Example (cron - daily at 3:00 AM):
        ```
        0 3 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
        ```
3.  **Error Handling:** Add basic error handling to the script to check the HTTP response code and log any failures.
4. **Verification:** After the script runs, check the MailCatcher web interface to confirm that the messages have been deleted.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low):** Prevents MailCatcher from being overwhelmed.

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Risk reduced.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk minimized.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Yes/No/Partially:** (Specify one)
*   **Location:** (e.g., script file, cron job configuration)

**Missing Implementation:**
*   (e.g., "No automated purging is in place.", "Purging is done manually and infrequently.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reverse Proxy with Authentication (If Necessary)](./mitigation_strategies/reverse_proxy_with_authentication__if_necessary_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a reverse proxy (Nginx or Apache) with basic authentication *in front* of MailCatcher. This is *only* recommended if network isolation is absolutely impossible, and you *must* expose MailCatcher beyond localhost. Network isolation is *always* preferred.

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Reverse Proxy:** Select either Nginx or Apache. Nginx is generally preferred for its performance and ease of configuration for this purpose.
2.  **Install and Configure:** Install the chosen reverse proxy on the same machine as MailCatcher (or a machine that can access MailCatcher).
3.  **Configuration (Nginx Example):**
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 8080;  # Choose a port *different* from MailCatcher's default
        server_name mailcatcher.example.com; # Or an IP address

        location / {
            auth_basic "Restricted";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd; # Path to htpasswd file
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1080; # Forward to MailCatcher
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
    ```
4.  **Create .htpasswd File:** Use the `htpasswd` utility to create a username and password for accessing MailCatcher.
    ```bash
    htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd yourusername
    ```
5.  **Restart Nginx:** Restart the Nginx service to apply the configuration.
6.  **Access:** Access MailCatcher through the reverse proxy's port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). You will be prompted for the username and password.
7. **Firewall:** Configure your firewall to *only* allow access to the reverse proxy's port (8080 in this example), and *block* direct access to MailCatcher's port (1080).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data (Severity: High):** Adds a layer of authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Access Control Issues (Severity: High):** Requires credentials to access the MailCatcher interface.
*   **Message Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Makes it harder for an attacker to access and modify emails.

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Risk reduced, but network isolation is still strongly preferred.
*   **Access Control Issues:** Risk reduced.
*   **Message Manipulation:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Yes/No/Partially:** (Specify one)
*   **Location:** (e.g., Nginx configuration file, .htpasswd file)

**Missing Implementation:**
*   (e.g., "MailCatcher is directly accessible without authentication.", "No reverse proxy is configured.")
