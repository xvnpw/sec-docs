 >>High-Risk Path>> (1.2.1 Default/Weak)
                    [CRITICAL] Credentials

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Intercept/View Emails (Information Disclosure)](./attack_tree_paths/1__interceptview_emails__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for attacks aiming to gain unauthorized access to email content.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Network Sniffing (Unencrypted HTTP) - [CRITICAL] if unprotected network](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_network_sniffing__unencrypted_http__-__critical__if_unprotected_network.md)

*   **Description:** MailCatcher uses HTTP by default, not HTTPS.  If the application and MailCatcher are not on the same machine or within a secure, isolated network, an attacker on the same network can intercept the traffic. This exposes all email content.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if used over an untrusted network without protection) / Very Low (if used in a secure, isolated environment)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (depending on email content sensitivity)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires network monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use MailCatcher within a secure, isolated environment (e.g., Docker, local machine, VPN).
    *   Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with HTTPS.
    *   Consider SSH tunneling.
    *   *Never* use MailCatcher over an untrusted network without additional security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Access MailCatcher UI - [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_access_mailcatcher_ui_-__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The MailCatcher web UI provides access to all captured emails.  If an attacker gains access, they can view all content.
*   **Likelihood:** Very High (due to the lack of authentication)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (full access to all captured emails)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if no network restrictions or authentication are in place)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (if access logs are monitored, but MailCatcher doesn't log by default) / Hard (if no logging)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* expose the MailCatcher UI directly to the internet or an untrusted network.
    *   Implement network-level access control (firewall rules, security groups).
    *   Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with basic authentication (or better).
    *   Consider modifying MailCatcher's source code to add authentication (advanced).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Default/Weak Credentials - [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_defaultweak_credentials_-__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** MailCatcher has *no* built-in authentication.  Anyone who can access the web UI can see all emails.
*   **Likelihood:** Very High (inherent to the design)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (complete email exposure)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (if access logs are monitored, but MailCatcher doesn't log by default) / Hard (if no logging)
*   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.2 (Access MailCatcher UI) - this is the core issue addressed by those mitigations. The lack of credentials *is* the vulnerability.
