# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sj26/mailcatcher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Access to Mailcatcher UI](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_access_to_mailcatcher_ui.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Access to Mailcatcher Web UI Port
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Mailcatcher UI port:** By default, Mailcatcher UI runs on port 1080.
    2.  **Configure firewall rules (on development machine or network firewall):** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to port 1080.
        *   **Allow access from developer workstations:**  Permit inbound traffic to port 1080 only from the IP addresses or IP ranges of authorized developer workstations within the development network.
        *   **Deny access from all other sources:**  Explicitly deny inbound traffic to port 1080 from all other IP addresses, including the public internet and potentially other internal networks (depending on network segmentation).
    3.  **Verify firewall rules:** Test the firewall rules to ensure that the Mailcatcher UI is only accessible from authorized developer machines and inaccessible from unauthorized locations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Captured Emails via Web UI (Severity: High) - If the UI is publicly accessible or easily reachable within the internal network, unauthorized individuals could view sensitive information in captured emails.
    *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Web UI (Severity: High) -  Exposure of captured emails through an open UI can lead to sensitive data leaks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Captured Emails via Web UI: High Reduction
    *   Information Disclosure via Web UI: High Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Firewall on developer machines is enabled, but specific rules for Mailcatcher UI port are not configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to configure specific firewall rules on developer machines or the network firewall to restrict access to Mailcatcher UI port (1080) as described.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Basic Authentication for Mailcatcher UI (via Proxy)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_basic_authentication_for_mailcatcher_ui__via_proxy_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Add Basic Authentication to Mailcatcher UI using a Reverse Proxy
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install and configure a reverse proxy:** Choose a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Apache and install it on a machine accessible within the development network, ideally in front of the Mailcatcher instance.
    2.  **Configure the reverse proxy to proxy requests to Mailcatcher:** Set up the reverse proxy to forward requests to Mailcatcher's web UI (typically running on `localhost:1080`).
    3.  **Enable Basic Authentication in the reverse proxy configuration:** Configure the reverse proxy to require basic authentication for access to the proxied Mailcatcher UI path.
    4.  **Create user accounts for authorized developers:** Create user accounts with strong passwords within the reverse proxy's authentication mechanism for developers who need to access the Mailcatcher UI.
    5.  **Test authentication:** Verify that accessing the Mailcatcher UI through the reverse proxy now requires authentication and that only authorized users can successfully log in.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Captured Emails via Web UI (Severity: Medium) - Even if network access is restricted, an additional authentication layer prevents casual or accidental unauthorized viewing within the allowed network.
    *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Web UI (Severity: Medium) - Adds a layer of defense against information disclosure by requiring authentication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Captured Emails via Web UI: Medium Reduction
    *   Information Disclosure via Web UI: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Mailcatcher UI is currently accessible without authentication within the development network.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to install and configure a reverse proxy (like Nginx), configure basic authentication on it, and proxy requests to Mailcatcher UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Clear Mailcatcher Email Storage](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_clear_mailcatcher_email_storage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Regular Email Storage Clearing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Mailcatcher storage location:** Determine where Mailcatcher stores captured emails (in-memory or on disk). If on disk, locate the storage directory.
    2.  **Develop a clearing script or process:** Create a script or manual process to delete captured emails from Mailcatcher's storage. This could involve:
        *   Using Mailcatcher's command-line interface (if available) to clear emails.
        *   Directly deleting files from the storage directory (if disk-based storage).
        *   Using Mailcatcher's API (if available) to programmatically clear emails.
    3.  **Schedule regular clearing:** Automate the clearing process to run regularly, such as daily or after each testing cycle, using cron jobs or task schedulers.
    4.  **Verify clearing process:** Regularly check that the clearing process is running successfully and that email storage is being cleared as scheduled.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Data Accumulation and Increased Risk Window (Severity: Medium) -  If emails are not cleared, the volume of captured data grows over time, increasing the potential impact of a security breach if Mailcatcher is compromised.
    *   **Threat:** Stale and Irrelevant Data (Severity: Low) -  Accumulated emails can become stale and irrelevant, cluttering the system and potentially making it harder to manage and review relevant test emails.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Accumulation and Increased Risk Window: Medium Reduction
    *   Stale and Irrelevant Data: Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Email storage in Mailcatcher is not cleared regularly.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to develop a script or process to clear Mailcatcher email storage and schedule it to run regularly (e.g., daily).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider In-Memory Storage for Mailcatcher](./mitigation_strategies/consider_in-memory_storage_for_mailcatcher.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize In-Memory Storage for Mailcatcher (if suitable)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Mailcatcher for in-memory storage:**  By default, Mailcatcher uses in-memory storage. Verify that your Mailcatcher deployment is configured to use in-memory storage and not disk-based storage.  This might involve checking command-line arguments or configuration files used to start Mailcatcher.
    2.  **Understand data persistence:** Recognize that in-memory storage means captured emails are *not* persisted across Mailcatcher restarts. Emails will be lost when the Mailcatcher process is stopped or restarted.
    3.  **Restart Mailcatcher regularly (as part of environment cleanup):** If in-memory storage is used, consider incorporating regular restarts of the Mailcatcher process into your development environment cleanup procedures. This will automatically clear captured emails.
    4.  **Monitor memory usage:** Be mindful of memory consumption if you expect to capture a large volume of emails. In-memory storage can lead to increased memory usage. Monitor Mailcatcher's memory usage to ensure it doesn't impact system performance.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Data Persistence and Long-Term Storage of Test Emails (Severity: Low to Medium) - In-memory storage prevents long-term persistence of test emails, reducing the window of opportunity for unauthorized access to historical email data.
    *   **Threat:** Risk of Disk-Based Storage Security Issues (Severity: Low) - Avoids potential security issues related to securing disk-based storage of captured emails (file permissions, access control to storage location, etc.).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Persistence and Long-Term Storage of Test Emails: Medium Reduction (if restarts are frequent) to Low Reduction (if restarts are infrequent)
    *   Risk of Disk-Based Storage Security Issues: Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented by default as Mailcatcher uses in-memory storage unless configured otherwise.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider formalizing a process to regularly restart Mailcatcher as part of development environment cleanup to leverage the ephemeral nature of in-memory storage for automatic email clearing.
