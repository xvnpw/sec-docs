## Attack Tree Path: [1. Access Sensitive Information via MailCatcher [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__access_sensitive_information_via_mailcatcher__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information captured by MailCatcher. This information is primarily stored in the emails received and displayed through the web UI.

    *   **1.1. Unauthenticated Access to Web UI [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of authentication on MailCatcher's web interface to directly access and view all captured emails.
        *   **Critical Node: 1.1.1. MailCatcher Web UI Exposed [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:**  If MailCatcher is configured to listen on an interface accessible from outside the local machine (e.g., 0.0.0.0 or a public IP) and is not protected by network firewalls or access controls, the web UI becomes publicly accessible.
            *   **Insight [CRITICAL NODE]:** MailCatcher's design for development environments often leads to default configurations with no authentication, prioritizing ease of use over security.
            *   **Action [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The primary mitigation is to ensure MailCatcher is **never** exposed to public networks or untrusted environments. It should be bound to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) or a private development network. Network segmentation and firewall rules are crucial to restrict access to trusted developers only.

    *   **1.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web UI [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into email content and exploiting MailCatcher's web UI to execute this script in a developer's browser when they view the email.
        *   **Critical Node: 1.2.1. Inject Malicious Script via Email Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** An attacker crafts an email containing malicious HTML and JavaScript. This email is sent to the application and captured by MailCatcher.
            *   **Insight [CRITICAL NODE]:** MailCatcher's web UI is designed to display email content, including HTML and JavaScript, for debugging purposes. It likely lacks robust input sanitization to prevent XSS.
            *   **Action [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Since MailCatcher likely lacks built-in XSS protection, developers must be extremely cautious when viewing emails, especially from untrusted sources or automated systems. Even in development, treat email content as potentially malicious.  Consider contributing to the MailCatcher project to implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and input sanitization for the web UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Disrupt Application Functionality via MailCatcher [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__disrupt_application_functionality_via_mailcatcher__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to disrupt the development workflow by causing a Denial of Service (DoS) against MailCatcher, making it unavailable or impacting its performance.

    *   **2.1. Denial of Service (DoS) via SMTP Flooding [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Overwhelming MailCatcher's SMTP server with a large volume of emails, causing resource exhaustion (primarily memory) and potentially crashing MailCatcher or the host system.
        *   **Critical Node: 2.1.1. Send Large Volume of Emails [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** An attacker sends a flood of emails to the SMTP port that MailCatcher is listening on.
            *   **Insight [CRITICAL NODE]:** MailCatcher stores all received emails in memory.  A large influx of emails can quickly consume available memory, leading to performance degradation or a crash.
            *   **Action [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Implement rate limiting or connection limits on the SMTP server if possible. While MailCatcher itself might not offer these features directly, the underlying system or network infrastructure could potentially provide such controls.  Monitor MailCatcher's resource usage (memory, CPU) to detect potential DoS attacks.  Limiting the size of emails sent to MailCatcher during development can also help mitigate this risk.
