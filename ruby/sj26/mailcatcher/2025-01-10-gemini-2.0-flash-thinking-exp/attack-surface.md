# Attack Surface Analysis for sj26/mailcatcher

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Intercepted Emails](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_intercepted_emails.md)

* **Description:** The Mailcatcher web interface, by default, lacks any authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    * **How Mailcatcher Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mailcatcher's core functionality is to intercept and display emails. Without authentication, anyone with network access to the Mailcatcher instance can view all captured emails.
    * **Example:** A developer accidentally exposes the Mailcatcher port (1080 by default) to the public internet. An attacker discovers this open port and can browse the Mailcatcher interface, reading emails containing sensitive user data, API keys, or password reset links.
    * **Impact:** Full disclosure of sensitive information contained within intercepted emails. Potential for account takeover (via password reset links), data breaches, and exposure of internal application secrets.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict Network Access: Ensure Mailcatcher is only accessible from the developer's local machine or a private development network using firewall rules or network segmentation.
        * Avoid Public Exposure: Never expose the Mailcatcher port directly to the public internet.
        * Use VPN or SSH Tunneling: When remote access is necessary, use a VPN or SSH tunnel to securely access the development environment.
        * Consider Alternatives for Production:** Mailcatcher is not intended for production use. Use dedicated email testing or staging environments that mimic production security measures.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Email Content](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_email_content.md)

* **Description:** Intercepted emails can contain sensitive information about the application's functionality, data structures, and error handling.
    * **How Mailcatcher Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mailcatcher stores the full content of intercepted emails, making this information readily available to anyone who can access the interface.
    * **Example:** An error in the application's email sending logic includes a database connection string in the email body. An attacker accessing Mailcatcher can retrieve this connection string and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of internal application details, potential for privilege escalation, and further exploitation based on the disclosed information.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review Email Content: Developers should be aware of the information being sent in emails, even in development environments. Avoid including sensitive data directly in email bodies or headers unless absolutely necessary.
        * Implement Proper Error Handling: Ensure error messages in emails do not reveal sensitive internal details.
        * Regularly Clear Mailcatcher: Implement a process to regularly clear the intercepted emails in Mailcatcher to minimize the window of opportunity for information disclosure.
