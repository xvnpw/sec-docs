## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Attacker Directly Accesses Web Interface](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_attacker_directly_accesses_web_interface.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Unauthenticated access to the Mailcatcher web interface.
*   **Steps:**
    1. Mailcatcher is deployed without any form of authentication.
    2. The attacker discovers the URL or IP address where Mailcatcher is hosted.
    3. The attacker navigates to the Mailcatcher web interface using a web browser.
    4. The attacker gains immediate access to all emails captured by Mailcatcher, potentially containing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Attacker Directly Accesses API Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_attacker_directly_accesses_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated access to the Mailcatcher API.
*   **Steps:**
    1. Mailcatcher's API is enabled and accessible without any authentication mechanism.
    2. The attacker identifies the API endpoints (e.g., through documentation or reconnaissance).
    3. The attacker uses tools like `curl`, `wget`, or custom scripts to send requests to the API endpoints.
    4. The attacker can programmatically retrieve and potentially manipulate email data stored within Mailcatcher.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Attacker Sends Malicious Email Captured by Mailcatcher](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_attacker_sends_malicious_email_captured_by_mailcatcher.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the application's lack of email content validation.
*   **Steps:**
    1. The attacker crafts a malicious email. This email might contain:
        *   Scripts intended for execution if the application renders HTML emails.
        *   Specific data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's email processing logic.
        *   Links to malicious websites.
    2. The application, during its normal operation or testing, sends an email that is intercepted and stored by Mailcatcher.
    3. The application later retrieves and processes the emails from Mailcatcher.
    4. Due to the lack of proper validation or sanitization, the application processes the malicious content, leading to unintended consequences such as:
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the email content is displayed in a web interface without proper encoding.
        *   Data injection vulnerabilities if the email content is used in database queries or other commands without sanitization.
        *   Triggering unintended application behavior based on the malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Mailcatcher Deployed Without Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_mailcatcher_deployed_without_authentication.md)

*   **Significance:** This is a critical failure in the security posture of the Mailcatcher deployment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Direct and immediate access to all captured emails via the web interface.
    *   Enables the "Attacker Directly Accesses Web Interface" High-Risk Path.
    *   Increases the likelihood of information leakage and potential misuse of sensitive data.
    *   Makes Mailcatcher a trivial target for attackers with basic web browsing skills.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Mailcatcher API Deployed Without Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_mailcatcher_api_deployed_without_authentication.md)

*   **Significance:** This exposes the programmatic interface of Mailcatcher without any access control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Allows attackers to programmatically retrieve and potentially manipulate all captured emails.
    *   Enables the "Attacker Directly Accesses API Endpoints" High-Risk Path.
    *   Facilitates automated data extraction and potential integration with other attack tools.
    *   Can lead to a larger scale compromise compared to manual access via the web interface.
