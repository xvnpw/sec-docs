# Threat Model Analysis for sj26/mailcatcher

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Intercepted Emails](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_intercepted_emails.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the Mailcatcher web interface or API because Mailcatcher, by default, lacks authentication. They can then view all intercepted emails, potentially containing sensitive information. This can be done by simply navigating to the Mailcatcher URL or making API requests.

**Impact:** Exposure of potentially sensitive information contained in the emails, such as user credentials, API keys, personal data, application secrets, or confidential business communications intended for testing purposes. This could lead to further attacks or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Web Interface, API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict network access to the Mailcatcher instance, making it accessible only from trusted development or testing environments.
*   Utilize network segmentation or firewalls to control access.
*   If Mailcatcher allows for authentication configuration (through plugins or reverse proxy), enable and enforce strong authentication mechanisms.
*   Regularly review network configurations to ensure Mailcatcher is not inadvertently exposed.

## Threat: [Disclosure through Mailcatcher's API](./threats/disclosure_through_mailcatcher's_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the Mailcatcher API to programmatically retrieve intercepted emails. This can occur because the API inherits the lack of authentication from the core Mailcatcher application. Attackers could automate the process of extracting email content.

**Impact:** Large-scale extraction of potentially sensitive data from intercepted emails, enabling attackers to gather significant amounts of information efficiently.

**Affected Component:** API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply the same network access restrictions as for the web interface.
*   If Mailcatcher or a reverse proxy allows, implement API key authentication or other authorization mechanisms for API access.
*   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.
*   Ensure the API is not publicly accessible without proper authorization.

## Threat: [Abuse of Functionality in Non-Development Environments](./threats/abuse_of_functionality_in_non-development_environments.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration or oversight, a Mailcatcher instance is accidentally deployed or left running in a production or staging environment. Mailcatcher's core functionality of intercepting emails then leads to the capture of real user emails.

**Impact:** Significant privacy and security breaches due to the interception of legitimate user communications. This can have severe legal and reputational consequences.

**Affected Component:** Deployment Configuration (of Mailcatcher itself)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict environment separation and configuration management practices.
*   Clearly document the intended use of Mailcatcher and enforce its use only in development and testing environments.
*   Automate deployment processes to prevent manual errors.
*   Regularly audit deployed applications and infrastructure to identify and remove any unintended Mailcatcher instances.
