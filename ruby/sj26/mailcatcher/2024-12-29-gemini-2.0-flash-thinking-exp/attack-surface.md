*   **Unauthenticated Web Interface Access**
    *   **Description:** The web interface for viewing captured emails is accessible without any authentication by default.
    *   **How MailCatcher Contributes:** MailCatcher's default configuration does not enable any form of authentication for the web interface.
    *   **Example:** A developer leaves their workstation unlocked, and a colleague (malicious or otherwise) accesses the MailCatcher web interface and views sensitive information contained in captured emails (e.g., password reset links, API keys).
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of potentially sensitive data contained within captured emails.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Network Access: Use firewall rules to limit access to the MailCatcher web interface port (default 1080) to only trusted development machines.
        *   Use a Reverse Proxy with Authentication: Place MailCatcher behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) and configure authentication on the proxy level.
        *   Access Control Lists (ACLs): If the environment allows, configure ACLs on the network or host level to restrict access to the web interface.
