## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization.md)

This path represents the fundamental ability of an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the RailsAdmin interface. Success here opens the door to a wide range of subsequent attacks.

* **Exploit Default Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application uses the default username and password for RailsAdmin that were not changed after installation.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium -  A common oversight during deployment.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Grants immediate administrative access to RailsAdmin.
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires simply trying known default credentials.
    * **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal technical knowledge.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Easily detectable through failed login attempts with default credentials if logging is in place.
* **Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a known or zero-day vulnerability within the RailsAdmin gem itself that allows bypassing the authentication mechanism without valid credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the presence of such vulnerabilities and their public disclosure.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Complete bypass of the authentication system, granting unauthorized access.
    * **Effort:** Medium-High - Requires identifying and exploiting the specific vulnerability.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium-High - Requires expertise in web application security and vulnerability exploitation.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium - May leave traces in logs or through unusual access patterns, but can be sophisticated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation.md)

Once an attacker gains access (through bypassing authentication), the ability to directly manipulate data within the application's database through RailsAdmin poses a significant threat.

* **Modify Sensitive Data (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker directly modifies sensitive records (e.g., user credentials, financial information, personal data) through the RailsAdmin interface.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium-High - Straightforward to perform once authenticated.
    * **Impact:** High - Compromise of sensitive information, leading to potential financial loss, identity theft, or reputational damage.
    * **Effort:** Low - Easy to perform using the RailsAdmin interface.
    * **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic understanding of the RailsAdmin interface.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium - Depends on the level of logging and auditing of data modifications.
* **Inject Malicious Data (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker injects malicious scripts (for Cross-Site Scripting - XSS), SQL injection payloads, or other harmful data into database fields via the RailsAdmin interface. This malicious data can then be executed or interpreted by the main application, compromising its security or functionality.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the main application.
    * **Impact:** High - Can lead to XSS vulnerabilities affecting users, SQL injection vulnerabilities allowing further data breaches, or other application-level compromises.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting effective malicious payloads.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of web application vulnerabilities and payload construction.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring for unusual data patterns and potential exploitation attempts in the main application.
* **Mass Data Deletion/Modification (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker utilizes RailsAdmin's bulk action features to delete or modify a large number of records, potentially causing significant data loss or corruption.
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Relies on unauthorized access and the availability of bulk action features.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to irreversible data loss, business disruption, and significant financial impact.
    * **Effort:** Low - Easy to perform if bulk actions are available in RailsAdmin.
    * **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic understanding of the RailsAdmin interface.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Typically leaves clear audit trails in logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_code_execution.md)

This path involves manipulating data or configurations through RailsAdmin in a way that ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

* **Manipulate Data Used in Code Execution (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker modifies database records that are subsequently used in code execution paths within the application. This could include modifying template content stored in the database, altering data used in background jobs, or manipulating dynamic configuration settings that are read and interpreted as code.
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Requires specific knowledge of how data is used within the application's codebase.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server and application.
    * **Effort:** Medium-High - Requires significant understanding of the application's architecture and code execution flow.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium-High - Requires development and potentially reverse engineering skills.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High - Can be very difficult to detect without specific monitoring of data changes and their impact on code execution.
* **Exploit File Upload Functionality (if enabled) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application exposes file upload fields for models through RailsAdmin, an authenticated attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executables) that can then be executed on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on whether file upload fields are exposed and if proper security measures are in place.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting malicious files suitable for server-side execution.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of web shells, server-side scripting, and exploitation techniques.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring file uploads, server activity, and potentially using malware scanning tools.
