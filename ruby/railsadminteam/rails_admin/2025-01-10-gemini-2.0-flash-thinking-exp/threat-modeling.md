# Threat Model Analysis for railsadminteam/rails_admin

## Threat: [Default or Weak Authentication Configuration](./threats/default_or_weak_authentication_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might attempt to log in using default credentials (if not changed) or try common usernames and passwords, potentially gaining full administrative access to the RailsAdmin interface. This allows them to bypass normal access controls.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including the ability to view, modify, and delete any data managed through RailsAdmin. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Immediately change the default username and password for the RailsAdmin interface.
* Implement a strong password policy and enforce its use.
* Consider integrating RailsAdmin authentication with the application's existing authentication system.

## Threat: [Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./threats/lack_of_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has obtained valid credentials (through phishing, credential stuffing, etc.) can log in to RailsAdmin without needing a second factor of authentication, bypassing basic password protection.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the RailsAdmin interface, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication for all RailsAdmin users.
* Utilize a reliable MFA provider or solution.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Granularity](./threats/insufficient_authorization_granularity.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited administrative privileges within RailsAdmin might be able to access or modify data or perform actions beyond their intended scope due to overly permissive authorization rules *within RailsAdmin*.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation within RailsAdmin, allowing attackers to perform actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data breaches or corruption.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully define and implement granular authorization rules *within RailsAdmin* based on the principle of least privilege.
* Restrict access to sensitive models and actions to only necessary administrators.
* Regularly review and audit authorization configurations *within RailsAdmin*.

## Threat: [Bypass of Application-Level Authorization](./threats/bypass_of_application-level_authorization.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities *in RailsAdmin* that allow them to bypass the application's standard authorization logic, granting them administrative access regardless of normal user permissions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities *through RailsAdmin*, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, potentially integration points with application models

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure RailsAdmin's authorization is tightly integrated with and respects the application's authorization framework.
* Thoroughly test the integration to prevent bypasses.
* Avoid relying solely on RailsAdmin's authorization and ensure application-level checks are in place.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft malicious requests *through RailsAdmin's edit or create forms* to modify unintended attributes of a model, potentially altering sensitive data or application state.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application settings, and potential security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Model Editing/Creation Functionality, Form Handling

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Rails' `strong_parameters` feature to explicitly define which attributes are permitted for mass assignment within the application models.
* Ensure that RailsAdmin respects these `strong_parameters` configurations.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Deletion or Modification](./threats/unintended_data_deletion_or_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker with administrative access to RailsAdmin, either legitimate or gained through compromise, could intentionally or accidentally delete or modify critical data through RailsAdmin's data management interfaces.

**Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, and potential disruption of application functionality.

**Affected Component:** Model Editing/Deletion Functionality

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust access controls and audit logging within RailsAdmin to track data modifications.
* Consider implementing soft deletes instead of permanent deletion.
* Regularly back up data to facilitate recovery from accidental or malicious changes.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Model Callbacks or Overrides](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__through_model_callbacks_or_overrides.md)

**Description:** An attacker with administrative privileges within RailsAdmin might be able to modify model definitions or override methods *through RailsAdmin*, injecting malicious code that is then executed by the application.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** Model Configuration/Editing

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Severely restrict access to model configuration and editing within RailsAdmin.
* Carefully audit any modifications made through RailsAdmin.
* Avoid allowing direct code modification through the interface.

## Threat: [File System Access (Potential)](./threats/file_system_access__potential_.md)

**Description:** Depending on custom actions or configurations *within RailsAdmin*, it could potentially be used to access or manipulate files on the server's file system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and the ability to modify or delete critical system files.

**Affected Component:** Custom Actions

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid implementing custom actions in RailsAdmin that directly interact with the file system.
* If file system access is necessary, implement strict authorization and validation checks.

## Threat: [Exposure of RailsAdmin Interface in Production](./threats/exposure_of_railsadmin_interface_in_production.md)

**Description:** Leaving the RailsAdmin interface accessible in a production environment significantly increases the attack surface, allowing attackers to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities *within RailsAdmin*.

**Impact:** Increased risk of unauthorized access and exploitation of RailsAdmin vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Routing, Deployment Configuration

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to the RailsAdmin interface in production environments, typically by IP address or through a VPN.
* Consider using a separate, more secure administrative interface for production.
