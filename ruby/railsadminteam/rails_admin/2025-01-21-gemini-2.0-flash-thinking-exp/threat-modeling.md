# Threat Model Analysis for railsadminteam/rails_admin

## Threat: [Default Credentials or Weak Authentication](./threats/default_credentials_or_weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the RailsAdmin interface using default credentials (if not changed) or easily guessable passwords. They would then gain full administrative access *through RailsAdmin*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its data, including the ability to read, modify, and delete any information *accessible via RailsAdmin*. Potential for further attacks on the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Middleware *within RailsAdmin*, User Model Integration *with RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all administrative users *accessing RailsAdmin*.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts *using RailsAdmin*.
    *   Disable or change any default credentials provided by *RailsAdmin* or integrated authentication systems.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions *within the context of RailsAdmin access*.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in *RailsAdmin's* authorization logic to access or modify resources they are not intended to *through the RailsAdmin interface*. This might involve manipulating parameters or exploiting flaws in permission checks *within RailsAdmin*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical application settings, and potential privilege escalation *within the administrative context provided by RailsAdmin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Authorization Logic *(specific to RailsAdmin, e.g., CanCanCan integration within RailsAdmin)*, Controller Actions *within RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test *RailsAdmin's* authorization configuration.
    *   Ensure that authorization checks are correctly implemented and enforced for all actions *within RailsAdmin*.
    *   Keep *RailsAdmin* and its authorization dependencies (e.g., CanCanCan) updated to the latest versions.
    *   Implement robust integration tests covering authorization rules *specifically for RailsAdmin*.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate request parameters *sent to RailsAdmin* to modify model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible *through the RailsAdmin interface*. This allows them to change sensitive data or bypass business logic *via RailsAdmin's data modification features*.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of sensitive information, and potential circumvention of application rules *through RailsAdmin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Model Configuration *within RailsAdmin*, Form Handling *in RailsAdmin*, Controller Actions *in RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully define the `edit` and `create` fields for each model in the *RailsAdmin* configuration, explicitly allowing only necessary attributes.
    *   Utilize strong parameter filtering in the underlying Rails models to prevent unintended attribute updates *even if RailsAdmin allows them*.
    *   Regularly review the *RailsAdmin* model configurations to ensure they align with security best practices.

## Threat: [Exploiting Custom Actions with Insufficient Sanitization](./threats/exploiting_custom_actions_with_insufficient_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:** If developers implement custom actions *within RailsAdmin* that involve user input or interaction with external systems without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious code or commands *through these custom RailsAdmin actions*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the *RailsAdmin* interface, and potential compromise of external systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom Actions *within RailsAdmin*, Controller Logic *for custom RailsAdmin actions*, View Rendering for Custom Actions *within RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize all user input within custom actions *in RailsAdmin* to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom actions *for RailsAdmin*.
    *   Implement proper authorization and input validation for custom actions *within RailsAdmin*.
    *   Regularly review and audit the code for custom actions *in RailsAdmin*.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** *RailsAdmin* relies on other Ruby gems. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited *through the RailsAdmin interface*.
*   **Impact:** Various security issues depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service *exploitable via RailsAdmin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Gem Dependencies *of RailsAdmin*, Underlying Framework Components *used by RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep *RailsAdmin* and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities *in RailsAdmin's dependencies*.
    *   Regularly review security advisories for Rails and its ecosystem, paying attention to vulnerabilities affecting *RailsAdmin's dependencies*.

## Threat: [Exposed RailsAdmin Route in Production](./threats/exposed_railsadmin_route_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** If the *RailsAdmin* route is not properly protected in production, it could be publicly accessible, allowing unauthorized individuals to attempt to access the administrative interface *provided by RailsAdmin*.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface and potential for brute-force attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities *within RailsAdmin*.
*   **Affected Component:** Routing Configuration *related to RailsAdmin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the *RailsAdmin* route using authentication middleware that requires login.
    *   Consider using IP address restrictions or VPNs to limit access to authorized networks *for accessing RailsAdmin*.
    *   Ensure the *RailsAdmin* route is not publicly advertised or easily discoverable.
