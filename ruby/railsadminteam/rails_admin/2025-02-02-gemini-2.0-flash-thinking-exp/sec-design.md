# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, rails_admin, provides a Ruby on Rails engine that automatically generates an administration interface for Rails applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- To provide a user-friendly interface for managing application data and models.
- To reduce development time for building administration panels.
- To empower non-technical users to manage application content and settings.
- To simplify common administrative tasks such as CRUD operations on database records.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches due to unauthorized access to the administration interface.
- Data integrity issues resulting from accidental or malicious data modification through the admin panel.
- Operational disruptions caused by misconfiguration or misuse of the admin interface.
- Availability issues if the admin interface becomes a performance bottleneck or point of failure.
- Compliance risks if the admin interface does not adequately support audit logging and access controls required by regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Rails framework security features (e.g., CSRF protection, strong parameters, session management) - Implemented by the underlying Rails application framework.
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the Rails application - Implemented by the application that integrates rails_admin.
- security control: Input validation provided by Rails and application code - Implemented by Rails framework and application code.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on the integrating Rails application for primary authentication and authorization.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in gems and dependencies used by rails_admin.
- accepted risk: Security misconfigurations in the deployment environment of the Rails application.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to the rails_admin interface.
- security control: Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) within rails_admin to restrict access to sensitive data and actions based on user roles.
- security control: Implement comprehensive audit logging of all actions performed within rails_admin, including data access, modifications, and configuration changes.
- security control: Regularly perform security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the Rails application and rails_admin integration.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection mechanisms for the rails_admin login interface.
- security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- security control: Implement regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning for rails_admin and its dependencies.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users accessing rails_admin.
    - requirement: Integration with existing application authentication or a dedicated authentication system.
    - requirement: Support for strong password policies and password management.
    - requirement: Consider multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control to restrict access to specific features and data within rails_admin based on user roles.
    - requirement: Granular permissions to control access to models, actions (create, read, update, delete), and fields.
    - requirement: Clear definition and enforcement of authorization policies.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Robust input validation for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - requirement: Server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security.
    - requirement: Proper handling of file uploads and sanitization of uploaded content.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data, including passwords and API keys, using appropriate encryption methods.
    - requirement: Use of HTTPS for all communication between the user's browser and the rails_admin interface to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Secure handling of sensitive data in logs and during processing.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code for the Rails application and rails_admin integration.
2. Version Control System (VCS): Code is committed and pushed to a VCS like GitHub.
3. CI/CD System: A CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes in the VCS.
4. Build & Test: The CI/CD system builds the Rails application and runs automated tests (unit, integration, etc.). This includes building the rails_admin engine as part of the application.
5. SAST Scanners: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanners are integrated into the build process to analyze the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
6. Dependency Check & Vulnerability Scan: Tools are used to check dependencies (gems) for known vulnerabilities. This ensures that rails_admin and its dependencies are not introducing known security issues.
7. Artifact Store: Build artifacts, such as packaged gems or container images, are stored in an artifact store (e.g., Gem Registry, Container Registry). These artifacts are then used for deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Secure coding practices are followed by developers.
- security control: Code reviews are conducted to identify potential security flaws.
- security control: Automated SAST scanners are used to detect vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning is performed to identify vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Build artifacts are securely stored and accessed.
- security control: CI/CD pipeline is secured to prevent unauthorized modifications and access.
- security control: Immutable build process to ensure reproducibility and prevent tampering.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Management of application data: rails_admin is used to create, read, update, and delete critical application data, impacting all business processes that rely on this data.
- Application configuration management: rails_admin might be used to manage application settings and configurations, which can directly affect application behavior and security.
- User management (potentially): Depending on the application, rails_admin could be used to manage user accounts and permissions, impacting access control and security.

Data Sensitivity:
- Application data: The sensitivity of data managed through rails_admin depends on the specific application. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal data, financial records, or confidential business information.
- Configuration data: Application configuration data can be sensitive as it may include database credentials, API keys, and other security-related settings.
- User credentials (if managed): Usernames and password hashes are highly sensitive data that must be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
