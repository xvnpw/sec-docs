## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Gain Unauthorized Access to RailsAdmin Interface [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_gain_unauthorized_access_to_railsadmin_interface__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This is the primary goal for an attacker targeting RailsAdmin. Gaining unauthorized access bypasses the intended security controls and opens the door to further exploitation.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses (1.1)
    * Exploiting Authorization Weaknesses (1.2) (in case of misconfiguration leading to unauthenticated access)
* **Potential Impact:** Full administrative control over the application via RailsAdmin, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, system compromise, and denial of service.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong authentication mechanisms.
    * Enforce strict authorization policies.
    * Regularly audit access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Authentication Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_authentication_weaknesses__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers target weaknesses in the authentication process to bypass login requirements and gain access as an authorized user (typically an administrator).

    * **1.1.1 Default Credentials (if mistakenly left) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Using well-known default usernames and passwords that might be present in initial configurations or if administrators fail to change them.
        * **Impact:** Immediate and complete administrative access.
        * **Mitigation:**  Mandatory password changes upon initial setup, removal of default accounts, and regular security audits to check for default credentials.
    * **1.1.2 Brute-Force/Dictionary Attack on Login [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:**  Systematically trying numerous username and password combinations to guess valid credentials.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover, administrative access.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, CAPTCHA, and consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    * **1.1.4 Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in RailsAdmin (if any exist - check CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in RailsAdmin's authentication logic that allow bypassing the login process without valid credentials.
        * **Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication, administrative access.
        * **Mitigation:**  Regularly update RailsAdmin to the latest version, monitor security advisories and CVE databases, and promptly apply security patches.
    * **1.1.5 Weak Password Policies (application-level, but relevant if RailsAdmin uses shared auth) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Exploiting weak password policies (short passwords, lack of complexity requirements) to make brute-force or dictionary attacks more effective.
        * **Impact:** Increased likelihood of successful brute-force attacks, account compromise.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies across the entire application, including admin users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_authorization_weaknesses__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Even if an attacker gains authenticated access (legitimately or illegitimately), authorization weaknesses allow them to perform actions or access data beyond their intended privileges.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.2.1 Privilege Escalation within RailsAdmin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:**  Exploiting flaws in RailsAdmin's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or authorization logic to gain higher privileges than initially assigned.
