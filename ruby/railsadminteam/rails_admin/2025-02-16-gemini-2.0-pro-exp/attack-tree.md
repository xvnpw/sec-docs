## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RailsAdmin Vulnerabilities -> RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_railsadmin_vulnerabilities_-_rce.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the RailsAdmin code that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most severe type of vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium (if updates are delayed), High (if significantly outdated)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service)
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High (finding and exploiting a 0-day is extremely difficult; exploiting a known vulnerability depends on patch availability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires robust logging, intrusion detection systems, and potentially specialized security expertise)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep RailsAdmin and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, even within RailsAdmin's custom fields or actions.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting potential RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help detect and block malicious requests.
        *   Use a principle of least privilege for the web server process, limiting its access to only necessary resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization -> Weak/Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_-_weakdefault_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains administrative access by guessing or using default credentials that have not been changed.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (surprisingly common, especially in development, staging, or poorly maintained environments)
    *   **Impact:** High (full administrative access, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (brute-force or dictionary attacks are simple to execute)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (repeated failed login attempts are easily detectable with basic logging)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, regular password changes).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all RailsAdmin users.
        *   *Never* use default credentials in production environments. Change default passwords immediately after installation.
        *   Monitor login attempts and lock accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization -> Authentication Bypass (Misconfig)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_-_authentication_bypass__misconfig_.md)

*   **Description:**  A configuration error in RailsAdmin (e.g., in the `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb` file) effectively disables authentication, allowing anyone to access the administrative interface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a significant and specific configuration mistake)
    *   **Impact:** High (full administrative access, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service)
    *   **Effort:** Low (if the misconfiguration is present, exploitation is trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (once the misconfiguration is discovered, it's obvious; however, *finding* the misconfiguration might require careful review)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the `authenticate_with` block in the RailsAdmin initializer. Ensure it correctly implements the intended authentication logic.
        *   Use a configuration management tool to ensure consistent and secure configurations across environments.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on the RailsAdmin configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Misconfiguration -> Exposed Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_misconfiguration_-_exposed_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:**  RailsAdmin is misconfigured to display sensitive data (e.g., password hashes, API keys, database credentials) directly in the interface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a significant oversight in configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High (depending on the data exposed; passwords or API keys would be Very High, leading to further compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (simply viewing the RailsAdmin interface)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (the data is directly visible)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Carefully review the RailsAdmin configuration and model configurations. Ensure that sensitive fields are not displayed.
        *   Use appropriate field types (e.g., `password` instead of `string` for passwords).
        *   Customize the display of fields to redact or hide sensitive information.
        *   Store sensitive data securely (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets management system) and *never* directly in the database or code.
        *   Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any exposed sensitive data.
