# Threat Model Analysis for railsadminteam/rails_admin

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `rails_admin` dashboard without valid credentials. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in the authentication *integration* (e.g., misconfigured Devise, weak default passwords, session hijacking), or by directly accessing `rails_admin` routes if they are not properly protected *by the authentication system*. The core issue here is that `rails_admin` relies on an external authentication system, and if *that* system is flawed, `rails_admin` is vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the application's data and potentially the server itself, depending on the application's configuration and the attacker's capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rails_admin`'s main engine and routing (`RailsAdmin::Engine`, routing configuration), integration with authentication gems (e.g., Devise).  The vulnerability is in how `rails_admin` *uses* the authentication system, not necessarily in `rails_admin` itself, but the *impact* is directly on `rails_admin` access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust authentication system (e.g., Devise) with strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
        *   Ensure `rails_admin` is correctly mounted and protected by the authentication system.  Verify that *all* `rails_admin` routes require authentication.  This is a crucial `rails_admin`-specific configuration step.
        *   Use secure session management practices (secure cookies, HTTP-only flags, short session timeouts).
        *   Consider IP whitelisting or VPN access for the `rails_admin` interface. This significantly reduces the attack surface *for* `rails_admin`.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification (Tampering)](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited `rails_admin` access (or through a bypassed authorization check *within* `rails_admin`) modifies data they should not be able to. This could involve changing critical data, bypassing business logic, or injecting malicious content. The attacker might exploit weak *`rails_admin` authorization configurations* or vulnerabilities in *`rails_admin` custom actions*.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, integrity violations, potential for further attacks (e.g., XSS through injected content), business logic disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rails_admin`'s model configuration (`config.model`), field configurations (`fields`), custom actions (`RailsAdmin::Config::Actions`), and potentially the underlying ActiveRecord models *if* validations are insufficient *and* `rails_admin`'s authorization fails.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authorization using gems like CanCanCan or Pundit, defining granular permissions for each model and action *within the `rails_admin` context*. This is a key `rails_admin`-specific mitigation.
        *   Use `read_only` configurations *within `rails_admin`* for fields that should never be modified through the interface.
        *   Maintain robust model-level validations in your Rails application (this is a general defense, but it interacts with `rails_admin`).
        *   Audit all changes made *through `rails_admin`* using gems like `paper_trail` or `audited`.
        *   Validate all input received through *`rails_admin` custom actions*, even if it appears to be from a trusted source.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive information displayed *within the `rails_admin` interface*. This could include API keys, user credentials, internal IDs, or other confidential data that is inadvertently exposed through poorly configured *`rails_admin` field visibility* or *`rails_admin` custom actions*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, API access, potential for further attacks, privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rails_admin`'s model configuration (`config.model`), field configurations (`fields`), list views, show views, custom actions.  The vulnerability lies in how `rails_admin` *presents* data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure which fields are visible for each model *within `rails_admin`* using the `fields` option. Explicitly list only the necessary fields. This is a primary `rails_admin` configuration task.
        *   Avoid displaying sensitive information in `rails_admin` list views or show views.
        *   Implement data masking or redaction for sensitive fields *if they must be displayed within `rails_admin`*.
        *   Review and secure any *`rails_admin` custom actions* that might expose sensitive data.
        *   Ensure proper error handling to prevent information leakage in error messages (this is a general defense, but applies to `rails_admin`'s error output).

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `rails_admin` Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__rails_admin__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in `rails_admin` itself* (or a misconfiguration *of `rails_admin`*) to gain higher privileges than they should have. This could involve bypassing `rails_admin`'s authorization checks or gaining access to restricted `rails_admin` models or actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify data beyond authorized limits, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of `rails_admin`, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include `rails_admin`'s authorization logic (`RailsAdmin::Config.authorize_with`), `rails_admin` custom actions, or core `rails_admin` components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `rails_admin` updated to the latest version to address any known security vulnerabilities *in the gem itself*.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions *within `rails_admin`*.
        *   Regularly review `rails_admin`'s configuration and any custom code *added to `rails_admin`* for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct security audits of the application, *specifically including the `rails_admin` integration*.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) *within Rails Admin*](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__within_rails_admin.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker manipulates IDs or other parameters in `rails_admin` URLs or requests to access or modify objects they should not have access to. This is often due to insufficient authorization checks *within the context of `rails_admin`*.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to or modification of data belonging to other users or the system.
    * **Affected Component:**  `rails_admin`'s controllers and actions that handle object retrieval and modification based on IDs (`RailsAdmin::MainController#show`, `#edit`, `#update`, `#delete`), `rails_admin` custom actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks (e.g., CanCanCan, Pundit) *specifically configured for use with `rails_admin`* to ensure that users can only access objects they are permitted to.  Do not rely solely on authentication.
        *   Avoid exposing internal IDs directly in `rails_admin` URLs or forms.  Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
        *   Validate all parameters used to retrieve or modify objects *within `rails_admin`* to ensure they are within the allowed scope for the current user.
