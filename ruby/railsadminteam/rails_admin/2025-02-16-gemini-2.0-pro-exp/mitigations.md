## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Authorization within `rails_admin` (CanCanCan/Pundit Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_authorization_within__rails_admin___cancancanpundit_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install CanCanCan or Pundit:** Choose either CanCanCan or Pundit for authorization. Install the chosen gem.
    2.  **Define Abilities/Policies:**
        *   **CanCanCan:** Create an `Ability` class (usually `app/models/ability.rb`) that defines user permissions *specifically for `rails_admin` actions*. Use `can` and `cannot` methods to specify which actions users can perform on which models *within the `rails_admin` context*.  This is crucial: you're defining what's allowed *within the admin interface*, not the entire application.
            ```ruby
            class Ability
              include CanCan::Ability

              def initialize(user)
                user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)

                if user.role == 'editor'
                  can :manage, Article, :rails_admin => true # Can perform any action on Article *in rails_admin*
                  can :read, User, :rails_admin => true # Can only read User records *in rails_admin*
                  cannot :destroy, User, :rails_admin => true # Cannot delete User records *in rails_admin*
                elsif user.role == 'viewer'
                  can :read, :all, :rails_admin => true # Can read all models *in rails_admin*
                else
                  # No permissions for guest users in rails_admin
                end
              end
            end
            ```
        *   **Pundit:** Create policy classes for each model (e.g., `app/policies/article_policy.rb`). Define methods corresponding to `rails_admin` actions (e.g., `show?`, `create?`, `update?`, `destroy?`).  These methods return `true` or `false` based on the user and the resource, *specifically considering the `rails_admin` context*. You might need to add a context check within your policies.
            ```ruby
            class ArticlePolicy < ApplicationPolicy
              def rails_admin?(action) # Custom method to check for rails_admin context
                context[:controller].is_a?(RailsAdmin::MainController) && send("#{action}?")
              end

              def show?
                true # Everyone can view articles (even outside rails_admin)
              end

              def create?
                user.role == 'editor' || user.role == 'admin'
              end

              def update?
                create? # Same permissions as create
              end

              def destroy?
                user.role == 'admin'
              end
            end
            ```
    3.  **Configure `rails_admin` with Authorization:** In `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`, set `config.authorize_with` to use CanCanCan or Pundit.  For example:
        ```ruby
        config.authorize_with :cancancan # Or :pundit
        ```
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review the abilities/policies to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege *within `rails_admin`*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents authenticated users from performing actions they are not authorized to do *within `rails_admin`* (e.g., a "viewer" deleting records through the admin interface).  This is the core threat this mitigation addresses.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** While overall authentication is handled separately (e.g., by Devise), this ensures that even if a user *is* authenticated, they can't do anything in `rails_admin` without explicit permission.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced; users are limited to their defined permissions *within the `rails_admin` interface*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Provides a crucial layer of defense *within `rails_admin`*, ensuring that even authenticated users are restricted.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CanCanCan is implemented with abilities defined in `app/models/ability.rb`.
    *   `rails_admin` is configured to use CanCanCan in `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular (quarterly) reviews of the `Ability` class are not formally scheduled, specifically focusing on the `:rails_admin => true` context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused `rails_admin` Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused__rails_admin__features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unused Features:** Review the `rails_admin` documentation and identify features that are not being used in your application (e.g., history, bulk actions, specific model actions, export options).  This is a `rails_admin`-specific task.
    2.  **Disable in Configuration:** In `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`, use the configuration options to disable the identified features.  This is done *entirely within the `rails_admin` configuration*.
        ```ruby
        RailsAdmin.config do |config|
          config.actions do
            dashboard                     # mandatory
            index                         # mandatory
            new
            export  do
                except ['User', 'SensitiveModel'] #disable for some models
            end
            bulk_delete do
                except ['User'] #disable for some models
            end
            show
            edit
            delete
            # history_index # Disable history index
            # history_show # Disable history show
          end

          # config.excluded_models = ['SecretModel'] # Completely hide a model from rails_admin

          config.model 'Article' do
            edit do
              # exclude_fields :created_at, :updated_at # Hide fields within rails_admin
            end
          end
        end
        ```
    3.  **Test Functionality:** After disabling features, thoroughly test the remaining `rails_admin` functionality to ensure it works as expected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities in Unused Features (Unknown Severity):** Reduces the `rails_admin`-specific attack surface by removing potentially vulnerable code that is not being used.
    *   **Accidental Misuse (Low Severity):** Prevents users from accidentally triggering `rails_admin` actions that are not intended to be used.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced; fewer potential vulnerabilities *within `rails_admin`*.
    *   **Accidental Misuse:** Risk reduced; fewer actions available to users *within `rails_admin`*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   History features are disabled in `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`.
    *   Export is disabled for specific models in `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of *all* `rails_admin` features has not been conducted to identify *all* unused features.  This should be done periodically, focusing specifically on the `rails_admin` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Field Validation *within `rails_admin`* (Beyond Model Validations)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_field_validation_within__rails_admin___beyond_model_validations_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields:** Identify fields *within the `rails_admin` interface* that handle sensitive data or are particularly vulnerable to injection attacks.
    2.  **Add `rails_admin`-Specific Validations:** Within the `rails_admin` configuration (`config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`) for the relevant models and fields, use the `validates` option to add custom validation logic.  This validation is *specific to the `rails_admin` interface* and supplements model-level validations.
        ```ruby
        RailsAdmin.config do |config|
          config.model 'Article' do
            edit do
              field :title do
                validates do # This is rails_admin specific validation
                  length maximum: 100
                  format with: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+\z/, message: "Only letters, numbers, and spaces allowed"
                end
              end
              field :external_link, :string do
                validates do # This is rails_admin specific validation
                  format with: URI::regexp(%w(http https)), message: "Must be a valid URL"
                end
              end
            end
          end
        end
        ```
    3.  **Test Validations:** Thoroughly test the custom validations *within the `rails_admin` interface* to ensure they correctly reject invalid input and allow valid input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious JavaScript code from being injected into fields *through the `rails_admin` interface*.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** While Rails' ORM protects against most SQL injection, custom validations *within `rails_admin`* provide an extra layer of defense.
    *   **Invalid Data Input (Medium Severity):** Ensures that data entered *through `rails_admin`* conforms to specific formats and constraints.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced; custom validations *within `rails_admin`* can catch XSS attempts that might bypass model-level validations.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk further reduced (defense-in-depth) *specifically for input through `rails_admin`*.
    *   **Invalid Data:** Risk reduced; data quality is improved *for data entered via `rails_admin`*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic length validations are present on some text fields in `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive custom validations are not in place for all relevant fields *within the `rails_admin` configuration*.  A systematic review of all fields and the addition of appropriate validations (especially regular expressions for format validation) is needed, *specifically within the `rails_admin.rb` initializer*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Use of `formatted_value` *within `rails_admin`*](./mitigation_strategies/careful_use_of__formatted_value__within__rails_admin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid `formatted_value` When Possible:** Prefer using built-in `rails_admin` field types and formatting options instead of custom `formatted_value` implementations. This is a `rails_admin`-specific recommendation.
    2.  **If Necessary, Sanitize Thoroughly:** If you *must* use `formatted_value` *within a `rails_admin` configuration*, ensure that any user-provided data included in the output is properly escaped or sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  This sanitization happens *within the `rails_admin` configuration*.
        ```ruby
        RailsAdmin.config do |config|
          config.model 'Comment' do
            list do
              field :body do
                formatted_value do # This is within the rails_admin configuration
                  # VERY BAD (vulnerable to XSS):
                  # bindings[:view].raw(value)

                  # BETTER (escapes HTML):
                  bindings[:view].h(value)

                  # BEST (allows specific HTML tags):
                  # bindings[:view].sanitize(value, tags: %w(strong em a), attributes: %w(href))
                end
              end
            end
          end
        end
        ```
    3.  **Test for XSS:** After implementing `formatted_value` *within `rails_admin`*, test for XSS vulnerabilities by attempting to inject malicious JavaScript code into the relevant fields *through the `rails_admin` interface*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious JavaScript code from being executed in the context of the `rails_admin` interface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced if `formatted_value` is used correctly with proper sanitization *within `rails_admin`*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `formatted_value` is *not* currently used in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A policy should be documented to *strongly discourage* the use of `formatted_value` within `rails_admin` configurations unless absolutely necessary and with thorough sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `rails_admin` Gem Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__rails_admin__gem_updated.md)

*   **Description:** This is directly related to the security of the `rails_admin` gem itself.
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the `rails_admin` GitHub repository or RubyGems page for new releases.
    2.  **Update the Gem:** When a new version is available, update the `rails_admin` gem in your `Gemfile` and run `bundle update rails_admin`.
    3.  **Test After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test `rails_admin` and your application to ensure that the update did not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `rails_admin` (Variable Severity):** Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that have been discovered and fixed *specifically within the `rails_admin` gem*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced; patched versions address known security issues *within `rails_admin`*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `Gemfile` specifies `rails_admin`, and `bundle update` is run regularly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for monitoring `rails_admin` releases (e.g., subscribing to release notifications) is not in place.
