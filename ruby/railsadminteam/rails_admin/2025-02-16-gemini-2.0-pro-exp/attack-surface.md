# Attack Surface Analysis for railsadminteam/rails_admin

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the `rails_admin` dashboard without valid credentials.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** `rails_admin` provides a centralized administrative interface, which, if unprotected, becomes a single point of entry for attackers.  This is *the* defining characteristic of the risk related to `rails_admin`.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the `/admin` route and, due to missing authentication configuration, gains full access to the dashboard.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the application's data and potentially the server itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Authentication:** Use a strong authentication mechanism like Devise, ensuring it's correctly integrated with `rails_admin` using `config.authenticate_with`.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all `rails_admin` users.
    *   **Rate Limiting & Account Lockout:** Implement measures to prevent brute-force attacks against the `rails_admin` login.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  An authenticated user (or unauthenticated, if authentication is bypassed) accessing `rails_admin` features or data they are not authorized to access.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** `rails_admin`'s core functionality is to provide granular access control.  Misconfiguration *within* `rails_admin`'s authorization setup is the direct cause of this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A user with "editor" role can access and delete user accounts due to an improperly configured authorization rule *within* `rails_admin`'s integration with CanCanCan or Pundit.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification/deletion, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Authorization:** Use CanCanCan or Pundit, meticulously defining access rules for each model and action *within* `rails_admin` using `config.authorize_with`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and test authorization rules *specifically within the context of rails_admin*.
    *   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests to verify authorization logic for `rails_admin` access.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (within `rails_admin`)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss___within__rails_admin__.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `rails_admin` interface itself.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** Vulnerabilities *within* `rails_admin`'s code (especially custom actions/fields) or in unpatched versions of the gem are the direct source of this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *custom `rails_admin` action* to inject a script that steals session cookies.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection, data theft – all within the context of other `rails_admin` users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `rails_admin` Updated:** This is paramount.  Regular updates patch vulnerabilities *within the gem itself*.
    *   **Input Sanitization & Output Encoding:**  Meticulously sanitize input and encode output in *custom `rails_admin` actions and fields*. Avoid `html_safe`.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Can help mitigate, but the primary focus should be on patching and secure coding within `rails_admin` customizations.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (within `rails_admin`)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf___within__rails_admin__.md)

*   **Description:**  Tricking an authenticated `rails_admin` user into performing unintended actions.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** The risk arises from *custom actions within `rails_admin`* that bypass or misconfigure Rails' built-in CSRF protection.  It's a vulnerability *within the rails_admin context*.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a link that, when clicked by a logged-in `rails_admin` user, triggers a request to a *custom `rails_admin` action* that deletes data, exploiting a missing CSRF token.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification/deletion, account compromise – all through actions performed *within `rails_admin`*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure CSRF Protection:** Verify that *all `rails_admin` actions, especially custom ones*, correctly use Rails' CSRF protection. Do *not* disable it.
    *   **Test Custom Actions:** Thoroughly test *custom `rails_admin` actions* for CSRF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched `rails_admin` Gem](./attack_surfaces/unpatched__rails_admin__gem.md)

*   **Description:**  Running an outdated version of the `rails_admin` gem with known vulnerabilities.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability of using the `rails_admin` gem itself.  The gem *is* the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an *older version of `rails_admin`* to gain access.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but can range from information disclosure to complete compromise *through the `rails_admin` interface*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update the `rails_admin` gem to the latest stable release. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Dependency Monitoring:** Use tools like Bundler-audit or Dependabot.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories related to `rails_admin`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads (via associated gems, *within the rails_admin context*)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads__via_associated_gems__within_the_rails_admin_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload handling *initiated through the rails_admin interface*.
*   **How `rails_admin` Contributes:** While the vulnerability is often in the underlying file upload library, `rails_admin` *provides the interface* through which the exploit occurs. The attack is performed *through* `rails_admin`.
*   **Example:** An attacker, *using the rails_admin file upload interface*, uploads a malicious script disguised as an image.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise – all stemming from an action performed *within rails_admin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Validate file types based on content, not extensions, *within the context of the rails_admin upload process*.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files securely, ideally outside the web root.
    *   **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal, *as part of the rails_admin upload handling*.
    *   **File Upload Library Updates:** Keep the file upload library updated.
    *   **Anti-Virus Scanning:** Consider scanning files uploaded *through rails_admin*.
    * **Limit File Size:** Enforce reasonable limits of uploaded files *within the rails_admin context*.
