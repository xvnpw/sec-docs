*   **Threat:** Accidental Data Creation or Modification in Production
    *   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration or accidental execution of test code in a production environment, FactoryBot could be used to create or modify data in the live production database. An attacker gaining control of the deployment process or exploiting a vulnerability allowing code execution could intentionally trigger this *by leveraging FactoryBot's data creation capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, application instability, and potential financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** FactoryBot's `create` and `update` methods (or similar persistence methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly separate development, staging, and production environments.
        *   Implement robust deployment pipelines with checks to prevent test code from being deployed to production.
        *   Disable or remove FactoryBot or any test-related code from production builds.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for production environments.
        *   Regularly audit production systems for unexpected data modifications.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials in FactoryBot Configuration
    *   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly hardcode database credentials or other sensitive information directly within FactoryBot configuration files or factory definitions. An attacker gaining access to the codebase (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a repository vulnerability) could then retrieve these credentials *directly from FactoryBot's configuration*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to development or testing databases, potentially leading to data breaches or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** FactoryBot configuration files (e.g., `rails_helper.rb`, factory files) or inline configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding any sensitive information in FactoryBot configuration or factory definitions.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools to manage database credentials.
        *   Restrict access to codebase repositories and configuration files.
        *   Implement secrets scanning tools to detect accidentally committed credentials.
