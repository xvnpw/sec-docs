*   **Description:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Factory Definitions
    *   **How FactoryBot Contributes:** Factory definitions define the attributes of created objects. Developers might inadvertently hardcode sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) directly within these definitions for testing purposes.
    *   **Example:** A factory for a `User` model includes `password: 'supersecret'` directly in the attributes hash. This password is now stored in the codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials if the codebase is compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in factory definitions.
        *   Use secure methods for generating or retrieving test data, such as:
            *   Using `Faker` gem for realistic but non-sensitive data.
            *   Retrieving test credentials from secure environment variables or configuration files.
            *   Using dedicated test data fixtures that are not part of the main codebase.
        *   Regularly audit factory definitions for hardcoded secrets.

*   **Description:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Factory Callbacks
    *   **How FactoryBot Contributes:** FactoryBot allows defining callbacks (`before(:create)`, `after(:create)`, etc.) that execute arbitrary Ruby code during object creation. If a malicious actor can modify factory definitions, they can inject malicious code into these callbacks.
    *   **Example:** A compromised developer account modifies a factory to include an `after(:create)` callback that executes a system command to create a backdoor user.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to modify factory definition files.
        *   Implement strict code review processes for any changes to factory files.
        *   Utilize version control and track changes to factory definitions.
        *   Regularly audit factory definitions for suspicious or unexpected code in callbacks.

*   **Description:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in FactoryBot or its Dependencies
    *   **How FactoryBot Contributes:** Like any other gem, FactoryBot relies on other Ruby gems. Vulnerabilities in FactoryBot itself or its dependencies can introduce security risks.
    *   **Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in a dependency of FactoryBot that allows for remote code execution. If the application uses an outdated version of FactoryBot, it is vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various security breaches, including remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update FactoryBot and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for FactoryBot and its dependencies.
