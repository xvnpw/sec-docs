# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for forem/forem

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Server-Side Markdown and HTML Sanitization within Forem](./mitigation_strategies/strict_server-side_markdown_and_html_sanitization_within_forem.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Forem's Sanitization Implementation:** Inspect the Forem codebase to identify the sanitization library used (likely in the backend, potentially Ruby).
        2.  **Analyze Sanitization Configuration:** Examine how the sanitization library is configured within Forem. Determine the allowed HTML tags, attributes, and URL schemes.
        3.  **Strengthen Sanitization Rules (If Necessary):** If the default configuration is not sufficiently strict, adjust it to be more restrictive.  Specifically, ensure removal of potentially dangerous tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<form>`, `<style>`, and event handlers. Whitelist only essential tags and attributes for Forem's functionality.
        4.  **Verify Sanitization Across Forem Features:** Confirm that sanitization is consistently applied in all Forem features that handle user-generated Markdown or HTML content (articles, comments, profile descriptions, etc.).
        5.  **Regularly Update Forem and Dependencies:** Keep Forem and its dependencies (including the sanitization library) updated to the latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities in Markdown/HTML parsing or sanitization.
        6.  **Testing with Forem Context:** Test the sanitization specifically within the Forem application using payloads relevant to Forem's features and Markdown rendering.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (Persistent) (High Severity):** Malicious scripts injected into Forem content are stored and executed when users view Forem pages.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (Medium Severity):**  While primarily targeting stored XSS, robust Forem sanitization also acts as a defense-in-depth layer against reflected XSS if input handling elsewhere in Forem is flawed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Stored XSS in Forem:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents stored XSS within the Forem platform by removing malicious code before persistence and rendering.
        *   **Reflected XSS in Forem:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk as a secondary defense layer within Forem.
