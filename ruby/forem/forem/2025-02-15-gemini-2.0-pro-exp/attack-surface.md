# Attack Surface Analysis for forem/forem

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Liquid Tag Exploitation (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_liquid_tag_exploitation__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Liquid templates, potentially achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's core templating system relies on Liquid.  The presence of custom Liquid tags, and the processing of user-supplied data *within* Liquid contexts, are Forem-specific design choices that create this vulnerability. This is *not* a generic web application vulnerability; it's tied to Forem's use of Liquid.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a post containing a specially designed Liquid tag that, due to a flaw in Forem's Liquid handling or a custom tag's implementation, executes arbitrary shell commands on the server.  `{% raw %}{% assign x = "system('id')" %}{% endraw %}` (Illustrative; real exploits are more complex).
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data theft, data destruction, potential lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Forem):**
        *   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization:** Rigorous validation and sanitization of *all* user input processed by Liquid, using a whitelist approach. This is *crucial* for any data entering a Liquid context.
        *   **Liquid Sandbox:** Execute Liquid rendering in a *strongly* sandboxed environment with *extremely* limited privileges.  This should prevent access to the file system, network, and system commands.  A dedicated, isolated rendering service is highly recommended.
        *   **Disable Dangerous Tags:**  Completely disable or severely restrict any Liquid tags that could potentially be abused for code execution (e.g., those interacting with the file system or external processes).  Review *all* built-in and custom tags for potential risks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits & Code Review:** Mandatory, frequent security audits and code reviews specifically targeting the Liquid implementation and all custom tag logic.
    *   **User (Admin):**
        *   **Restrict Custom Tag Creation:**  *Only* trusted administrators should be allowed to create or modify custom Liquid tags.  Disable this feature for regular users.
        *   **Monitor Logs:**  Actively monitor server logs for any unusual Liquid tag usage, errors, or suspicious activity related to template rendering.

## Attack Surface: [2. Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (Forem-Specific API)](./attack_surfaces/2__pluginextension_vulnerabilities__forem-specific_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party Forem plugins or extensions, specifically exploiting Forem's plugin API, are used to compromise the platform.
*   **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's plugin architecture and the API it provides to plugins are the direct source of this risk.  The *way* Forem interacts with plugins, the permissions granted to them, and the data exposed to them are all Forem-specific concerns.
*   **Example:** A plugin uses a Forem API endpoint in an insecure way, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability *because of how Forem handles that API call*.  Or, a plugin gains excessive permissions due to a flaw in Forem's permission model.
*   **Impact:** Highly variable, depending on the plugin and the exploited vulnerability.  Could range from data leaks to complete server compromise (if the plugin has extensive access).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the plugin)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Forem):**
        *   **Secure Plugin API Design:**  Design the plugin API with security in mind from the outset.  Follow the principle of least privilege, granting plugins only the *minimum* necessary permissions.
        *   **Input Validation (API Level):**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *within* Forem's API endpoints, even if the plugin is expected to handle validation.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Plugin Security Guidelines & Review:**  Provide *detailed* security guidelines for plugin developers and enforce a *strict* security review process for all submitted plugins.  This review must focus on the plugin's interaction with the Forem API.
        *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate plugins and limit their potential impact on the core Forem system. This is a complex but potentially very effective mitigation.
    *   **User (Admin):**
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:**  Install plugins *only* from trusted sources and reputable developers with a proven track record of security.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Disable Unused Plugins:**  Disable or completely remove any plugins that are not actively being used. This reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Monitor Plugin Activity:** Monitor logs and system behavior for any unusual activity related to plugins.
