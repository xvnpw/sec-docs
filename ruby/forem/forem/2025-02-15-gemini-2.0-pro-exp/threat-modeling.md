# Threat Model Analysis for forem/forem

## Threat: [Third-Party Authentication Bypass](./threats/third-party_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious response mimicking a successful authentication from a supported provider (GitHub, Twitter, etc.) to bypass Forem's authentication checks and gain access to an account without valid credentials. This exploits how Forem *handles* the response from the provider, not a flaw in the provider itself.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, impersonation of legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** `app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb` (and related authentication service objects/modules).  The specific methods handling callbacks from each provider (e.g., `github`, `twitter`, etc.) are the most critical.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Rigorously validate all data received from the authentication provider, including signatures, timestamps, and user identifiers.  Do not rely solely on the provider's response. Use a well-vetted OAuth/OpenID Connect library and ensure it's configured correctly. Implement robust error handling and logging for authentication failures.
    *   **User:** Use strong, unique passwords for third-party accounts. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on the third-party provider.

## Threat: [Admin/Moderator Privilege Escalation via Role Bypass](./threats/adminmoderator_privilege_escalation_via_role_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with a regular user account exploits a flaw in Forem's custom role-based access control (RBAC) logic to gain administrative or moderator privileges. This could involve manipulating parameters, exploiting race conditions, or bypassing checks within Forem's code.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Forem instance, ability to delete content, ban users, modify settings, and potentially access sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** `app/models/user.rb` (role definitions), `app/policies/` (Pundit policies for various resources), and controllers/actions that perform administrative tasks (e.g., `app/controllers/admin/`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly test all permission checks, especially those related to administrative actions. Use a consistent and well-defined authorization framework (Pundit).  Ensure that all administrative actions are properly guarded by policy checks.  Avoid "magic" roles or permissions that bypass standard checks. Implement robust logging of all authorization decisions.
    *   **User:** (Limited mitigation from the user side, as this is a code-level issue).

## Threat: [Liquid Template Injection](./threats/liquid_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid code into a field that is rendered using Liquid templates (e.g., article body, profile description). This exploits vulnerabilities in Forem's *implementation* of Liquid or insecure custom Liquid tags.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data exfiltration, content manipulation, potentially server-side code execution (if custom tags are extremely vulnerable).
*   **Affected Component:** `app/views/` (Liquid templates), `app/liquid/` (custom Liquid tags and filters), and any controllers/models that process user input rendered with Liquid.  Specifically, areas where user-provided content is rendered *without* proper sanitization *before* being passed to Liquid.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Strictly limit the available Liquid tags and filters to the minimum necessary.  Thoroughly sanitize and validate *all* user-provided input *before* it's used in Liquid templates.  Avoid creating custom Liquid tags unless absolutely necessary, and if you do, rigorously audit them for security vulnerabilities. Consider using a sandboxed environment for Liquid rendering.
    *   **User:** (Limited mitigation, as this is primarily a code-level issue). Avoid pasting untrusted code snippets into Forem fields.

## Threat: [Internal API Exposure](./threats/internal_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and accesses internal APIs used by Forem that are not intended for public use. These APIs might lack proper authentication or authorization, allowing the attacker to retrieve sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `app/controllers/api/` (API controllers), `config/routes.rb` (API route definitions), and any services or models that expose internal APIs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Clearly define and document all internal APIs. Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints, even those considered "internal." Use API keys, tokens, or other secure authentication mechanisms. Regularly review and audit API security. Avoid exposing internal APIs to the public internet.
    *   **User:** (Limited mitigation, as this is primarily a code-level issue).

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads (Forem-Specific)](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads__forem-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a file that exceeds size limits or is of an unsupported type, exploiting weaknesses in Forem's file upload handling. This could lead to denial of service (storage exhaustion) or the upload of malicious files (e.g., disguised executables) that could be executed if misconfigured.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution, data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `app/uploaders/` (file uploaders), `app/controllers/` (controllers handling file uploads), `app/models/` (models associated with uploaded files), and any configuration related to file storage (e.g., Active Storage configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Enforce strict limits on file sizes and types *on the server-side*. Validate file contents (e.g., using file signatures) to prevent malicious uploads. Store uploaded files securely, preferably outside the web root or using a dedicated file storage service (e.g., AWS S3). Configure the file storage service with appropriate security settings (e.g., restricting public access).
    *   **User:** (Limited mitigation, as this is primarily a code-level issue). Avoid uploading files from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [IDOR in Forem-Specific Functionality](./threats/idor_in_forem-specific_functionality.md)

* **Description:** An attacker modifies a URL parameter (e.g., an article ID, comment ID, user ID) to access or modify data they should not have access to. This exploits a lack of proper authorization checks *within Forem's custom logic*.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of data, potential for privilege escalation.
* **Affected Component:** Any controller action that uses parameters to retrieve or modify data, particularly those related to Forem's core features (articles, comments, users, etc.). Examples include `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb`, `app/controllers/comments_controller.rb`, `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:** Avoid exposing direct object references (e.g., database IDs) in URLs or API responses. Use indirect object references (e.g., random tokens, slugs) whenever possible. Implement robust access control checks *in every controller action* that retrieves or modifies data based on a parameter. Ensure that users can only access or modify data they are authorized to, based on their role and ownership. Use an authorization framework (like Pundit) to centralize and enforce these checks.
    * **User:** (Limited mitigation, as this is primarily a code-level issue).

## Threat: [Private Information Leakage in Public Profiles/APIs](./threats/private_information_leakage_in_public_profilesapis.md)

* **Description:** Forem inadvertently exposes private user information (e.g., email addresses, IP addresses, internal IDs) in publicly accessible profiles or API responses due to a bug or misconfiguration in Forem's code.
* **Impact:** Privacy violation, potential for doxing or targeted attacks.
* **Affected Component:** `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` (profile display), `app/serializers/` (API serializers), `app/views/users/` (profile views), and any other components that handle user data display.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:** Thoroughly review all code that displays user data, including profile views and API responses. Ensure that only intended information is exposed. Implement strict access controls on user data. Use data sanitization and filtering techniques to prevent accidental leakage. Regularly audit data exposure points. Use a well-defined data model with clear distinctions between public and private attributes.
    * **User:** Be mindful of the information you share on your profile. Use privacy settings to control the visibility of your information.
