# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for forem/forem

## Mitigation Strategy: [Forem-Specific Code Review and Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/forem-specific_code_review_and_analysis.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mandatory Code Reviews (Forem-Focused):** Require code reviews for *all* changes to the Forem codebase, including custom modifications, extensions, and *especially* any changes to core Forem files.
2.  **Security-Focused Reviewers:** Designate developers with security expertise to participate in reviews, focusing on Forem's security-relevant areas.
3.  **Forem-Specific Checklist:** Create a code review checklist that *specifically* addresses Forem's architecture and potential vulnerabilities. This checklist *must* include:
    *   **Input Validation:** Thorough checks for *all* user-supplied data within Forem's context (articles, comments, profiles, settings, API calls).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Review of Forem's authentication and authorization logic, ensuring proper access controls for all features and resources.
    *   **Liquid Templating Security:**  *Crucial for Forem*.  Rigorous review of all uses of Liquid templates, ensuring:
        *   Proper escaping using `escape`, `strip_html`, and other appropriate filters.
        *   Avoidance of `raw` unless absolutely necessary and with *extreme* caution and thorough sanitization.
        *   Understanding of Forem's custom Liquid tags and filters and their security implications.
    *   **Forem's Data Model:**  Review how data is stored and retrieved, paying attention to sensitive data handling and potential data leakage.
    *   **Forem's API:**  Review of API endpoints for proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
    *   **Forem's Feature Interactions:**  Consider how different Forem features interact and potential security implications (e.g., how comments interact with articles, how user roles affect permissions).
4.  **Static Analysis (Forem-Tailored):** Integrate static analysis tools (Brakeman for Ruby, ESLint with security plugins for JavaScript) into the CI/CD pipeline.
5.  **Custom Static Analysis Rules (Forem-Specific):**  *Crucially*, configure the static analysis tools with *custom rules* tailored to Forem's coding patterns and potential vulnerabilities.  Examples:
    *   Flag potentially unsafe uses of `raw` in Liquid templates *within Forem's specific template files*.
    *   Flag insecure database queries that might bypass Forem's intended access controls.
    *   Flag missing authorization checks in controllers or helpers specific to Forem's features.
    *   Flag potential issues with Forem's custom helper methods.
6.  **Dynamic Analysis (Forem Feature Targeting):** Regularly perform dynamic analysis (e.g., OWASP ZAP) with test cases *specifically designed* to target Forem's features:
    *   Article creation, editing, and commenting (with various malicious payloads).
    *   User registration and profile management (testing different input types and edge cases).
    *   Forem's search functionality (for potential injection vulnerabilities).
    *   Forem's API endpoints (with unexpected or malformed requests).
    *   *Any custom features or integrations you've added to your Forem instance*.
7.  **Security Test Suite (Forem Feature Coverage):** Develop and maintain a suite of automated security tests that *specifically* cover Forem's core features and common attack vectors *within the context of Forem's functionality*.  This includes:
    *   Tests for XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and other web vulnerabilities *within Forem's specific forms and data handling*.
    *   Tests for authorization bypasses (e.g., can a regular user access admin-only features in Forem?).
    *   Tests for data leakage (e.g., are private user details exposed in Forem's API responses?).
    *   Tests for rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms *within Forem's controllers*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Logic Errors (High/Medium):** Flaws in Forem's *specific* code logic.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Critical/High):** Missing or insufficient input validation *within Forem's controllers, models, and views*.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass (Critical/High):** Vulnerabilities allowing users to bypass Forem's authentication or authorization.
*   **Data Leakage (High/Medium):** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data *through Forem's features or API*.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (High):** Accessing Forem objects (articles, users) without proper authorization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):**  Injection of malicious scripts *via Forem's content submission features*.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High):**  Exploiting Forem's features to make unintended requests.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (Critical):**  Injection of malicious SQL code *through Forem's data input points*.

**Impact:**
*   **All Threats:** Significantly reduces the likelihood of introducing new vulnerabilities *specific to Forem* and helps identify existing ones. The impact is very high, as it directly addresses the core codebase.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Forem has a code review process (via GitHub pull requests).
*   Forem uses Rubocop (but not security-focused).
*   Forem has a test suite (but security coverage is not explicitly documented or comprehensive for Forem-specific risks).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formalized security-focused code review checklist *tailored to Forem's architecture*.
*   Designated security reviewers with Forem expertise.
*   Integration of Brakeman and ESLint (with security plugins) into CI/CD *with build failure thresholds*.
*   *Custom static analysis rules specific to Forem's code patterns and potential vulnerabilities*.
*   Regular dynamic analysis (DAST) *with test cases specifically targeting Forem's features*.
*   Comprehensive, documented security test suite *covering Forem's features and common attack vectors within Forem's context*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of User-Generated Content within Forem](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_user-generated_content_within_forem.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation (Forem Controllers/Models):** Implement strict server-side input validation *within Forem's controllers and models* for *all* user-generated content:
    *   Validate data types, lengths, allowed characters, and formats *specifically for each Forem field* (article title, body, comment text, profile fields, etc.).
    *   Use Forem's existing validation mechanisms where appropriate, but *extend them* to be more comprehensive and security-focused.
2.  **Input Sanitization (Forem Helpers/Views):** Sanitize user input *within Forem's helpers and views* to remove or encode potentially malicious characters.  Use:
    *   HTML escaping (to prevent XSS) *consistently throughout Forem's views*.
    *   SQL escaping (to prevent SQL injection) *wherever raw SQL is used (though Forem's ActiveRecord should handle most of this)*.
    *   URL encoding *where appropriate within Forem*.
3.  **Output Encoding (Forem Views):**  *Consistently* encode user-generated content when displaying it in Forem's web pages to prevent XSS.  Use appropriate encoding for the context (HTML, JavaScript).
4.  **Liquid Template Security (Forem-Specific):**  *This is critical for Forem*.  Within Forem's Liquid templates:
    *   *Always* use Liquid's built-in filters (`escape`, `strip_html`, etc.) to escape user-supplied data.
    *   *Avoid `raw` unless absolutely necessary*, and only after *thorough* sanitization and a *very strong justification*.
    *   Review and potentially modify Forem's custom Liquid tags and filters for security.
    *   Consider using a stricter Liquid configuration (if possible within Forem) to limit available tags and filters.
5.  **Rate Limiting (Forem Controllers):** Implement and *fine-tune* rate limiting *within Forem's controllers* to prevent abuse of content submission features (e.g., excessive commenting, article submissions, API calls).  This should be *specific to Forem's features*.
6.  **Content Moderation (Forem Logic):** Implement or enhance Forem's content moderation system. This could involve:
    *   Modifying Forem's models and controllers to support manual or automated content review and approval.
    *   Integrating with Forem's existing moderation features (if any) and extending them.
7.  **Reputation System (Forem Models/Controllers):** Consider implementing a reputation system *within Forem's models and controllers* to identify and flag potentially malicious users.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Injection of malicious scripts *via Forem's content submission*.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (Critical):** Injection of malicious SQL *via Forem's data input*.
*   **Spam and Phishing (Medium):** Submission of unwanted content *through Forem*.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Abuse of Forem's content features.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS and SQLi:** Significantly reduces the risk of these critical vulnerabilities *within Forem*.
*   **Spam/Phishing/DoS:** Reduces unwanted content and abuse *within Forem*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Forem uses HTML sanitization (the `sanitize` helper) in *some* areas.
*   Forem uses ActiveRecord (which helps with SQLi, *if used correctly*).
*   Forem has *some* basic rate limiting.
*   Forem has *basic* spam filtering.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive, documented server-side input validation *for all user-generated content fields within Forem's models and controllers*.
*   *Consistent* use of output encoding *throughout Forem's views*.
*   *Rigorous and documented security review and hardening of Forem's Liquid template usage*.
*   Formalized content moderation system *integrated within Forem's logic*.
*   Reputation system *built into Forem's models and controllers*.
*   Fine-tuned rate limiting *specific to each of Forem's features*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Forem Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_forem_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Environment Variables (Forem Deployment):** Store *all* sensitive Forem configuration values (database credentials, API keys, secret keys, etc.) as environment variables.  *Never* store these in Forem's codebase.
2.  **Configuration Validation (Forem Code):** Implement checks *within Forem's code* (e.g., in initializers) to ensure that all required configuration settings are present and have valid values.  *Fail fast* if configuration is invalid.
3.  **Secure Defaults (Forem Codebase):** Ensure that Forem's *default* configuration settings (in `config/` files, etc.) are secure.  Review and adjust these defaults as needed.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Forem Database Setup):** Create a dedicated database user for Forem with *only* the necessary permissions on the required tables.  *Do not use the root database user*. This is configured during Forem's setup, but is directly related to Forem's database interaction.
5. **Review and Harden Forem specific settings:**
    * `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Ensure this is a strong, randomly generated value, and *never* committed to the codebase. This is crucial for Rails security.
    * Forem's email configuration: Prevent open relay and ensure secure email handling.
    * Forem's rate limiting settings: Fine-tune these to prevent abuse.
    * Forem's Content Security Policy (CSP) settings (if present, or implement one): Mitigate XSS.
    * HTTPS settings (within Forem's configuration): Enforce HTTPS and use strong ciphers.
    * Any settings related to Forem's third-party integrations (OAuth providers, etc.): Ensure these are configured securely.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Critical):** Accidental or malicious exposure of sensitive credentials *used by Forem*.
*   **Configuration Errors (High/Medium):** Misconfigurations *within Forem* that weaken security.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Attackers gaining elevated privileges due to misconfigured Forem database permissions.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Eliminates the risk of storing secrets in Forem's code.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Reduces misconfigurations *within Forem*.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Limits damage from compromised accounts *within Forem's context*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Forem uses environment variables for *some* settings.
*   Forem's documentation *recommends* using environment variables.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive configuration validation checks *within Forem's code*.
*   Documented secure default configuration settings *for all of Forem's options*.
*   Explicit documentation and enforcement of the principle of least privilege for Forem's database user.
