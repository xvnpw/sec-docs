# Attack Surface Analysis for forem/forem

## Attack Surface: [Markdown/Rich Text Injection](./attack_surfaces/markdownrich_text_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious users inject code or markup within user-generated content (posts, comments, profiles) that is then rendered by other users' browsers.
*   **How Forem Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Forem's reliance on Markdown and potentially a rich text editor for user content creation provides the entry point for injecting malicious code. The rendering engine used by Forem is responsible for parsing and displaying this content.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a post containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, when viewed by another user, executes the JavaScript, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and potentially access to sensitive user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side sanitization and escaping of all user-generated content before rendering. Utilize a well-vetted and regularly updated Markdown parsing library with strong XSS prevention mechanisms. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Users:**  Be cautious about clicking on links or interacting with content from untrusted sources, even within the Forem platform.

## Attack Surface: [Image/File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/imagefile_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Users upload files (images, potentially other media) that are not properly validated, leading to potential security risks.
*   **How Forem Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Forem allows users to upload images for avatars, post media, and potentially other purposes. The server-side handling of these uploads (storage, processing, and serving) is where vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example:** A malicious user uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library, allowing for remote code execution on the server. Alternatively, uploading a file with a malicious extension that the server executes.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service, storage exhaustion, serving of malware to other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension. Utilize secure and updated image processing libraries. Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a separate, restricted mechanism. Implement anti-virus scanning on uploaded files.
    *   **Users:** Be mindful of the files you upload and ensure they come from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Profile Field Injection](./attack_surfaces/custom_profile_field_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If Forem allows for custom profile fields, users might be able to inject malicious code or content into these fields.
*   **How Forem Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  The ability for users to define and populate custom profile fields introduces a new input vector that needs careful sanitization and handling.
*   **Example:** A user adds a custom profile field with the value `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` which, when another user views their profile, executes the JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to persistent compromise of user accounts viewing the profile.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Treat custom profile fields as user-generated content and apply the same robust sanitization and escaping techniques used for posts and comments. Enforce input validation rules on custom field types and lengths.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about the information you input into custom profile fields and avoid entering potentially executable code.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse and Lack of Rate Limiting (Specific to Forem's API)](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse_and_lack_of_rate_limiting__specific_to_forem's_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  If Forem exposes an API, insufficient rate limiting or authentication flaws can allow malicious actors to abuse the API.
*   **How Forem Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Forem's API endpoints, designed for programmatic access, can be targeted for various malicious activities if not properly secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly calls an API endpoint to create new accounts, overwhelming the system or consuming resources. Alternatively, an API endpoint without proper authentication could allow unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, unauthorized access to data, potential for data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Enforce strict rate limiting based on IP address, user, or API key. Regularly monitor API usage for suspicious activity. Validate all input received by the API.
    *   **Users:** If interacting with the Forem API, ensure you are using secure authentication methods and are aware of any rate limits.
