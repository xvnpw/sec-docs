## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the Forem platform, an open-source platform for building online communities. This document is intended to serve as a foundational resource for subsequent threat modeling activities. It offers a comprehensive overview of the system's components, data flow, and underlying technologies, providing the necessary context for identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Project Overview

Forem is a multifaceted platform engineered for the creation and management of online communities. Its feature set encompasses user account management, diverse content creation capabilities (including articles and discussions), rich social interaction features (comments, likes, follows, reactions), and robust community moderation tools. The platform's design emphasizes extensibility and customization, allowing for tailoring to specific community needs.

## 3. System Architecture

The Forem platform adopts a traditional, primarily monolithic web application architecture, characterized by a clear separation of concerns across distinct layers.

*   **Presentation Layer:** Responsible for rendering the user interface and managing user interactions. This layer predominantly uses server-side rendered HTML, enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic user interface elements and interactive features.
*   **Application Layer:** Encompasses the core business logic, request routing, and primary functionalities of the platform. This layer is implemented using the Ruby on Rails framework, adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
*   **Data Layer:** Manages the persistence and retrieval of data. This layer primarily interacts with a relational database management system, specifically PostgreSQL, for structured data storage.
*   **Background Processing Layer:** Handles asynchronous tasks that do not require immediate user interaction. This includes operations like sending emails, processing notifications, and executing scheduled jobs. This functionality is typically managed by a background job processing system, commonly Sidekiq.

## 4. Key Components

## 5. Data Flow

The following details the data flow for several key user interactions within the Forem platform.

*   **User Authentication via Email/Password:**
    *   User enters email and password in the login form within the "User Browser".
    *   The "User Browser" sends an HTTPS POST request to the "Load Balancer".
    *   The "Load Balancer" routes the request to an available "Web Application (Rails)" instance.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" authenticates the user by comparing the provided password with the hashed password stored in the "Database (PostgreSQL)".
    *   Upon successful authentication, the "Web Application (Rails)" creates a session, storing session data (e.g., user ID) in the "Cache (Redis)" and setting a session cookie in the "User Browser".
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" redirects the "User Browser" to the authenticated area.

*   **Content Creation (Article Submission):**
    *   User navigates to the content creation page in the "User Browser".
    *   User enters the article content, title, and tags using the editor.
    *   The "User Browser" sends an HTTPS POST request to the "Load Balancer".
    *   The "Load Balancer" routes the request to a "Web Application (Rails)" instance.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" validates the submitted data.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" saves the article content, metadata, and relationships (tags, author) to the "Database (PostgreSQL)".
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" enqueues a background job in "Background Jobs (Sidekiq)" to update the "Search Index (Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL)".
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" may also enqueue a background job to send notifications to relevant users (e.g., followers).
    *   If the user uploads images, the "Web Application (Rails)" interacts with "Storage (S3/Similar)" to store the files and updates the database with the file locations.

*   **Viewing an Article:**
    *   User clicks a link to view an article in the "User Browser".
    *   The "User Browser" sends an HTTP GET request to the "Load Balancer".
    *   The "Load Balancer" routes the request to a "Web Application (Rails)" instance.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" retrieves the article content from the "Database (PostgreSQL)".
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" may retrieve related data from the "Cache (Redis)" to improve performance (e.g., user information, cached article snippets).
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" renders the HTML page and sends it back to the "User Browser".

*   **Adding a Comment to an Article:**
    *   User enters a comment in the comment form within the "User Browser".
    *   The "User Browser" sends an HTTPS POST request to the "Load Balancer".
    *   The "Load Balancer" routes the request to a "Web Application (Rails)" instance.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" validates the comment content.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" saves the comment to the "Database (PostgreSQL)", associating it with the article and the user.
    *   The "Web Application (Rails)" enqueues a background job in "Background Jobs (Sidekiq)" to send notifications to the article author and other users who have commented on the article.

## 8. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples and potential threats.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login forms, credential stuffing, session hijacking, privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigations:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), rate limiting login attempts, secure session management (using HTTPOnly and Secure cookies), robust authorization checks at the application layer.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threats:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, path traversal.
    *   **Mitigations:**  Sanitize and validate all user inputs on the server-side, use parameterized queries for database interactions, implement appropriate output encoding to prevent XSS, avoid direct execution of user-provided commands.
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   **Threats:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data, exposure of personal information.
    *   **Mitigations:**  Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., using database encryption features) and in transit (using HTTPS), implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to data, regularly audit data access logs.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Session fixation, session hijacking.
    *   **Mitigations:**  Generate strong, unpredictable session IDs, regenerate session IDs after login, set appropriate session timeout values, use secure cookies (HTTPOnly and Secure flags).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
    *   **Threats:**  Stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, use appropriate output encoding based on the context (HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL escaping).
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention:**
    *   **Threats:**  Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement CSRF tokens (e.g., using Rails' built-in functionality), use the SameSite cookie attribute.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
    *   **Mitigations:** Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions, use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Threats:** Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force attacks.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement rate limits on API endpoints, login attempts, and other critical actions.
*   **Security Headers:**
    *   **Threats:** Various browser-based attacks.
    *   **Mitigations:** Configure security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Threats:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase and infrastructure.
    *   **Mitigations:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by qualified professionals to identify and address potential weaknesses.
