        print("* **`app/helpers/content_tag_helper.rb` (or similar):** This helper is likely responsible for generating HTML tags for embedded media and iframes. Look for how URLs and attributes are handled and sanitized.")

    def _mitigation_deep_dive(self):
        print("\n### 4. Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies")

        print("\n**1. Strictly Sanitize URLs:**")
        print("* **Implementation:**  Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., `loofah` with a strict configuration) to clean URLs in `src` attributes of `<iframe>`, `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` tags.")
        print("* **Focus:** Ensure that `javascript:` URLs and other potentially malicious schemes are removed. Consider URL normalization to prevent bypasses.")

        print("\n**2. Use a Whitelist Approach for Allowed Media Sources and Iframe Attributes:**")
        print("* **Implementation:** Instead of trying to block malicious things (blacklist), explicitly define what's allowed (whitelist).")
        print("* **Media Sources:** Maintain a list of trusted domains for media embedding (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, trusted image hosts).")
        print("* **Iframe Attributes:**  Only allow a specific set of safe iframe attributes (e.g., `src`, `width`, `height`, `allowfullscreen`). Strip out any other attributes.")
        print("* **Code Example (Conceptual):**")
        print("  ```ruby")
        print("  ALLOWED_MEDIA_DOMAINS = ['www.youtube.com', 'player.vimeo.com', 'example.com']")

        print("\n**3. Implement a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP):**")
        print("* **Implementation:** Configure a robust CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load.")

        print("\n**4. Consider Using a Sandboxed Iframe Approach:**")
        print("* **Implementation:** Utilize the `sandbox` attribute for iframes to restrict the capabilities of the embedded content.")
        print("* **Restrictive Sandbox:** Apply a restrictive sandbox by default (e.g., `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"`). Carefully consider which permissions are absolutely necessary.")
        print("* **Security Benefits:** Sandboxed iframes prevent the embedded content from accessing the parent page's cookies, local storage, and other sensitive information.")

        print("    * Test various iframe attributes (including event handlers) to see if they are stripped.")
        print("    * Verify that the CSP is correctly implemented and blocking unauthorized resources.")
        print("    * Test with different browsers and browser versions.")
        print("* **Automated Testing:**")
        print("    * Integrate security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for XSS vulnerabilities.")
        print("    * Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or other SAST/DAST tools.")
        print("* **Code Reviews:**")
        print("    * Conduct thorough code reviews of the sanitization logic, URL handling, and CSP configuration.")
        print("* **Penetration Testing:**")

        print("Beyond the specific mitigation strategies, consider these broader preventive measures:")
        print("* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding principles, especially regarding input validation and output encoding.")
        print("* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities proactively.")
        print("* **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies, including sanitization libraries and the Rails framework, up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.")
        print("* **Input Validation:** Implement input validation on the frontend and backend to prevent users from submitting potentially malicious URLs or code.")
        print("* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and roles within the application.")
