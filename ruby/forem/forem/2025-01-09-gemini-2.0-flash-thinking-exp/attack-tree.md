## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in User-Generated Content [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_user-generated_content__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Scripts (XSS) via Articles, Comments, or Profiles [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage Forem's Markdown or HTML rendering capabilities to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of other users viewing the content.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Account takeover through session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Basic understanding of web technologies and XSS payloads).
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful monitoring of user-generated content and effective content security policies).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Forem's Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_forem's_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms__critical_node___high-r_28b0b553.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Bypass Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in Forem's authentication logic, such as weaknesses in password reset flows, session management, or OAuth integrations, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without proper credentials.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (Full account takeover, access to sensitive personal and community data, potential for further malicious actions).
    *   **Effort:** Medium/High (Requires in-depth understanding of authentication protocols and Forem's specific implementation).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low/Medium (Anomalous login patterns and failed login attempts can be indicators).

*   **Attack Vector: Privilege Escalation [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Forem's role-based access control (RBAC) or authorization checks to gain access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted to users with higher privileges (e.g., becoming an administrator).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Gain administrative control over the Forem instance, ability to modify critical data, manage users, and potentially compromise the underlying server).
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of Forem's permission model and identifying exploitable flaws).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Monitoring user actions and permission changes is necessary).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities within Forem [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_within_forem__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious serialized data into Forem's data streams or session management. When this data is deserialized by the application, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches).
    *   **Effort:** High (Requires deep understanding of serialization formats and potential code execution vulnerabilities).
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Difficult to detect without specific monitoring for malicious serialized data).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Forem's Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_forem's_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries (Ruby gems or other dependencies) that Forem relies upon.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Depending on the vulnerable dependency, this could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other significant compromises).
    *   **Effort:** Low (If public exploits are available) / Medium (If custom exploitation is needed).
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (If using existing exploits) / Intermediate/Expert (For custom exploitation).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low/Medium (Dependency scanning tools can identify known vulnerable dependencies).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Leverage Forem's API for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__leverage_forem's_api_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or lack of proper security measures in Forem's Application Programming Interface (API) to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data, manipulating content, or bypassing security controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Depends on the exposed API functionality – potential for data manipulation, privilege escalation, or disruption of service).
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the API endpoints and potential vulnerabilities).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Monitoring API requests for anomalous patterns and unauthorized access attempts).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Exposed Administrative Interfaces of Forem [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_exposed_administrative_interfaces_of_forem__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Forem's administrative control panel, often due to default or weak credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication, or insufficient access controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control over the Forem instance, ability to manage users, content, settings, and potentially compromise the underlying server).
    *   **Effort:** Low (If default credentials are known) / Medium (If brute-forcing or other techniques are needed).
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Failed login attempts and unusual admin activity are usually noticeable).

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Insecure File Upload Functionality within Forem [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_insecure_file_upload_functionality_within_forem__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in Forem's file upload features to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executable code) that can then be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Relatively easy to upload malicious files if validation is weak).
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of file uploads and server activity for suspicious files and execution attempts).
