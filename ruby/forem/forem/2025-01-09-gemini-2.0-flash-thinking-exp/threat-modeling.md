# Threat Model Analysis for forem/forem

## Threat: [Malicious Markdown/Liquid Injection](./threats/malicious_markdownliquid_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown or Liquid code within user-generated content (articles, comments, etc.). When this content is rendered by the Forem application, the injected code is executed by the server or the user's browser. This could involve injecting scripts, accessing server-side resources, or manipulating the rendering process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Forem server, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on users, defacement of the site, information disclosure, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/views/` (rendering engine), Markdown parsing library used by Forem, Liquid templating engine integrated within Forem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding specifically for Markdown and Liquid rendering within the Forem codebase.
        *   Utilize a secure and up-to-date Markdown parsing library within Forem.
        *   Carefully review and restrict the use of Liquid tags and filters that allow code execution within the Forem context.
        *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) configured within Forem to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly audit the Forem codebase for potential injection points in Markdown and Liquid handling.

## Threat: [Abuse of Embedded Media/Iframes for XSS](./threats/abuse_of_embedded_mediaiframes_for_xss.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker embeds malicious iframes or media (images, videos) within Forem content that contain JavaScript or redirect to attacker-controlled websites. When other users view this content through the Forem application, the malicious code executes in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to phishing sites, or other malicious activities performed in the user's context within the Forem application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/helpers/content_tag_helper.rb` (or similar helpers within Forem handling media embedding), sanitization logic for URLs and iframe attributes within the Forem codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly sanitize URLs used in embedded media and iframes within the Forem application.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed media sources and iframe attributes enforced within Forem.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) within Forem that restricts iframe sources and script execution.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed iframe approach within Forem for user-generated iframes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Authentication Integrations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_authentication_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** If the Forem instance integrates with third-party authentication providers (e.g., OAuth), vulnerabilities in the integration logic within the Forem codebase or the third-party provider itself could allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover within the Forem application, access to sensitive user data managed by Forem, and potential for further malicious actions using compromised accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication modules used by Forem (e.g., `Devise`), OAuth client libraries integrated into Forem, integration logic with third-party providers within the Forem codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and securely configure third-party authentication integrations within the Forem application.
        *   Keep authentication libraries and dependencies used by Forem up to date.
        *   Follow best practices for OAuth implementation within the Forem codebase, including proper state management and token validation.
        *   Regularly review and audit the authentication flow within the Forem application.

## Threat: [Malicious Themes or Extensions (if supported by Forem)](./threats/malicious_themes_or_extensions__if_supported_by_forem_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Forem platform allows users to install custom themes or extensions, attackers could create malicious ones that inject scripts, steal user data, or compromise the platform's functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Forem instance, data breaches affecting users of the Forem platform, and potential harm to users interacting with the malicious theme or extension.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theming engine within the Forem codebase, extension management system implemented in Forem, any APIs exposed to themes/extensions by the Forem platform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict review process for themes and extensions before they are made available on the Forem platform.
        *   Use code signing or other mechanisms within Forem to verify the authenticity and integrity of themes/extensions.
        *   Limit the capabilities of themes and extensions within the Forem framework to prevent them from performing sensitive actions.
        *   Isolate themes and extensions in sandboxed environments within the Forem application.

## Threat: [Bypass of Moderation Controls](./threats/bypass_of_moderation_controls.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent moderation features implemented within the Forem platform (e.g., content filtering, user banning) to post inappropriate content, evade bans, or continue malicious activities.
    *   **Impact:** Allows malicious actors to continue their attacks on the Forem platform, spread harmful content to Forem users, and damage the community hosted on Forem.
    *   **Affected Component:** Moderation modules within the Forem codebase, content filtering mechanisms implemented in Forem, user banning system managed by Forem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and multi-layered moderation controls within the Forem application.
        *   Regularly review and update moderation rules and filters within the Forem platform.
        *   Provide clear reporting mechanisms for users to flag inappropriate content within Forem.
        *   Consider using a combination of automated and human moderation within the Forem environment.
        *   Log moderation actions within Forem for auditing purposes.

## Threat: [Information Leakage via APIs or Data Exports](./threats/information_leakage_via_apis_or_data_exports.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Forem's APIs or data export features could allow unauthorized access to user data, system configurations, or other sensitive information managed by the Forem platform.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violations affecting Forem users, exposure of sensitive data managed by Forem, and potential regulatory consequences for the Forem instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** API endpoints defined within the Forem codebase, data export modules implemented by Forem, authentication and authorization logic for APIs and data exports within the Forem application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all API endpoints and data export features within the Forem application.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize input to API endpoints exposed by Forem.
        *   Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for API communication within the Forem platform.
        *   Log API access and data export activities within Forem for auditing.
        *   Implement rate limiting for API requests to the Forem instance.
