### Security Implications of Key Components:

**Presentation Layer:**

*   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if user-generated content is not properly sanitized before rendering. Reliance on client-side JavaScript for certain functionalities could introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side output encoding based on context (HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL escaping) to prevent XSS.
    *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating XSS and data injection attacks.
    *   Carefully review and audit any client-side JavaScript code for potential vulnerabilities. Avoid inline JavaScript where possible.
    *   Consider using a JavaScript framework with built-in security features and follow its security best practices.

**Application Layer (Ruby on Rails):**

*   **Security Implication:**  Potential for vulnerabilities common in Rails applications, such as Mass Assignment vulnerabilities if not using strong parameter whitelisting, SQL Injection if raw SQL queries are used without proper sanitization, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) if not adequately protected.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly use strong parameters to whitelist allowed attributes for model updates, preventing Mass Assignment vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize ActiveRecord's query interface for database interactions, which automatically escapes values and prevents SQL Injection. Avoid raw SQL queries.
    *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled globally in the Rails application and that authenticity tokens are included in all state-changing forms.
    *   Regularly update the Rails framework and its dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security linters and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities during development.

**Data Layer (PostgreSQL):**

*   **Security Implication:**  Risk of SQL Injection if the application layer does not properly sanitize inputs before constructing database queries. Unauthorized access to the database if proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are not in place. Data breaches if the database is not securely configured and managed.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   As mentioned above, consistently use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord's query interface to prevent SQL Injection.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for database users and restrict database access based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest using PostgreSQL's encryption features.
    *   Regularly back up the database and store backups securely.
