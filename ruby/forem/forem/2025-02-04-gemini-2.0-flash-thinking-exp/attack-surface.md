# Attack Surface Analysis for forem/forem

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from the processing and rendering of user-supplied Markdown content. If not properly sanitized by Forem, malicious JavaScript code can be injected and executed in users' browsers when they view the content.
*   **Forem Contribution:** Forem's core functionality heavily relies on Markdown for user-generated content like articles, comments, and forum posts. This makes robust Markdown sanitization a critical security requirement for Forem.  Any weakness in Forem's Markdown handling directly translates to a significant XSS risk.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a Markdown article containing `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` and publishes it. When another user views the article on the Forem platform, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users, or deface the page within the Forem site.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover of Forem users, data theft (cookies, session tokens, potentially personal information displayed on the Forem platform), website defacement within the Forem instance, redirection to malicious sites impacting Forem users, malware distribution targeting Forem users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Forem Core & Instance Admins):**
        *   **Utilize and rigorously maintain a robust Markdown parsing and sanitization library within Forem.**  Ensure the library is configured to aggressively strip out potentially dangerous HTML tags, JavaScript event handlers, and malicious URL schemes. Regularly update the library as part of Forem updates to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement and enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers at the Forem application level.** CSP should be configured to strictly limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks within Forem.
        *   **Conduct thorough and frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Markdown rendering within Forem.**  Employ both automated and manual testing techniques to identify and remediate any XSS vulnerabilities in Forem's Markdown handling.
        *   **Educate Forem users (especially content creators and moderators) about the risks of XSS and best practices for creating secure content.** While primary mitigation is on the platform side, user awareness can help reduce accidental introduction of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload and File Inclusion](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_and_file_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to Forem allowing users to upload files without proper validation and security measures. This can lead to attackers uploading malicious files (web shells, malware) directly to the Forem server or exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities to access or execute arbitrary files within the Forem instance.
*   **Forem Contribution:** Forem's features for user profiles, article attachments, and potentially custom themes or plugins can involve file upload functionalities.  If Forem's file upload handling is not meticulously secured, it becomes a direct and high-risk attack vector against the Forem platform.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Malicious Web Shell Upload:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a profile picture through Forem's profile update feature. If Forem's backend doesn't properly validate file types and allows execution of PHP files in the upload directory (due to server misconfiguration or Forem's handling), the attacker can gain remote code execution on the Forem server via the web shell.
    *   **File Inclusion via Theme Upload:** If Forem allows theme uploads and doesn't properly sanitize or isolate uploaded themes, an attacker could upload a malicious theme containing code that exploits file inclusion vulnerabilities to access sensitive configuration files or application code of the Forem instance.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Forem server, full server compromise, data breach of the Forem instance and its database, website defacement of the Forem platform, malware distribution to users downloading files from the compromised Forem instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Forem Core & Instance Admins):**
        *   **Implement extremely strict file type validation within Forem's file upload handlers.**  Only allow a very limited whitelist of truly necessary file types and rigorously reject all others. Validate file types based on file content (magic numbers) and not just easily spoofed file extensions.
        *   **Sanitize filenames rigorously within Forem.**  Remove or replace *all* potentially dangerous characters from filenames during upload processing to prevent path traversal and other filename-based exploits.
        *   **Store all user-uploaded files *outside* of the web root of the Forem instance.**  Prevent any possibility of direct web access to uploaded files. Serve files only through Forem's application code, with robust access control checks performed *before* serving any file.
        *   **Implement and enforce strict file size limits within Forem's upload handlers.**  Prevent excessively large file uploads that could lead to denial-of-service or storage exhaustion attacks against the Forem server.
        *   **Consider utilizing a dedicated, isolated storage service (e.g., cloud object storage) for user uploads within Forem.** This can provide an additional layer of security and isolation, offloading some security responsibilities and reducing the attack surface of the main Forem server.
        *   **Implement regular malware scanning of all uploaded files within Forem.** Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning services to automatically detect and quarantine malicious files uploaded by users.

## Attack Surface: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Vulnerabilities leading to Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/role-based_access_control__rbac__vulnerabilities_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in the implementation or configuration of Forem's role-based access control system.  If Forem's RBAC is not correctly implemented or has vulnerabilities, it can lead to privilege escalation, where regular users gain unauthorized access to administrative or moderator functionalities within the Forem platform.
*   **Forem Contribution:** Forem's security model is fundamentally based on RBAC, managing permissions for different user roles (admin, moderator, user, etc.).  Vulnerabilities specifically within Forem's RBAC logic are direct and critical attack surfaces.  Weaknesses in Forem's role management directly undermine the platform's security.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Role Assignment Bypass in Forem Code:** A coding error within Forem's role assignment logic allows a regular user to manipulate API requests or exploit a vulnerability in the user interface to directly grant themselves administrator privileges within the Forem instance.
    *   **Insufficient Permission Checks in Forem Features:**  Forem's code lacks proper authorization checks in certain features, allowing users without the necessary roles to access admin-only endpoints, perform moderator actions (e.g., content deletion, user banning), or modify sensitive settings within the Forem platform.
    *   **Default Role Over-Permissiveness in Forem Configuration:** Default role configurations within Forem are overly broad, unintentionally granting regular users more administrative or moderator-like permissions than intended, leading to potential abuse and security breaches.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation to administrator level within Forem, unauthorized access to all administrative functions of the Forem platform, complete control over the Forem instance, data manipulation and deletion, system compromise, website defacement of the Forem platform, potential for further attacks on the underlying server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Forem Core & Instance Admins):**
        *   **Implement extremely robust and thoroughly tested RBAC logic within Forem.**  Ensure that role assignments and permission checks are correctly and consistently implemented and rigorously enforced throughout *all* parts of the Forem application code.
        *   **Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege in Forem's RBAC design.**  Grant each user role within Forem *only* the absolute minimum necessary permissions required for their intended functions. Avoid overly broad or permissive default roles.
        *   **Conduct regular and comprehensive security audits and code reviews specifically focused on Forem's RBAC implementation.**  Actively search for and remediate any potential weaknesses, inconsistencies, or vulnerabilities in the access control system.
        *   **Implement extensive automated tests specifically for Forem's RBAC.**  Write unit and integration tests to rigorously verify that permission checks are working as designed and to prevent regressions during code updates and modifications to Forem.
        *   **Securely manage role definitions and user role assignments within Forem.**  Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of role definitions and user assignments, ensuring that only authorized administrators can manage user permissions.
        *   **Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within the Forem instance.**  Actively monitor user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and revoke any unnecessary or excessive permissions.
