* **Why Critical:** Application vulnerabilities are often direct paths to system compromise and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Authentication & Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__authentication_&_authorization_bypass__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Circumventing security mechanisms designed to verify user identity and permissions.
* **Why Critical:** Successful bypass grants unauthorized access, potentially leading to privilege escalation and full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Exploit Weak Password Policies/Defaults (Forem Default Settings) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__exploit_weak_password_policiesdefaults__forem_default_settings___critical_node___high-risk_pa_88e8ab5c.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * Attackers attempt to use default credentials (if not changed) or brute-force weak passwords for administrator or privileged accounts.
* **Impact:** Gaining administrator access grants full control over the Forem application, including data, configuration, and user management.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
    * Immediately change all default credentials upon deployment.
    * Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrator and privileged accounts.
    * Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Input Validation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__input_validation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

    * Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content (articles, comments, profiles) that is then executed in other users' browsers when they view the content.
* **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, phishing attacks targeting users of the Forem application.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement robust output encoding/escaping of all user-generated content before rendering it in web pages.
    * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    * Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities and conduct code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.4. Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL, Command, etc.) (Forem Database Interactions, External Integrations) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_4__injection_vulnerabilities__sql__command__etc____forem_database_interactions__external_integra_7cc10e7e.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., SQL queries, system commands) into input fields or through integrations, which is then executed by the Forem application's backend systems.
* **Impact:** Database compromise (data breach, data manipulation, data deletion), remote code execution on the server, system takeover.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
    * Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in database queries or system commands.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege for database access, granting only necessary permissions to the application user.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.5. File Upload Vulnerabilities (Avatar Uploads, Media Attachments) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_5__file_upload_vulnerabilities__avatar_uploads__media_attachments___critical_node___high-risk_pa_de59d2da.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware, executable files) through file upload features (avatars, media attachments). If not properly handled, these files can be executed on the server or used to compromise user devices.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server (if web shell is uploaded and accessed), malware distribution to users who download the files, system compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement strict file type validation (allowlist approach).
    * Enforce file size limits.
    * Sanitize uploaded filenames.
    * Store uploaded files outside of the web root to prevent direct execution.
    * Implement virus scanning of uploaded files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Outdated Gems, Libraries used by Forem) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__dependency_vulnerabilities__outdated_gems__libraries_used_by_forem___critical_node___high-risk__d754c3ec.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated third-party libraries (gems, libraries) used by Forem. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Regularly update Forem and all its dependencies to the latest versions, including security patches.
    * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    * Monitor security advisories for Forem and its dependencies to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Misconfigured Database Server (e.g., Weak credentials, exposed ports) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] (If applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__misconfigured_database_server__e_g___weak_credentials__exposed_ports___critical_node___high-ris_b8be5243.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * Attackers compromise the repositories or distribution channels of Forem's dependencies (e.g., RubyGems), injecting malicious code into seemingly legitimate libraries. When Forem developers install or update these compromised dependencies, the malicious code is incorporated into their application.
* **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the affected dependencies, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, and backdoors.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Use reputable and trusted sources for Forem and its dependencies.
    * Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or digital signatures.
    * Implement dependency scanning and monitoring tools to detect unexpected changes or malicious code in dependencies.
    * Consider using dependency pinning or vendoring to control dependency versions and reduce the risk of supply chain attacks.
