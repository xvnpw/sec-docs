## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of the Application (Root Goal) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_and_control_of_the_application__root_goal___critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success here means the attacker has compromised the application and can perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Forem Features Directly (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_forem_features_directly__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging inherent functionalities within Forem to achieve compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Content Injection Attacks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/content_injection_attacks__critical_node_.md)

This category involves injecting malicious content into the application through Forem's features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content (OR) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content__or___high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious JavaScript in Articles/Posts:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Forem's Markdown or Liquid parsing to inject malicious JavaScript code into articles or posts. When other users view this content, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover, or redirection to malicious sites.
        * **Leverage Forem's Markdown/Liquid parsing vulnerabilities:** This specific attack vector targets weaknesses in how Forem processes and renders Markdown or Liquid code, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Liquid (OR) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_liquid__or___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject malicious Liquid code in user-controlled areas (e.g., custom themes, potentially articles if not properly sandboxed):** Attackers inject malicious Liquid code into areas where users can input or customize content, such as custom themes or potentially articles if input sanitization is insufficient. When the server renders these templates, the malicious Liquid code is executed server-side, potentially leading to remote code execution and complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation within Forem (OR) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation_within_forem__or___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Role Management:** Attackers identify and exploit flaws in Forem's code that manages user roles and permissions.
        * **Bypass checks to assign higher privileges to malicious accounts:** This specific attack vector involves circumventing the intended authorization mechanisms to grant a lower-privileged account higher privileges, potentially leading to administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Forem's Infrastructure and Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_forem's_infrastructure_and_dependencies__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure and third-party libraries used by Forem.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Forem's Dependencies (OR) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_forem's_dependencies__or___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit known vulnerabilities in Ruby gems used by Forem:** Forem relies on various Ruby gems (libraries). Attackers can identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
        * **Leverage tools like `bundler-audit` to identify and exploit outdated dependencies:** This specific attack vector involves using tools like `bundler-audit` to find outdated and vulnerable gems and then exploiting those vulnerabilities, often leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of Forem's Environment (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_forem's_environment__or_.md)

This category involves exploiting improper configuration settings in the Forem deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed API Keys or Secrets (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_api_keys_or_secrets__critical_node_.md)

**Gain access to sensitive credentials stored in Forem's configuration:** Attackers discover and gain access to sensitive API keys, database credentials, or other secrets that are improperly stored or exposed in Forem's configuration files or environment variables. This can grant them unauthorized access to external services or the application's database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Forem's API (OR) (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_forem's_api__or___high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on attacking the application through its API endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit flaws in Forem's API authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT vulnerabilities):** Attackers identify and exploit weaknesses in how Forem authenticates API requests. This could involve vulnerabilities in the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or other authentication methods, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access API endpoints without proper credentials.
