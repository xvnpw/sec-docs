# Threat Model Analysis for forem/forem

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious article or comment using Markdown features that are not properly sanitized by Forem. This involves injecting JavaScript code that executes within the Forem application in the browsers of other users viewing the content.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could steal session cookies, redirect users within the Forem application to malicious content, deface pages within the Forem application, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the Forem application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/lib/markdown_processor.rb` (or similar module responsible for rendering Markdown content within Forem), potentially browser rendering of the output generated by Forem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Forem's Markdown rendering library is up-to-date and patched against known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) within the Forem application to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Sanitize Markdown output on the server-side within the Forem application before rendering it to the client.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_malicious_markdown.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts Markdown content that leverages Forem's features (e.g., embedding external content via links or specific Markdown extensions handled by Forem) to make the Forem server initiate requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs. This directly uses Forem's functionality to perform the attack.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could scan internal networks accessible to the Forem server, access internal services not exposed to the internet through the Forem server, or potentially use the Forem server as a proxy to attack other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/lib/markdown_processor.rb` within Forem, potentially image handling or link processing logic implemented within Forem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs provided in Markdown content processed by Forem.
        *   Implement restrictions within the Forem application on the types of URLs the server is allowed to access.
        *   Use a network firewall to restrict outbound traffic from the Forem server.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Image Upload](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_image_upload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in Forem's image processing libraries (e.g., during thumbnail generation or resizing performed by Forem). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Forem server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Forem server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data managed by Forem, modify files within the Forem installation, or disrupt the Forem service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Image upload handlers within Forem (likely in controllers), image processing libraries (e.g., `MiniMagick`, `ImageProcessing`) used by Forem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Forem's dependencies, especially image processing libraries, up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Validate image headers and content within Forem before processing.
        *   Consider running image processing in a sandboxed environment within the Forem deployment.

## Threat: [Account Takeover via OAuth Flaws](./threats/account_takeover_via_oauth_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Forem's integration with OAuth providers (e.g., improper redirect URI validation, state parameter manipulation within Forem's OAuth implementation) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts within the Forem application.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can access and control the victim's Forem account, potentially posting malicious content within Forem, accessing private information within Forem, or performing other actions as the user within the Forem application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication modules within Forem, OAuth integration logic (likely in controllers and models related to user authentication within Forem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate redirect URIs during the OAuth flow within Forem.
        *   Properly implement and verify the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks during OAuth within Forem.
        *   Regularly review and update the OAuth client libraries used by Forem.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Admin Panel Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_admin_panel_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities within Forem's administrative interface that allow them to gain unauthorized administrative privileges within the Forem application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Forem instance, including the ability to modify site settings within Forem, manage users within Forem, and potentially access sensitive data or the underlying server hosting Forem.
    *   **Affected Component:** Administrative interface components within Forem (controllers, views, authentication and authorization logic specific to the admin panel within Forem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the admin panel within Forem.
        *   Regularly audit the admin panel code within Forem for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict access to the admin panel to authorized personnel only.
