# Attack Surface Analysis for forem/forem

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Forem's use of a Markdown rendering library to display user-generated content (articles, comments, etc.) can be exploited if the library has vulnerabilities. Maliciously crafted Markdown can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting JavaScript into rendered pages, or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the rendering process allows embedding external resources without proper sanitization.
- **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's core functionality relies on displaying user-generated content formatted with Markdown. The specific implementation and version of the chosen Markdown rendering library directly determine the susceptibility to these vulnerabilities.
- **Example:** A user crafts a comment containing Markdown that, when rendered by Forem, executes JavaScript to steal session cookies and send them to an attacker's server.
- **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of content, redirection to malicious sites.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Use a well-maintained and actively patched Markdown rendering library.
        - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        - Sanitize and validate user-provided Markdown input on the server-side before rendering.
        - Regularly update the Markdown rendering library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        - Consider using a sandboxed rendering environment if the risk is very high.

## Attack Surface: [Liquid Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/liquid_templating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** If Forem utilizes the Liquid templating engine for theming or dynamic content generation, vulnerabilities in the Liquid implementation can allow attackers to inject malicious code that executes directly on the Forem server (Server-Side Template Injection - SSTI). This can lead to complete server compromise.
- **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's theming system or features that dynamically generate content based on user input or application state might rely on Liquid. Improperly secured Liquid templates become a direct entry point for attackers.
- **Example:** An attacker injects malicious Liquid code into a profile description field that, when processed by Forem's templating engine, allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the Forem server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, information disclosure.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Ensure the Liquid templating engine is properly configured and sandboxed to prevent access to sensitive server-side objects and functions.
        - Carefully review and sanitize any user-provided input that is used within Liquid templates.
        - Avoid allowing users to directly modify or upload Liquid templates unless absolutely necessary and with strict security controls.
        - Keep the Liquid templating engine updated to the latest version.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

- **Description:** Forem's functionality allowing users to upload files (avatars, attachments, etc.) becomes a critical vulnerability if file type restrictions and security measures are insufficient. Attackers can upload malicious scripts that can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
- **How Forem Contributes:** The file upload feature is a direct component of Forem, enabling user interaction and content creation. The security of this feature is entirely dependent on Forem's implementation.
- **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through Forem's avatar upload feature. If the server is configured to execute PHP in the upload directory, this script can be accessed and executed, granting the attacker control over the server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, serving malware to other users, storage exhaustion.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        - Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
        - Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        - Use a dedicated storage service with security features.
        - Implement file size limits.
        - Consider using antivirus scanning on uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Key Management for Integrations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_key_management_for_integrations.md)

- **Description:** When Forem integrates with external services, the security of the stored API keys is paramount. If Forem stores these keys insecurely, attackers gaining access to the Forem system can steal these keys and compromise the integrated services, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
- **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's integration capabilities necessitate the storage and use of API keys for external services. The method Forem employs for storing and managing these keys directly impacts the security of these integrations.
- **Example:** An attacker gains access to Forem's database (due to a separate vulnerability) and retrieves API keys for a connected email service. They can then use these keys to send phishing emails to Forem users or access sensitive data within the email service.
- **Impact:** Data breaches on integrated services, unauthorized actions on behalf of users, reputational damage.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        - Avoid hardcoding API keys in the codebase.
        - Implement proper access controls to restrict who can access API keys.
        - Regularly rotate API keys.
        - Use encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in APIs](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_apis.md)

- **Description:** Forem's REST or GraphQL APIs might have endpoints that allow updating resource attributes. If these endpoints don't properly filter user input, attackers can manipulate request parameters to modify fields they shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption.
- **How Forem Contributes:** Forem's API design and implementation directly control which fields are exposed for modification and how input is validated. Lack of proper input filtering in Forem's API code creates this vulnerability.
- **Example:** An attacker sends a request to Forem's user profile update API, including a parameter to change their user role to "administrator," and the API doesn't prevent this unauthorized modification.
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data modification, unauthorized access to features.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Explicitly define which fields are allowed to be updated for each API endpoint.
        - Use allow-lists (whitelists) instead of block-lists (blacklists) for allowed fields.
        - Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only modify their own data or data they are authorized to manage.
        - Avoid directly mapping request parameters to database fields without validation.
