Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Postal:

*   **Threat:** Sender Authentication Bypass (SPF/DKIM/DMARC Misconfiguration)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send emails that appear to originate from our domain by exploiting misconfigurations in Postal's SPF, DKIM, or DMARC settings. They might forge the `From` address to impersonate legitimate senders within our organization.
    *   **Impact:**  Damaged sender reputation, successful phishing attacks targeting our users or external parties, potential financial loss or data breaches due to successful phishing.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  SMTP Outbound Handler, DNS Configuration (external to Postal but crucial for its function).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly configure SPF records to list authorized sending IP addresses.
        *   Implement DKIM signing for outgoing emails using a strong private key and publish the corresponding public key in DNS.
        *   Configure DMARC policy to instruct receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that fail SPF and DKIM checks.
        *   Regularly monitor SPF, DKIM, and DMARC reports to identify potential issues or abuse.

*   **Threat:** Email Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate input fields or exploit vulnerabilities in Postal's email composition logic to inject arbitrary headers into emails sent via Postal. This could be used to bypass spam filters, redirect replies, or inject malicious content.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful phishing attacks, malware distribution, manipulation of email routing, damage to sender reputation.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  SMTP Inbound Handler (receiving from our application), Email Composition Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all email input provided by users or our application before sending it to Postal.
        *   Use Postal's API or libraries in a way that prevents direct header manipulation.
        *   Implement proper output encoding to prevent interpretation of injected code.

*   **Threat:** Storage Vulnerabilities Leading to Data Breach
    *   **Description:**  If the underlying storage mechanism used by Postal (e.g., database, file system) has vulnerabilities, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to stored emails, logs, or configuration data. This could involve SQL injection, file traversal, or other storage-specific exploits within Postal's storage layer.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive email content, user data, application secrets, or Postal configuration.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  Database Interface, Message Storage Module, Log Storage Module.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the database or file system used by Postal is properly secured and patched against known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong access controls to the storage layer.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the storage.
        *   Regularly back up Postal data to facilitate recovery in case of a breach.

*   **Threat:** Transit Encryption Weaknesses (TLS Misconfiguration)

    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive email content during transmission.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  SMTP Client (outbound), SMTP Server (inbound), TLS Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Postal is configured to use the latest secure TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable support for weak or obsolete cipher suites within Postal's configuration.
        *   Regularly update Postal and its dependencies to patch any known TLS vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce TLS for both inbound and outbound connections within Postal's settings.

*   **Threat:** Web Interface Vulnerabilities (if enabled)
    *   **Description:** If Postal's web interface is enabled for administration or other purposes, vulnerabilities in this interface (e.g., XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass) could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Postal server and its data.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Postal server, access to stored emails and configuration, ability to send unauthorized emails.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  Web Interface, Authentication Module, Authorization Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Postal web interface updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the web interface.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all web interface traffic.
        *   Consider disabling the web interface if it's not strictly necessary.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.

*   **Threat:** Email Bombing and Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Postal's rate limiting or queue management to flood the server with a large volume of emails, causing a denial of service for legitimate email traffic handled by Postal.
    *   **Impact:**  Inability to send or receive emails, performance degradation, potential system instability of the Postal server.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:**  SMTP Inbound Handler, Queue Management Module, Rate Limiting Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate rate limits for incoming and outgoing emails within Postal.
        *   Implement connection limits to prevent excessive connections from single sources within Postal's configuration.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity on the Postal server.
        *   Consider using a dedicated mail server with sufficient resources to handle potential spikes in traffic.
