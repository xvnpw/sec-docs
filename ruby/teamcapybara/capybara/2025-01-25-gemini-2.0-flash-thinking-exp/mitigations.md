# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Sensitive Data in Capybara Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_sensitive_data_in_capybara_interactions.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine what data is considered sensitive within your application and could be exposed through Capybara interactions (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII).
2.  **Implement Sanitization Functions:** Create reusable functions or helper methods within your test suite to mask or redact sensitive data before it is logged or included in test reports. These functions can use regular expressions or keyword lists to identify and sanitize sensitive information.
3.  **Apply Sanitization in Test Code:**  Within your Capybara tests, whenever you interact with elements that might contain sensitive data (e.g., input fields, displayed text), use the sanitization functions *before* logging or reporting the interaction. For example, instead of directly logging `page.find('#password').value`, use `sanitize_log_data(page.find('#password').value)`.
4.  **Customize Capybara Logging (Optional):** If feasible, explore customizing Capybara's logging mechanisms to automatically apply sanitization to log messages before they are written. This might involve overriding or extending Capybara's logging components if the framework allows for such customization.
5.  **Regularly Review Sanitization Rules:** Periodically review and update your sanitization rules and functions to ensure they remain effective as your application and data handling practices evolve.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Data Exposure in Test Logs and Reports (High Severity):** Unintentional logging or inclusion of sensitive data in test outputs generated by Capybara, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access. This is high severity because sensitive data leaks can lead to serious security breaches.
### Impact:
*   **Data Exposure in Test Logs and Reports (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leaks in test outputs by actively masking or removing sensitive information from Capybara interactions before they are logged or reported.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Partially Implemented:** Basic sanitization functions for passwords exist in `test/support/helpers.rb`.
### Missing Implementation:
*   Automated sanitization within Capybara's core logging is not implemented.
*   Consistent application of sanitization across all tests, especially newly written ones, is lacking.
*   Regular review and updates of sanitization rules are not formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Capybara Configuration for Security Implications](./mitigation_strategies/review_capybara_configuration_for_security_implications.md)

### Description:
1.  **Configuration Audit:** Conduct a security-focused audit of your Capybara configuration files (e.g., `spec_helper.rb`, `rails_helper.rb`, or similar setup files).
2.  **Logging Level Review:** Examine Capybara's logging level configuration. Ensure it is set appropriately for different environments. Avoid overly verbose logging in production-like test environments that might inadvertently capture sensitive data.
3.  **Screenshot Configuration:** Review settings related to screenshot capture. Ensure screenshots are stored securely and do not unintentionally capture sensitive information displayed on the screen during tests. Consider disabling or restricting screenshot capture in sensitive environments.
4.  **Driver Configuration Security:**  If using drivers like Selenium or Webdriver, review their specific configurations for any security implications. Ensure the driver is configured securely and does not introduce unnecessary vulnerabilities. For example, check for secure communication protocols and access controls for the driver server.
5.  **Data Persistence Review:** If your Capybara setup involves any data persistence or caching mechanisms, review these configurations to ensure sensitive data is not being stored insecurely or for excessive periods.
6.  **Consult Security Best Practices:** Refer to Capybara's documentation and community resources for security best practices and recommended configurations to avoid common security pitfalls related to Capybara setup.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Misconfiguration of Capybara (Medium Severity):** Insecure or default Capybara configurations leading to unintended data exposure, excessive logging of sensitive information, or other security weaknesses within the testing process itself. While not directly application-breaking, misconfiguration can weaken security posture and increase risk of data leaks.
### Impact:
*   **Misconfiguration of Capybara (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities arising from insecure Capybara configurations by proactively reviewing and hardening configuration settings based on security best practices.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Partially Implemented:** Basic Capybara configuration is set up for test execution.
### Missing Implementation:
*   No formal security review process specifically for Capybara configuration has been established.
*   Specific security guidelines for Capybara configuration are not documented or actively followed.
*   Logging level, screenshot capture, and driver configurations have not been explicitly reviewed from a security perspective.
