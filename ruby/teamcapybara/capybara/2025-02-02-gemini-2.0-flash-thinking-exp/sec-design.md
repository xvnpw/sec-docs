# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: To provide a flexible and reliable tool for automated web application testing.
  - Goal: To enable developers and testers to write effective and maintainable integration and acceptance tests.
  - Goal: To improve software quality and reduce bugs in web applications by facilitating comprehensive testing.
  - Priority: Ease of use and developer productivity are high priorities to encourage adoption and effective testing practices.
  - Priority: Compatibility with various web browsers and testing frameworks is important to cater to a wide range of projects.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in Capybara itself could be exploited to compromise testing environments or applications under test.
  - Risk: Improper use of Capybara in test scripts could inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities in the applications being tested (e.g., exposing sensitive data in logs).
  - Risk: Lack of maintenance and updates could lead to incompatibility with newer browsers or security issues remaining unpatched.
  - Risk: Dependency on third-party libraries (like browser drivers) introduces supply chain risks if those dependencies are compromised.
  - Risk: If used in production-like environments for monitoring, misconfigurations could lead to unintended actions or data exposure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub - provides version control and transparency. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Open Source project - community review and scrutiny can help identify potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: Open Source nature of the project.
  - security control: Issue tracking on GitHub - allows reporting and tracking of bugs and potential security issues. Implemented: GitHub Issues.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes - response time and quality of fixes may vary.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - Capybara relies on external libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Perform regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external sources.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization within Capybara's core logic to prevent potential injection attacks if test scripts are crafted maliciously.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Capybara itself does not require authentication as it is a library used within testing code. However, test scripts using Capybara might need to handle authentication to access applications under test.
    - Requirement: Securely manage credentials used in test scripts for authentication. Avoid hardcoding credentials in scripts; use environment variables or secure vault mechanisms.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Capybara's authorization is implicitly managed by the test scripts and the permissions of the user running the tests.
    - Requirement: Ensure test environments and applications under test have appropriate authorization controls to prevent unauthorized access or actions during testing.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Capybara should handle user-provided inputs in test scripts safely to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Test scripts should validate inputs to the applications under test to ensure data integrity and security.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Capybara itself might not directly implement cryptography. However, if test scripts handle sensitive data or interact with secure endpoints (HTTPS), ensure proper handling of encryption and secure communication.
    - Requirement: If Capybara stores any temporary data (e.g., session information), consider encrypting sensitive data at rest or in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Business Process: Software Development and Quality Assurance.
  - Description: Capybara supports the critical process of ensuring software quality through automated testing, which is essential for delivering reliable and functional web applications.
  - Protection Goal: Maintain the integrity and reliability of the software development and release pipeline. Prevent introduction of vulnerabilities through compromised testing tools or processes.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data Type: Test Scripts.
  - Sensitivity: Medium. Test scripts may contain business logic, application workflows, and potentially sensitive data like API endpoints or data structures. Exposure could reveal application functionality or weaknesses.
  - Protection Goal: Maintain confidentiality and integrity of test scripts.
  - Data Type: Application Data accessed during tests.
  - Sensitivity: High to Low (depending on application). Capybara interacts with the application under test, potentially accessing and manipulating sensitive user data, financial information, or personal details.
  - Protection Goal: Prevent unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure of application data during testing. Ensure secure handling of credentials and sensitive data within test environments and scripts.
  - Data Type: Build Artifacts (gem package).
  - Sensitivity: Medium. Compromised build artifacts could lead to distribution of vulnerable or malicious versions of Capybara.
  - Protection Goal: Maintain integrity and authenticity of build artifacts. Ensure secure distribution channels.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Question: What is the intended deployment environment for Capybara in the user's context? (Local development, CI/CD, dedicated test environment, production monitoring?)
  - Question: What level of security maturity does the user's organization have? (Startup, Fortune 500, etc.) This will influence the risk appetite and feasibility of implementing certain security controls.
  - Question: Are there specific compliance requirements that need to be considered (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) when using Capybara for testing applications that handle sensitive data?
  - Question: What types of web applications will be tested using Capybara? (Public facing websites, internal applications, applications handling highly sensitive data?)

- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: Capybara is primarily used for functional and integration testing of web applications, not for security testing in the sense of penetration testing or vulnerability scanning of Capybara itself.
  - Assumption: The user is concerned with the security of their software development lifecycle and wants to ensure that Capybara is used and built in a secure manner.
  - Assumption: The organization using Capybara has a general need to improve their security posture and is looking for practical and actionable recommendations.
  - Assumption: The deployment scenario described in detail (Local Development Environment) is a common and relevant use case for Capybara.
  - Assumption: GitHub Actions is used as a representative CI/CD system for illustrating the build process, but other CI/CD systems could be used as well.
