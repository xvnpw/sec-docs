# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Mitigation Strategy: [Anonymize or Redact Sensitive Data in Capybara Test Scenarios](./mitigation_strategies/anonymize_or_redact_sensitive_data_in_capybara_test_scenarios.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Anonymize or Redact Sensitive Data in Capybara Test Scenarios
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Sensitive Data in Capybara Interactions:** Developers should pinpoint where Capybara tests interact with sensitive data. This includes:
        *   Data entered into forms using Capybara's `fill_in` or similar methods.
        *   Data used in Capybara assertions that might reveal sensitive information in page content or attributes.
        *   Data used to seed test databases or mock external services accessed during Capybara tests.
    *   **Step 2: Replace Real Data in Capybara Steps:** Modify Capybara test steps to use anonymized or synthetic data instead of real sensitive data. This involves:
        *   Using Faker libraries within Capybara tests to generate fake data for form inputs. Example: `fill_in 'Email', with: Faker::Internet.email`
        *   Creating helper methods or data factories to provide anonymized data for use in Capybara tests.
        *   Ensuring Capybara assertions are designed to verify functionality without relying on displaying or logging real sensitive data.
    *   **Step 3: Review Capybara Tests for Data Exposure:** Regularly review Capybara test code to ensure no real sensitive data is being used in test scenarios or inadvertently exposed through Capybara's actions or outputs (like screenshots or page dumps).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data through Capybara Test Code (High Severity):** Real sensitive data used directly in Capybara tests can be accidentally committed to version control, exposed in CI/CD pipelines, or leaked through test reports generated by Capybara.
    *   **Data Breach if Test Artifacts from Capybara are Compromised (Medium Severity):** If test artifacts generated by Capybara (like screenshots or HTML dumps) are stored insecurely and compromised, they could contain sensitive data if real data is used in tests.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk for both threats. By ensuring Capybara tests operate solely on anonymized data, the potential for sensitive data exposure through test code and artifacts is drastically minimized.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Usernames and passwords for test accounts used in Capybara tests are generally anonymized using Faker in test setup files.
    *   However, the anonymization of data used in form inputs and assertions within individual Capybara feature tests might be inconsistent and require more systematic application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a project-wide standard for anonymizing data in all Capybara tests, particularly focusing on form interactions and assertions.
    *   Develop reusable helper methods or data factories specifically for generating anonymized data for Capybara tests.
    *   Implement code review checklists to specifically verify the anonymization of sensitive data in Capybara test code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Update Capybara and Driver Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_update_capybara_and_driver_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Review and Update Capybara and Driver Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Track Capybara and Driver Dependencies:** Maintain a clear inventory of Capybara and its associated driver dependencies (e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Rack::Test, Capybara Webkit, etc.) used in the project.
    *   **Step 2: Monitor for Security Vulnerabilities:** Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub Security Advisories) for reported vulnerabilities in Capybara and its dependencies.
    *   **Step 3: Update Capybara and Drivers Promptly:** When security updates or patches are released for Capybara or its drivers, prioritize updating to the latest versions as quickly as possible.
    *   **Step 4: Test After Updates:** After updating Capybara or drivers, thoroughly run your Capybara test suite to ensure compatibility and identify any regressions introduced by the updates.
    *   **Step 5: Automate Dependency Updates:** Consider using dependency management tools and automation to streamline the process of checking for and updating Capybara and driver dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Capybara or Drivers (High Severity):** Outdated versions of Capybara or its drivers may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit if they gain access to the test environment or can influence test execution. This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduces risk. Regularly updating Capybara and drivers mitigates the risk of exploitation of *known* vulnerabilities. However, it does not protect against zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Dependency management tools (like Bundler for Ruby projects) are used to manage Capybara and driver dependencies.
    *   However, proactive monitoring for security vulnerabilities and a formalized process for timely updates might be lacking. Updates are often performed reactively rather than proactively.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning for Capybara and its drivers as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Establish a process for regularly reviewing dependency updates and prioritizing security patches for Capybara and drivers.
    *   Document a clear procedure for updating Capybara and drivers, including testing and rollback steps.
