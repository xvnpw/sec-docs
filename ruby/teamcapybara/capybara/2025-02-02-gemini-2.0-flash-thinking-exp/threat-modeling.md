# Threat Model Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Threat: [Vulnerable Driver Exploitation via Capybara](./threats/vulnerable_driver_exploitation_via_capybara.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Driver Exploitation via Capybara
*   **Description:** Capybara relies on external drivers to interact with browsers. If Capybara is configured to use a vulnerable driver (e.g., outdated Selenium driver), an attacker who can influence the test execution environment or the target application being tested could exploit these driver vulnerabilities *through Capybara's interaction mechanisms*. This could involve crafting specific web page content or test scenarios that trigger driver vulnerabilities when processed by Capybara's driver interaction logic. Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the test environment or manipulation of test results.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the test environment, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the testing process, exfiltrate sensitive data from the test environment, or manipulate test outcomes to hide vulnerabilities in the application under test. This can lead to a false sense of security and deployment of vulnerable applications.
*   **Capybara Component Affected:** Driver interaction layer, specifically how Capybara utilizes and configures drivers (e.g., `Capybara.register_driver`, `Capybara.current_driver`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly enforce driver version management:**  Implement processes to ensure all drivers used with Capybara are kept updated to the latest stable and patched versions.
    *   **Driver vulnerability scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning for drivers into the development and testing pipeline.
    *   **Secure driver sourcing:** Only download drivers from official and trusted sources to avoid compromised driver binaries.
    *   **Isolate test environment:** Run Capybara tests in isolated environments with restricted network access to minimize the impact of potential driver exploits.

## Threat: [Insecure Driver Configuration Amplified by Capybara Usage](./threats/insecure_driver_configuration_amplified_by_capybara_usage.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Driver Configuration Amplified by Capybara Usage
*   **Description:** Capybara's ease of use can sometimes lead to developers overlooking secure driver configurations. For example, if using Selenium Server, developers might inadvertently leave it running with default settings, no authentication, or exposed on a network accessible beyond the test environment. An attacker who gains access to this insecurely configured Selenium Server (or other driver service) *due to Capybara's integration with it* could manipulate test sessions, inject malicious commands into browser interactions initiated by Capybara, or use the driver server as a pivot point to attack the test environment network. Capybara's documentation or common examples might inadvertently promote insecure configurations if security considerations are not explicitly highlighted.
*   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to the test infrastructure, manipulation of automated tests leading to unreliable results, potential pivot point for network attacks, and potential data breach if the test environment is accessible via the driver server.  Compromised CI/CD pipeline integrity.
*   **Capybara Component Affected:**  Capybara configuration and setup, particularly related to driver registration and management (e.g., `Capybara.server_host`, `Capybara.server_port`, driver registration blocks).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure driver configuration guidelines:** Develop and enforce strict guidelines for securely configuring drivers used with Capybara, including authentication, authorization, and network access restrictions.
    *   **Infrastructure-as-Code for test environments:** Use Infrastructure-as-Code to define and provision secure test environments, including driver configurations, ensuring consistency and security.
    *   **Security audits of test setup:** Regularly audit the configuration of test environments and driver setups to identify and remediate insecure configurations.
    *   **Principle of least privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to driver service accounts and network access controls within the test environment.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure through Capybara Test Artifacts](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_through_capybara_test_artifacts.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure through Capybara Test Artifacts
*   **Description:** Capybara tests can generate various artifacts like screenshots, HTML dumps (using `save_page`), and logs. If developers naively use these features without considering security, sensitive data used in tests (e.g., API keys, passwords, PII) might be inadvertently captured in these artifacts. If these artifacts are not properly secured *due to lack of awareness when using Capybara's features*, they could be exposed to unauthorized individuals or systems.  Capybara's ease of generating these artifacts can increase the risk if security implications are not well understood.
*   **Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to misuse of leaked credentials, identity theft, or other forms of harm. Reputational damage and legal liabilities due to data breaches. Compromise of application security if leaked credentials grant access to production systems.
*   **Capybara Component Affected:**  Output generation features like `save_screenshot`, `save_page`, logging mechanisms used in conjunction with Capybara tests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data sanitization in tests:** Implement data sanitization practices within Capybara tests to remove or mask sensitive information before it is used or potentially logged/captured in artifacts.
    *   **Secure artifact storage:** Securely store and manage test logs, screenshots, and other artifacts with appropriate access controls and encryption where necessary.
    *   **Minimize sensitive data in tests:** Avoid using real production data in tests whenever possible. Utilize synthetic or anonymized data.
    *   **Regular artifact review and purging:** Establish policies for regular review and secure purging of test artifacts to minimize the window of exposure for any inadvertently captured sensitive data.
    *   **Educate developers on secure testing practices:** Train developers on secure testing practices with Capybara, emphasizing the risks of sensitive data exposure in test artifacts and how to mitigate them.
