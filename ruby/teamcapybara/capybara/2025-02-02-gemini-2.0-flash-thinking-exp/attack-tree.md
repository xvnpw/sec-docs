## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Capybara](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_capybara.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. All subsequent paths aim to achieve this.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Represents the ultimate failure from a security perspective. Successful compromise can lead to data breaches, service disruption, reputational damage, and financial loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's Feature Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_feature_misuse.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging Capybara's capabilities to interact with the application in ways that expose underlying vulnerabilities. This is a broad category encompassing various web application weaknesses that Capybara can facilitate exploiting.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Capybara's automation and DOM manipulation features make it a potent tool for attackers to probe and exploit common web application vulnerabilities efficiently. It acts as a multiplier for existing application weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Client-Side Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_client-side_validation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using Capybara to directly manipulate the DOM and submit forms, effectively skipping JavaScript-based validation checks performed in the browser.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:**  Trivial to execute with Capybara.
    *   **Medium Impact (Potential Stepping Stone):** While client-side validation is not a primary security control, bypassing it can allow attackers to submit malformed or malicious data that *might* be caught by server-side validation. However, if server-side validation is weak or missing, this bypass becomes a critical first step towards exploiting deeper vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Fixation/Hijacking via Cookie Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/session_fixationhijacking_via_cookie_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Employing Capybara to access and manipulate browser cookies, specifically to set a known session ID. This can be used for session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID) or session hijacking (stealing or predicting a valid session ID).
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** Depends on the application's session management implementation. Vulnerable implementations are unfortunately common.
    *   **High Impact:** Successful session hijacking or fixation leads to account takeover, granting the attacker full access to the victim's account and associated data/privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Automated Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/automated_brute-forcecredential_stuffing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing Capybara to automate login attempts using lists of usernames and passwords (brute-force) or compromised credentials obtained from data breaches (credential stuffing).
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Capybara makes automation of login attempts extremely easy. Credential stuffing is a prevalent and effective attack method due to password reuse.
    *   **High Impact:** Account takeover. If successful on multiple accounts, it can lead to large-scale data breaches and significant damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Automated Form Submission for Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/automated_form_submission_for_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Automating the submission of forms with malicious payloads designed to exploit injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, etc.) using Capybara.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium-High Likelihood:** Injection vulnerabilities are still common in web applications, despite being well-understood. Capybara significantly simplifies the process of testing for and exploiting these vulnerabilities at scale.
    *   **High-Critical Impact:** Injection vulnerabilities can have devastating consequences, ranging from data breaches and data manipulation (SQL Injection) to arbitrary code execution on the server (Command Injection) or client-side code execution and account compromise (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's Dependency Vulnerabilities (Web Drivers)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_dependency_vulnerabilities__web_drivers_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known security vulnerabilities in the web drivers (e.g., Selenium, ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) that Capybara relies upon. This could involve exploiting outdated driver versions with public exploits.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:**  Outdated dependencies are a common security issue. Web drivers, being external components, are also susceptible to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Medium-High Impact:** Exploiting driver vulnerabilities can lead to local privilege escalation on the system running the tests (often development/testing servers), potentially allowing further compromise of the environment and even the application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Web Driver Version](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_web_driver_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically exploiting known vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of a web driver used by Capybara.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** Teams may neglect to update web drivers as diligently as application code.
    *   **Medium-High Impact:** As mentioned above, driver vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Capybara Configuration/Setup](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_capybara_configurationsetup.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Taking advantage of insecure configurations or setups related to Capybara and its web drivers. This could include running drivers with excessive privileges or exposing them on networks without proper security.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Low-Medium Likelihood:** Misconfigurations are possible, especially in less mature development environments or when security best practices are not followed.
    *   **Medium-High Impact:** Insecure configurations can create pathways for unauthorized access to the driver and potentially the underlying system, leading to remote code execution or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Capybara Test Code/Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_capybara_test_codecredentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to sensitive information (test credentials, API keys, internal application details) inadvertently exposed within Capybara test code or configuration files. Common exposure points include public code repositories or insecure storage.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium-High Likelihood:** Developers sometimes mistakenly commit sensitive data to repositories or store configuration files insecurely.
    *   **Medium-High Impact:** Exposed credentials or API keys can grant attackers unauthorized access to test environments, staging environments, or even production systems if test credentials are reused or similar to production credentials. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and further compromise.
