## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Capybara's Interaction with the DOM](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_capybara's_interaction_with_the_dom.md)

* **Inject Malicious Selectors [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: An attacker identifies a way to influence the CSS or XPath selectors used by the application's test suite or, in rare cases, directly by the application logic if it utilizes Capybara's selector capabilities. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how selectors are constructed or by injecting malicious input that is used to build selectors.
    * Consequence: Successful injection allows the attacker to control which elements Capybara interacts with.
* **Cause Capybara to Interact with Unintended Elements:**
    * Attack Vector: By injecting malicious selectors, the attacker can trick Capybara into targeting elements that were not intended for the current operation.
    * Consequence: This can lead to unintended actions being triggered or data being manipulated in unexpected ways.
        * **Trigger Administrative Actions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: The malicious selector targets a button or link that performs an administrative function (e.g., deleting a user, changing permissions). Capybara's action (e.g., `click`) then triggers this function.
            * Consequence: Unauthorized administrative actions are performed.
        * **Modify Sensitive Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: The malicious selector targets an input field containing sensitive data. Capybara's actions (e.g., `fill_in`) are used to change the value of this field.
            * Consequence: Sensitive data is altered or corrupted.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Capybara's Actions - Trigger Unintended Actions via Crafted Input [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_capybara's_actions_-_trigger_unintended_actions_via_crafted_input__critical_n_c0f76569.md)

* **Trigger Unintended Actions via Crafted Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: The attacker crafts specific input values that, when processed by the application, trigger unintended actions or logic flows. Capybara is used to programmatically fill in these values and submit forms.
    * Consequence: The application performs actions that were not intended by the user or developer.
        * **Exploit Loosely Validated Input Fields:**
            * Attack Vector: The application relies primarily on client-side validation, which Capybara can bypass. Backend validation is weak or missing.
            * Consequence: Malicious data can be submitted to the backend.
                * **Submit Malicious Data via Capybara's Fill-in/Click [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    * Attack Vector: Capybara's `fill_in` and `click` methods are used to populate form fields with malicious data (e.g., SQL injection payloads, cross-site scripting payloads) and submit the form.
                    * Consequence: Backend vulnerabilities are exploited, potentially leading to data breaches or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Capybara's Actions - Bypass Client-Side Validation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_capybara's_actions_-_bypass_client-side_validation__critical_node_.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Client-Side Validation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Capybara operates at a level that allows it to interact with DOM elements directly, bypassing client-side JavaScript validation rules.
    * Consequence: Attackers can submit data that would normally be blocked by the browser.
        * **Programmatically Interact with Elements Ignoring Validation:**
            * Attack Vector: Capybara's methods are used to set values in input fields and trigger form submissions without triggering the client-side validation scripts.
            * Consequence: Invalid or malicious data can be sent to the backend.
                * **Submit Invalid Data to Backend [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    * Attack Vector:  Data that violates application rules or constraints (e.g., exceeding length limits, incorrect format) is submitted directly to the backend.
                    * Consequence: This can lead to application errors, data corruption, or exploitation of backend vulnerabilities if not properly handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Capybara's Actions - Manipulate State via Programmatic Navigation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_capybara's_actions_-_manipulate_state_via_programmatic_navigation__critical_n_928cac43.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate State via Programmatic Navigation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Capybara's `visit` method allows direct navigation to specific URLs, bypassing the intended user interface flow.
    * Consequence: Attackers can potentially access restricted areas of the application.
        * **Access Restricted Pages by Directly Navigating with Capybara [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: The attacker uses Capybara to directly navigate to URLs that should only be accessible after authentication or specific authorization checks.
            * Consequence: Unauthorized access to sensitive pages and functionalities.
                * **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    * Attack Vector: The application relies solely on UI-based navigation for enforcing authentication and authorization. By directly navigating, these checks are bypassed.
                    * Consequence: Complete compromise of access controls, allowing the attacker to perform actions as an authenticated user or administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's JavaScript Interaction](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_javascript_interaction.md)

* **Inject Malicious JavaScript via Capybara Actions:**
    * Attack Vector: An attacker finds a way to execute arbitrary Capybara commands, either by compromising the test suite or exploiting a vulnerability in the application that allows execution of Capybara commands.
    * Consequence: This allows the attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
        * **Utilize Capybara's `execute_script` or similar functions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: The attacker uses Capybara's methods for executing JavaScript within the browser context.
            * Consequence: Arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected and executed.
                * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    * Attack Vector: The injected JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser.
                    * Consequence: This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Capybara's Configuration or Integration Weaknesses - Exploit Insecure Capybara Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_capybara's_configuration_or_integration_weaknesses_-_exploit_insecure_capybara_configuratio_c75ede93.md)

* **Exploit Insecure Capybara Configuration:**
    * Attack Vector: Capybara is misconfigured, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
    * Consequence: Attackers can gain access to internal application details.
        * **Access Sensitive Information Exposed in Capybara Logs [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: Capybara logs contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) due to overly verbose logging or insecure log storage.
            * Consequence: Exposure of credentials or other sensitive data that can be used for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Capybara's Configuration or Integration Weaknesses - Exploit Weaknesses in Application's Test Suite](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_capybara's_configuration_or_integration_weaknesses_-_exploit_weaknesses_in_application's_te_9bc0e7eb.md)

* **Exploit Weaknesses in Application's Test Suite:**
    * Attack Vector: The application's test suite, which uses Capybara, is compromised.
    * Consequence: Attackers can manipulate the testing process or gain access to sensitive information.
        * **Inject Malicious Code into Test Scenarios [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: An attacker gains access to the source code repository or development environment and injects malicious code into the test suite.
            * Consequence: The malicious code is executed during testing.
                * **Gain Control over Test Environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    * Attack Vector: The injected code allows the attacker to gain control over the test environment.
                    * Consequence: Access to sensitive test data, manipulation of test results, or pivoting to other systems.
                        * **Potentially Impact Production Deployment Processes [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                            * Attack Vector: In a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline, compromised tests could lead to the deployment of malicious code to production.
                            * Consequence:  Deployment of vulnerable or compromised code to the live application.
