# Attack Surface Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Test Code Containing Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/insecure_test_code_containing_sensitive_information.md)

* **Description:** Test code, written to interact with the application using Capybara, might inadvertently include hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data.
* **How Capybara Contributes:** Capybara scripts directly interact with the application, often requiring authentication or access to protected resources during testing. Developers might embed credentials directly in these scripts for convenience.
* **Example:** A Capybara test script includes `fill_in 'username', with: 'admin'` and `fill_in 'password', with: 'P@$$wOrd123'`. This password could be a real administrative password.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize secure credential management: Store test credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools) and access them within Capybara tests.
    * Avoid hardcoding sensitive data: Never directly embed passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information in test code.
    * Regularly review test code: Conduct code reviews of test scripts to identify and remove any accidentally included sensitive data.
    * Implement access controls for test environments: Restrict access to test environments and the code repositories containing test scripts.
