# Threat Model Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Threat: [Arbitrary JavaScript Execution in Test Context](./threats/arbitrary_javascript_execution_in_test_context.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the test environment through Capybara's JavaScript execution capabilities (e.g., `evaluate_script`, `execute_script`). This could occur if test code uses untrusted input to build JavaScript strings executed by Capybara.
    *   **How:** The attacker might provide malicious JavaScript that, when executed by Capybara, can interact with the browser context, potentially accessing sensitive data within the test environment or manipulating the application's state in unexpected ways during testing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data within the browser during testing (e.g., cookies, local storage). Manipulation of the test environment. In a poorly isolated test environment, this could potentially lead to further exploitation or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Capybara Component:**
    *   **Component:** `Capybara::Session` (methods like `evaluate_script`, `execute_script`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing JavaScript code dynamically from untrusted sources.
    *   Sanitize or validate any dynamic input used in JavaScript execution.
    *   Limit the use of `evaluate_script` and `execute_script` to necessary scenarios.
    *   Ensure the test environment is properly isolated and does not contain sensitive production data.

## Threat: [Test Code as an Attack Vector (if inadvertently deployed)](./threats/test_code_as_an_attack_vector__if_inadvertently_deployed_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** While highly unlikely in properly managed deployments, if test code that uses Capybara is mistakenly included in a production deployment, an attacker could potentially leverage Capybara's methods to interact with the application in unintended ways.
    *   **How:**  If Capybara methods are accessible in the production environment, an attacker could potentially craft requests or interactions that mimic test scenarios to manipulate data or trigger actions they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potential data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Capybara Component:**
    *   **Component:**  Potentially any part of the Capybara API if the library is accessible in the production environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if it occurs, but likelihood is low with proper practices)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly separate test code from production code.
    *   Implement robust build and deployment processes to ensure test dependencies and code are never included in production deployments.
    *   Use dependency management tools to manage different environments.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Test Environment Leading to Missed Vulnerabilities](./threats/overly_permissive_test_environment_leading_to_missed_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that are not apparent in the test environment due to its relaxed security settings.
    *   **How:** If the test environment used with Capybara has security features disabled (e.g., CSRF protection, strict Content Security Policy, relaxed CORS policies), tests might pass even though the application is vulnerable in a production setting.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Failure to detect real-world vulnerabilities, leading to insecure deployments.
*   **Affected Capybara Component:**
    *   **Component:**  Indirectly affects all Capybara interactions as the environment influences the test outcomes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the test environment closely mirrors the security configuration of the production environment.
    *   Enable security features like CSRF protection, enforce appropriate CORS policies, and use realistic Content Security Policies during testing.
    *   Regularly review the security configuration of the test environment.
